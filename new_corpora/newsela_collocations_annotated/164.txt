alliteration

also
used
in

and

or
brand
names


how
to
identify
alliteration
the
best
way
to
<collocation>spot alliteration</collocation>
being
used
in
a
sentence
is
to
sound
out
the
sentence
looking
for
the
words
with
the
<collocation>identical consonant</collocation>
sounds


for
example
read
through
these
sentences
to
test
your
skills
in
identifying
alliteration

keeping


in
each
of
these
examples
the
alliteration
occurs
in
the
words
that
have
the
same
sound


as
you
can
see
not
every
word
must
be
alliterative


you
can
use
prepositions
such
as
of
and
pronouns
such
as
his
and
still
maintain
the
<collocation>alliterative effect</collocation>


alliteration
does
not
need
to
be
an
entire
sentence


any
phrase
can
be
alliterative


even
some
single
words
can
be
alliterative
if
they
have
multiple
syllables
which
begin
with
the
same
consonant
sound


brand
names
and
alliteration
companies
company
use
this
<collocation>alliterative effect</collocation>
all
the
time


the
major
reason
companies
use
this
technique
is
to
ensure
that
their
brand
name
is
memorable


think
for
example
of
all
of
the
famous
and
well
known
brands
and
companies
that
have
used
alliteration
in
their
names

famous

alliteration
<collocation>alliterative names</collocation>
can
also
help
you
stand
out
in
the
crowd
and
can
make
you
more
memorable


for
example
both
fictional
characters

alliteration

can

way

this

tells

the
need
for
people
to
eat
fresh
plant
food
to
help
them
get
through
long
sieges
or
long
sea
trips
was
known
by
some
wise
people
but
was
often
forgotten


the
first
attempt
to
prove
this
idea
was
by
a
ship
doctor
in
the
british
royal
navy
called
james
lind
who
at
sea
in
may
gave
some
crew
members
lemon
juice
as
well
as
their
normal
ships
food
while
others
continued
on
normal
food
alone


the
results
showed
that
lemons
prevented
the
disease


lind
wrote
up
his
work
and
published
it
in


lind
work
was
slow
to
be
noticed


in
the
british
navy
adopted
lemon
or
lime
juice
as
food
for
sailors


as
well
as
lemons
limes
and
oranges
sauerkraut
salted
cabbage
malt
and
soup
were
tried
with
different
effects


james
cook
relied
on
sauerkraut
to
prevent
the
disease
on
his
long
voyages
of
exploration


it
was
believed
that
only
humans
got
scurvy
but
in
and
theodore
two
norwegian
chemists
found
that
guinea
pigs
could
also
get
it
if
not
given

food


in

proved
that
eskimo
people
are
able
to
avoid
scurvy
with
almost
no
plant
food
in
their
diet
by
eating
raw
meat


in
the

american
scientist
funk
first
used
the
word
vitamin
for
something
present
in
food
in
small
amounts
that
is
essential
to
health


he
named
the
unknown
thing
that
prevented

c


from
to
the
hungarian
research
team
of
joseph
l
and
albert
and
separately
the
american
charles
glen
king
first
took
out
vitamin
c
from
food
and
showed
it
to
be
an
acid
they
called
ascorbic
acid


in
the
british
chemists
sir
walter
norman
and
sir
hirst
and
separately
the

successfully
synthesized

it

it

blue


once

reduced
by
addition
of

it
does
not

a

anymore


this

the

turn

again
when

oxidized


purpose
is
often
used
to
measure
the

transport
chain
in

it
has
a
higher
potential
electron
affinity
than
the

in

will
therefore
steal

from

this
means
that

the

of
a
common
way
to
illustrate
this

is
by
