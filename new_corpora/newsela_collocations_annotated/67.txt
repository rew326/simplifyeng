the

a

special

so
the

yet

the

that

would
appear
to

altogether


none

in

an

yet
a

though

however

the

would

as
if
the

this
occurred
only
when

if

the

set

by

any

the

field

by

across

a

emerged


from

the

when

such
that
even
a

fills

however
large


yet
the

is
not
definitely
anywhere
in

field
but
there
at
a
<collocation>definite probability</collocation>
in

to
whether
it
was

the

by
an

of

not
the
particles
but
the
mathematical
form
was
constant


setting
the
field
to
special

permitted
prediction
of
the
complete
electromagnetic

thus
arose
<collocation>relativistic quantum</collocation>
field

of

it

qed


of
the
weak

together
it

of

altogether
this
became
the

of

this
is

some
<collocation>theoretical physicists</collocation>
suspect
that
the
problem
is
in
the
<collocation>standard model</collocation>
which
represents
each

by
a
point
that
in

can
be
infinitely
small


yet
in

the
constant
is
the
minimum
energy
unit
that
a

can
be
divided
into
perhaps
a
clue
to
the
smallest
size
a

can
be


so
there
is
a
quest
to
gravity
to
develop
a
theory
of
quantum
gravity


concept
framework
string
conjectures
that
on
the
microscopic
scale
einstein
spacetime
is
a

of

each
containing

dimensions
curled
up
thus
not
extended
into
the

dimensions
presented
to
the
<collocation>classical realm</collocation>


in
string
theory
each
quantum
particle
is
replaced
by
a
string
of
vibrating
energy
whose
length
is
the
length


as
the
string
moves
it
traces
width
and
thus
becomes
a


as
a
string
vibrates
and
moves
within
the
space
the
string
becomes
a
quantum
particle


with
this
approach
the
hypothetical
graviton
predicted
to
explain
general
relativity
emerges
easily


<collocation>theories string</collocation>
theory
began
as
string
theory
whose
dimensions
act
as
many
fewer


yet
this
modeled
only
which
are
energy
particles
while
omitting
which
are
matter
particles


so
string
theory
could
not
explain
matter


yet
by
adding
to
string
theory
were
achieved
and
string
theory
became
super
string

explaining

too


in
versions
of
quantum

a

vice

that

each

has
a

matter

and
each
matter
particle
has
a
corresponding

yet
the
partner
is
more
massive
and
thus

these
might
seem
an
extravagant
prediction
yet
many

versions

whose
equations
must
otherwise

extravagantly
and
sometimes
arbitrarily

<collocation>mathematical consistency</collocation>
but

controversies
unscientific


string
theory
claim
that
all
molecules
are
strings
of
energy
has
drawn
<collocation>harsh criticism</collocation>


there
are
many
versions
of
string
theory
none
quite
successfully
predicting
the
observational
data
explained
by
the
<collocation>standard model</collocation>


m
theory
is
now
known
to
have
countless
solutions
often
predicting
things
strange
and
unknown
to
exist


some
allege
that
<collocation>string theorists</collocation>
select
only
the
desired
predictions


the
allegation
that
string
theory
makes
no
predictions
is
false
as
it
makes
many


no
theory
a
predictive
and
perhaps
explanatory
model
of
some
domain
of
natural
phenomena
is
verifiable


all
conventional
physical
theories
until
the
<collocation>standard model</collocation>
have
made
claims
about
aspects
of
the
natural
world


even
the
<collocation>standard model</collocation>
has
various
interpretations
as
to
the
natural
world


when
the
<collocation>standard model</collocation>
is
operated
it
is
often
made
a
version
with
doubling
the
number
of
particle
species
so
far
identified
by
particle
physicists


none
can
literally
measure
space
yet
newton
postulated
absolute
space
and
time
and
newton
theory
made
<collocation>explicit predictions</collocation>
highly
and
successful
for
years
but
the
theory
was
still
falsified
as
explanatory
of
nature


physicists
accept
that
there
exists
no
such
attractive
force
directly
attracting
matter
to
matter
let
alone
that
the
<collocation>force traverses</collocation>
the
universe
instantly


and
yet
newton
theory
is
still
paradigmatic
of
science
even
more
scientific
than
the
very
framework
of
biology
the
modern
<collocation>evolutionary synthesis</collocation>


<collocation>hidden dimensions</collocation>


the
idea
of
hidden
dimensionality
of
space
can
seem
occult


some
theorists
of
loop
quantum
gravity
a
contender
for
quantum
gravity
regard
string
theory
as
fundamentally
misguided
by
presuming
that
space
even
has
a
shape
until
particles
shape
it


that
is
they
do
not
doubt
that
space
takes
various
shapes
simply
regard
the
particles
as
determining
space
shape
not
the
other
way
around


the
spacetime
vortex
predicted
by
general
relativity
is
apparently
confirmed


if
interpreted
as
naturally
true
the
<collocation>standard model</collocation>
representing
a
quantum
particle
as
a
point
already
indicates
that
spacetime
is
a
sea
of
roiling
shapes
quantum
foam


<collocation>string theorists</collocation>
tend
to
believe
nature
more
elegant
a
belief
that
<collocation>loop theorist</collocation>
lee
dismisses
as
romantic
while
using
biology
modern
synthesis
as
a
<collocation>rhetorical device</collocation>


experiments
to
detect
added
<collocation>spatial dimensions</collocation>
have
so
far
failed
yet
there
is
still
the
possibility
that
signs
of
them
can
emerge


so
many
solutions


m
theory
has
many
trillions
of
solutions


leonard
a
leader
of
string
theory
interprets
string
theory
plasticity
of
solutions
as
<collocation>paradoxical support</collocation>
resolving
the
mystery
of
why
this
universe
exists
as
m
theory
shows
it
but
a
variant
of
a
general
pattern
that
always
approximately
results


general
relativity
has
brought
many
discoveries
that
in
were
all
but
unimaginable
except
in
fiction


a
solution
of
einstein
equations
that
sought
to
explain
quantum
particles
dynamics
the
bridge
predicts
a
shortcut
connecting
two
distant
points
in
spacetime


commonly
called
a
wormhole
the
bridge
is
doubted
but
not
disproved
showing
either
that
not
all
consequences
of
a
theory
must
be
accurate
or
that
reality
is
quite
bizarre
in
ways


many
worlds
even
the
<collocation>standard model</collocation>
of
particle
physics
suggests
bizarre
possibilities
that
populist
accounts
of
science
either
omit
or
mention
as
unexplained
curiosities


the
theory
conventionally
receives
the
copenhagen
interpretation
whereby
the
field
is
only
possibilities
none
real
until
an
observer
or
instrument
interacts
with
the
field
whose
then
collapses
and
leaves
only
its
particle
function
only
the
particles
being
real


yet
collapse
was
merely
assumed
neither
experimentally
confirmed
nor
even
mathematically
modeled
and
no
variance
from
either
the
in
the
<collocation>quantum realm</collocation>
or
the
particle
function
in
the
<collocation>classical realm</collocation>
has
been
found


in
hugh
described
his
relative
state
interpretation


maintained
that
the
does
not
collapse
and
since
all
matter
and
interactions
are
presumed
to
be
built
up
from
quantum
all
possible
variations
of
the
quantum
field
indicated
by
the
mathematical
equations
are
real
and
simultaneously
occurring
but
different
courses
of
history


by
this
interpretation
whatever
interacts
with
the
field
joins
the
field
state
that
is
relative
to
the
observer
state
itself
a
waveform
in
its
own
quantum
field
while
the
two
simply
interact
in
a
<collocation>universal waveform</collocation>
never
collapsing


by
now
many
physicists
interpretation
of
the
apparent
transition
from
the
quantum
to
the
classical
realms
is
not
collapse
but
quantum


in
an
interaction
with
the
field
takes
the
observer
into
only
one
constellation
of
the
quantum
field
and
so
all
observations
align
with
that
new
combined
quantum
state


thesis
has
inspired
many
<collocation>worlds interpretation</collocation>
whereby
within
our
universe
are
predicted
to
be
virtually
or
potentially
infinite
<collocation>parallel worlds</collocation>
that
are
real
yet
each
a
<collocation>minuscule distance</collocation>
from
the
other
worlds


as
each
world
waveform
is
universal
not
collapsing
and
its
mathematical
relations
are
<collocation>parallel worlds</collocation>
simply
fill
the
gaps
and
do
not
touch


many
universes
einstein
doubted
that
black
holes
as
predicted
by
the
solution
are
real


some
now
conjecture
that
black
holes
do
not
exist
as
such
but
are
dark
energy
or
that
our
universe
is
both
a
black
hole
and
dark
energy


the
solution
of
einstein
equations
can
be
maximally
extended
to
predict
a
black
hole
having
a
flip
side
another
universe
emerging
from
a
white
hole


perhaps
our
universe
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
was
half
of
a
big
bounce
something
collapse
down
to
a
black
hole
and
our
universe
popping
out
its
other
side
as
a
white
hole


particles
are
strings


physicists
widely
doubt
that
quantum
particles
are
truly
points
as
represented
in
<collocation>standard model</collocation>
which
offers
formalism
mathematical
devices
whose
strokes
predict
phenomena
of
interest
upon
input
of
data
not
interpretation
of
the
mechanisms
determining
those
phenomena


yet
<collocation>string theorists</collocation>
do
tend
to
optimistically
conjecture
that
the
strings
are
both
real
and
explanatory
not
merely
<collocation>predictive devices</collocation>


it
is
far
beyond
the
capacity
of
today
<collocation>particle accelerators</collocation>
to
propel
any
probing
particles
at
energy
levels
high
enough
to
overcome
a
quantum
particle
own
energy
and
determine
whether
it
is
a
string


yet
this
limitation
also
exists
on
testing
other
theories
of
quantum
gravity


developments
suggest
other
strategies
to
observe
the
structure
of
quantum
particles


paradoxically
even
if
testing
confirmed
that
particles
are
strings
of
energy
that
still
would
not
conclusively
prove
even
that
particles
are
strings
since
there
could
be
other
explanations
perhaps
an
unexpected
of
space
although
the
particle
was
a
point
of
<collocation>true solidity</collocation>


even
when
predictions
succeed
there
are
many
possible
explanations
the
problem
of
and
philosophers
of
science
as
well
as
some
scientists
do
not
accept
even
flawless
<collocation>predictive success</collocation>
as
verification
of
the
successful
theory
explanations
if
these
are
posed
as
offering
scientific
realism
true
description
of
the
natural
world


matter
is
energy


talk
of
particle
physicists
testing
<collocation>theoretical physicists</collocation>
predicted
particles
by
colliding
particles
in
accelerators
suggests
that
quantum
particles
are
tiny
newtonian
particles
that
crack
open
to
reveal
their
structure


instead
when
two
particles
each
of
a
certain
mass
measured
in
terms
of
energy
as
are
collided
they
can
combine
into
a
particle
of
that
combined
and
the
generated
particle
is
observed
for
correspondence
with
the
prediction


it
is
not
controversial
among
physicists
that
all
particles
are
energy


loop
theorists
sometimes
in
rivalry
with
string
theory
claim
that
spacetime
itself
converts
into
the
particles


matter
being
a
special
variant
of
energy
was
a
consequence
of
einstein
special
theory
of
relativity
and
thereupon
einstein
formalized
the
e
mc


when
sufficiently
<collocation>energetic photons</collocation>
collide
they
can
combine
and
generate
matter
matter
creation


all
particles
have
and
atoms
of
matter
have
of
antimatter
whose
union
annihilates
the
particles
and
matter
while
leaving
energy


developments
an
inspiring
development
is
discovery
of
<collocation>mirror symmetry</collocation>
whereby
spaces
tend
to
come
in
pairs
such
that
solutions
previously
difficult
within
the
extreme
mode
of
one
string
can
be
solved
by
through
the
mirror
space
geometry
in
its
opposite
range


string
theory
is
usually
solved
through
field
theory
a
quantum
field
theory
on
space


it
is
confirmed
that
molecules
can
collapse
to


and
the
electron
long
presumed
an
elementary
particle
apparently
splits
into
three
entities
separately
carrying
the
electron
three
degrees
of
freedom
when
the
molecules
that
contain
the
electrons
are
channeled
through
a
pathway


a
scientist
is
a
person
who
works
in
science


a
scientist
tries
to
understand
how
our
world
or
other

work

ask
questions

extensive
research
work

to
these
