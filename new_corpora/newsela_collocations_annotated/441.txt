one
such
level
in
english
is
called
full
<collocation>frontal nudity</collocation>


this
usually
is
a
pose
where
the
nude
person
faces
the
viewer


in
this
pose
there
are
no
things
covering
parts
of
the
body


many
societies
see
this
as
very
bad


the
image
below
called
truth
shows
this
pose


most
movies
try
not
to
show
this
type
of
nudity


this
is
often
done
by
putting
an
object
somewhere


this
object
will
hide
the
pubic
area
of
the
naked
actor
or
actress


this
kind
of
nudity
can
also
be
seen
in
the
picture
woman
bathing
above


since
the
very
early
ages
nudity
has
been
a
subject
of
the
arts


one
of
the
earliest
works
of
art
known
is
the
venus
of


it
is
a
statuette
a
small
statue
of
a
nude
woman


the
face
of
the
woman
is
not
visible


the
belly
of
the
woman
as
well
as
her
breasts
are
exaggerated


it
is
not
known
what
the
statuette
meant
to
the
people
who
made
it
or
what
importance
it
had


from
the
renaissance
onward
nude
figures
were
shown
in
works
of
art
more
often


michelangelo
is
one
of
the
renaissance
artists
known
for
doing
this


nudity
in
photography
since
the
beginning
of
photography
people
have
taken
photographs
of
nude
people


some
people
simply
photographed
nude
people


some
of
the
photographs
were
made
to
sexually
arouse
people


these
are
generally
called
pornography


some
people
also
photographed
nude
people
because
they
thought
the
human
body
was
something
beautiful
to
show


these
photos
are
usually
not
sexual
in
nature
and
are
known
as
nude
photography


the
kind
of
photography
that
is
in
between
is
called
<collocation>erotic photography</collocation>


nudity
in
different
times
adam
and
eve
in
the
garden
of
eden
<collocation>old testament</collocation>
and
judaism
the
creation
story
in
the
<collocation>old testament</collocation>
of
the
bible
mentions
nudity
as
a
sign
of
innocence


only
after
adam
and
eve
have
eaten
from
the
tree
of
knowledge
do
they
become
aware
of
their
nudity
and
start
to
feel
ashamed


theologians
see
this
feeling
of
shame
as
a
consequence
of
the
fall
from
grace


because
of
this
they
are
later
chased
away
from
the
garden
of
eden


the
bible
does
not
make
a
distinction
between
shame
as
a
consequence
of
not
obeying
a
rule
and
the
shame
resulting
from
nudity


the
<collocation>old testament</collocation>
often
sees
nudity
as
a
consequence
of
being
poor
or
of
being
a
<collocation>social outcast</collocation>


it
is
not
seen
as
a
result
of
breaking
rules
and
accepted


later
orthodox
judaism
sees
nakedness
as
a
bad
thing


ancient
greece
in
ancient
greece
especially
ancient
athens
people
did
not
see
a
problem
with
nude
men


nude
women
were
seen
as
bad
though
and
women
were
forbidden
from
being
nude
in
public


the
cynics
taught
that
it
was
bad
to
have
worldly
goods


feelings
like
shame
were
also
seen
as
bad


there
was
nothing
wrong
with
being
naked


the
shows
by
its
name
alone
that
public
nudity
was
not
common
in
ancient
greece


the
name
comes
form
which
means
naked


the
was
used
for
sports


in
ancient
greece
most
sports
were
done
totally
naked


in
most
places
in
ancient
greece
women
were
forbidden
from
doing
sports
or
from
attending
sports
events


the
only
place
were
women
were
allowed
to
do
sports
was
sparta


there
they
also
did
sports
like
the
men
but
separated
from
these


they
were
also
naked
while
doing
sports


another
place
where
nakedness
was
tolerated
was
in
the
arts


ancient
rome
celts
german
tribes
in
ancient
rome
nudity
was
nothing
special
or
unusual


it
was
seen
more
as
a
sign
of
not
needing
much


people
did
not
attach
sexual
feelings
to
it


when
the
romans
had
conquered
ancient
greece
they
did
not
think
it
was
necessary
to
discuss
or
forbid
that
the
olympic
games
were
done
in
the
nude


the
elder
mentions
that
usually
the
virtuous
roman
worked
nude
during
the
summer
months


the
celtic
and
<collocation>germanic tribes</collocation>
bathed
nude
in
rivers
and
lakes
together
and
that
sometimes
children
grew
up
nude


romans
also
tell
us
that
some
of
them
fought
the
romans
in
the
nude


two
sadhu
near
temple
in
nepal
and
hinduism
both
and
hinduism
have
special
monks


in
these
are
called
or
in
hinduism
they
are
called


both
lead
an
ascetic
lifestyle
and
are
in
their
community


part
of
this
lifestyle
is
that
they
wear
little
or
no
clothes


nudity
and
sexuality
many
cultures
that
expect
some
level
of
modesty
<collocation>associate nudity</collocation>
with
sexuality


these
cultures
usually
know
striptease
in
some
form


when
the
difference
between
the
sexes
is
shown
in
the
main
stream
media
of
these
cultures
this
is
often
seen
as
sexually
related


in
latin
cultures
the
common
definition
of
modesty
does
not
generally
allow
<collocation>genital nudity</collocation>
but
the
definition
of
what
is
lewd
has
changed
and
women
breasts
are
now
commonly
exposed
or
depicted
without
scandal


nudity
in
front
of
a
sexual
partner
is
widely
accepted
but
there
may
be
restrictions
for
example
only
at
the
time
and
place
of
sex
or
with
subdued
lighting
during
bathing
with
the
partner
or
afterwards
covered
by
a
sheet
or
blanket
or
while
sleeping


public
nudity
nudity
in
sports
in
ancient
greece
it
was
seen
as
normal
that
the
athletes
taking
part
in
sporting
events
like
the
olympic
games
were
nude
for
most
events


at
that
time
women
were
not
allowed
to
take
part
or
in
the
games
or
watch
them


nudity
with
women
was
frowned
upon


common
activities
in
the
nude
at
least
since
the
early
century
there
is
a
movement
of
people
wanting
to
do
some
things
together
while
they
were
nude


sometimes
it
was
just
seen
functionally
like
a
common
bath
in
a
pond
or
lake


some
people
do
other
activities
together
in
the
nude
where
being
naked
is
usually
not
required


for
instance
some
people
prefer
nude
sunbathing
when
otherwise
a
swimsuit
could
be
worn


there
are
some
nude
bicycle
tours


this
movement
is
generally
known
as
or
nudism


in
a
small
swiss
canton
voted
to
stop
nude
hiking


german
tourists
have
been
walking
nude
through
the
alps
wearing
only
boots
socks
and
a
back
pack


the
canton
will
fine
nude
hikers
swiss
francs


nudity
and
health
the
movement
of
the
century
claims
that
being
nude
is
healthy


starting
in
reformer
arnold
said
that
sun
and
is
a
good
thing
and
that
it
can
only
give
its
full
potential
when
done
in
the
nude


many
of
these
views
have
been
proved
wrong
today


not
smoking
or
drinking
alcohol
is
good
for
health
regardless
of
whether
clothing
is
worn
or
not


people
suffering
from
being
exposed
too
little
to
the
sun
will
also
be
so
if
they
are
clothed


wearing
wet
clothes
can
lead
to
an
infection
of
the
urinary
bladder


some
doctors
recommend
sleeping
in
comfortable
clothes
or
sleeping
naked


at
some
points
in
time
fashion
dictates
very
clothes


these
can
be
bad
for
health


nudity
as
a
form
of
protest
some
people
use
the
nudity
as
a
form
of
protest
like
a
movement
in
the
united
states
that
wants
equal
treatment
of
men
and
women


this
movement
fights
for
the
right
of
women
to
be
topless


often
this
is
done
with
<collocation>topless demonstrations</collocation>


one
example
that
nudity
was
used
as
a
form
of
protest
even
in
the
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>
is
the
story
of
<collocation>lady godiva</collocation>


she
is
said
to
have
ridden
through
coventry
totally
naked
only
covered
by
her
long
hair


she
did
this
to
protest
against
the
high
taxes


<collocation>nude girl</collocation>
distributing

<collocation>parade nudity</collocation>
for
commercial
reasons
nudity
is
often
used
to
draw
the
attention
of
customers
to
a
given
product


that
way
nude
people
or
people
with
very
little
clothing
are
often
shown
on
covers
of
magazines
even
if
the
content
of
the
magazine
has
nothing
to
do
with
nudity


naked
people
sometimes
in
connection
with
body
painting
are
used
to
distribute
fliers
at
events


this
uses
erotic
stimuli
especially
to
people
of
the
opposite
sex


on
the
other
hand
nudity
seems
to
work
all
by
itself
in
such
contexts


nudity
in
public
places
is
rare
and
people
generally
do
not
expect
it


the
more
it
is
used
however
the
less
it
will
act
on
people


at
some
point
it
will
have
become
normal


nudity
and
children
two
children
bathing
in
a
small
metal
bathtub
most
children
do
not
develop
a
feeling
of
shame
until
they
are
about
five
years
old


for
this
reason
there
have
been
discussions


these
discussions
try
to
answer
two
basic
questions
should
children
see
naked
adults


should
children
see
each
other
naked


different
people
have
different
opinions
on
the
subject


nude
children
works
of
art
such
as
paintings
statues
or
photographs
have
shown
nude
children
or
nude
children
with
nude
adults


in
recent
years
showing
nude
children
has
become
more
and
more
problematic
especially
with
photographs


in
a
few
cases
photographs
taken
by
parents
showing
their
toddler
or
small
child
naked
have
been
seen
as
child
pornography
by
courts


in
may
police
in
sydney
australia
raided
an
exhibition
by
the
photographer
bill


this
exhibition
showed
images
of
naked
children


the
raid
was
done
on
allegations
of
child
pornography


incidents
such
as
this
one
sent
a
strong
message
to
the
community


children
seeing
their
parents
nude
people
can
not
agree
if
parents
should
appear
naked
in
front
of
their
children


and
say
that
there
is
a
wide
variation
on
parental
nudity
from
family
to
family


according
to
them
there
is
nothing


wrong
with
bathing
with
children
or
otherwise
appearing
naked
in
front
of
them


in
their
opinion
doing
so
may
provide
an
opportunity
for
parents
to
give
important
information


they
note
that
by
ages
five
to
six
children
begin
to
develop
a
sense
of
modesty
and
recommend
to
parents
who
wish
to
be
sensitive
to
their
children
wishes
that
they
limit
such
activities
from
that
age
onwards


recommends
against
nudity
in
the
home
where
children
are
showing
sexual
behavior
considered
problematic


a
study
by
alfred
found
that
of
the
participants
stated
that
there
was
never
nudity
in
the
home
when
they
were
growing
up
of
them
said
that
there
was
seldom
nudity
in
the
home
said
often
and
said
that
it
was
usual


the
study
found
that
there
was
no
significant
difference
between
what
was
reported
by
men
and
by
women
with
respect
to
frequency
of
nudity
in
the
home


in
a
review
of
the
literature
paul
concluded
that
there
was
no
reliable
evidence
linking
exposure
to
parental
nudity
to
any
negative
effect


three
years
later
his
team
finished
an
longitudinal
study
that
showed
that
if
anything
such
exposure
was
associated
with
slight
beneficial
effects
particularly
for
boys


children
seeing
other
people
nude
different
cultures
have
different
opinions
on
whether
children
should
see
people
other
than
their
parents
and
other
children
naked


in
general
the
opinions
are
also
different
depending
on
how
old
the
child
is
and
what
context
the
nudity
is
placed
in


many
countries
have
made
laws
that
should
protect
children
from
seeing
sex
scenes
by
accident


that
way
such
scenes
may
usually
not
be
shown
during
the
day


british
tv
must
not
show
such
scenes
between
am
and


this
is
called
watershed


the
broadcasting
code
requires
that
nudity
before
the
watershed
must
be
justified
by
the
context


children
showering
together
sometimes
the
nudity
of
children
in
front
of
other
children
has
been
an
issue


in
europe
it
is
common
that
all
students
take
a
shower
together
after
sports
classes


usually
showering
is
segregated
by
sex


in
the
united
states
and
some
of
canada
students
at
tax
funded
schools
have
historically
been
required
to
shower
with
classmates
of
the
same
sex
after
physical
education
classes


in
the
united
states
public
objections
and
the
threat
of
lawsuits
have
resulted
in
a
number
of
school
districts
in
recent
years
changing
policy
to
make
showers
optional


a
court
case
in
the
state
of
colorado
noted
that
students
have
a
reduced
expectation
of
personal
privacy
in
regards
to
communal
undress
while
showering
after
physical
education
classes


according
to
an
interview
with
a
middle
school
principal
most
objections
to
school
showers
that
he
had
heard
were
actually
from
the
student
parents
rather
than
from
the
student


nudity
as
a
<collocation>punishment prisoner</collocation>
abuse
including
forced
nudity
and
humiliation
at
the
abu
prison
facility
in
iraq
was
widely
condemned


most
people
feel
uneasy
or
ashamed
when
they
are
nude
outside
a
social
context
where
this
is
acceptable


this
fact
has
been
used
both
as
a
means
of
torture
and
as
a
punishment


that
way
during
the
alleged
witches
were
stripped
to
discover
what
was
called
the
witches
mark


it
was
believed
that
the
devil
left
this
mark
as
part
of
the
pact
the
witch
had
with
him


when
the
mark
was
found
this
was
then
used
as
evidence
in
the
trials


nakedness
can
also
be
part
of
a
punishment
or
a
public
humiliation


torture
manuals
sometimes
make
a
difference
as
men
and
women
react
differently
when
they
are
disrobed
