a
rainbow
is
an
arc
of
color
in
the
sky
that
can
be
seen
when
the
sun
shines
through
falling
rain


the
pattern
of
colors
starts
with
red
on
the
outside
and
changes
through
orange
yellow
green
blue
indigo
to
violet
on
the
inside


a
rainbow
is
created
when
light
is
bent
refracted
while
entering
a
droplet
of
water
and
reflected


a
rainbow
is
actually
round


on
the
ground
the
bottom
part
is
hidden
but
in
the
sky
like
from
a
flying
airplane
it
can
be
seen
as
a
circle


rainbows
are
popular
symbols
that
can
mean
peace
and
harmony


rainbows
are
also
used
as
symbols
of
<collocation>gay pride</collocation>


cause
rainbow
in
a
thunderstorm
that
is
moving
away
at

the
rainbow
effect
can
be
seen
when
there
are
water
drops
in
the
air
and
the
sun
is
giving
light
at
the
back
of
the
observer
at
a
low
distance
up
or
angle


the
<collocation>rainbow displays</collocation>
with
the
deepest
effect
in
our
minds
take
place
when
half
of
the
sky
is
still
dark
with
draining
clouds
and
the
observer
is
at
a
place
with
clear
sky
above


another
common
place
to
see
the
rainbow
effect
is
near
waterfalls


parts
of
rainbows
can
be
seen
some
of
the
time
at
the
edges
of
clouds
lit
from
the
back
or
as
upright
bands
of
spectrum
in
far
away
rain
even
if
it
does
not
fall
on
the
earth


an
unnatural
rainbow
effect
can
also
be
made
putting
drops
of
water
into
the
air
on
a
sunny
day

seven
colors
of
the

the

colors
can
only
be

cia
headquarters
the
central
<collocation>intelligence agency</collocation>
cia
is
a
part
of
the
united
states
government


the
agency
was
formed
after
<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii


the
cia
is
made
up
of
four
groups
that
each
do
different
things


their
goal
is
to
protect
the
us
people
and
kill
all
terrorists


many
people
feel
that
the
cia
does
more
bad
than
good


some
people
feel
that
the
cia
does
good
by
finding
out
secret
information
about
enemies
of
the
united
states


american
law
prohibits
the
cia
and
other
agencies
from
killing
foreign
leaders


in
tried
to
kill
former
president
george
bush
who
used
to
be
director
of
the
cia
during
a
visit
to
kuwait


the
assassination
plot
was
not
successful


in
retaliation
then
president
ordered
<collocation>cruise missiles</collocation>
to
be
fired
at
the
building
of
the
iraqi
equivalent
to
the
cia


this
occurred
at
night
so
only
the
janitors
were
killed
not
those
who
planned
the
assassination


cia
has
many
clandestine
or
secret
operations
that
people
not
working
for
the
cia
will
most
likely
never
find
out
about


some
cia
employees
have
been
killed
while
working
but
their
identities
are
so
secret
that
they
are
represented
only
by
a
star
not
a
name
at
a
cia
memorial


the
cia
also
uses
open
sources
to
gather
information


analysts
read
foreign
newspapers
and
watch
foreign
news
broadcasts
to
learn
information
which
can
be
pieced
together
to
make
a
conclusion


the
cia
used
to
report
to
the
president


after
the
september
terrorist
attacks
in
the
united
states
there
was
a
reorganization
so
that
the
cia
along
with
other
<collocation>intelligence agencies</collocation>
report
to
a
newly
created
director


the
cia
has
been
