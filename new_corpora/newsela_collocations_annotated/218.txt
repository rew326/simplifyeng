for
example
education
health
care
housing
utility
companies
or
public
transportation
are
some
industries
that
might
be
by
the
government
in
a
socialist
system


for
the
most
part
people
working
in
these
industries
are
paid
by
the
government
with
money
paid
by
the
people
as
taxes


welfare
is
likely
offered
under
socialism


another
kind
of
socialism
is


in
this
system
money
and
goods
are
shared
more
equally
among
the
people
with
the
government
in
control


in
theory
this
system
results
in
the
divide
between
classes
getting
smaller
with
the
poorest
of
a
nation
people
being
better
cared
for
while
the
richest
accept
higher
taxes
and
economic
regulations


of
course
socialism
as
it
is
commonly
practiced
differs
in
many
ways
from
communism
see
the
history
of
socialism
and
communism
later
in
the
article


today
many
democratic
socialists
especially
in
western
europe
want
industries
to
be
guided
jointly
together
by
representatives
of
shareholders
as
well
as
the
workers
working
together
in
what
is
known
as
an
industrial
democracy
because
both
groups
have
interests
in
the
success
of
the
enterprise


this
would
be
a
more
direct
democratic
way
of
organizing
rather
than
control
by
central
government


<collocation>trade unions</collocation>
workers
councils
would
represent
the
interests
of
the
employees


many
countries
see
socialism
differently


social
democracy
for
example
a
democratic
form
of
socialism
is
the
most
common
kind
of
government
in
the
world


socialist
international
is
an
organization
dedicated
to
the
cause
of
promoting
<collocation>socialist ideals</collocation>
and
has
ties
with
many
socialist
parties
especially
social
democratic
ones


most
people
say
communism
when
they
mean
the
marxist
and
leninist
ideas
of
russia
bolshevik
party


marx
believed
that
capitalism
followed
the
economic
and
political
system
of
feudalism


he
also
believed
that
capitalism
would
oppress
many
people
and
those
people
would
eventually
revolt
and
use
socialism


then
he
thought
that
socialism
can
be
another
bridge
but
to
communism


however
many
people
incorrectly
use
the
term
communist
to
refer
to
a
socialist
state


others
call
this
state
socialism
to
distinguish
it
from
the
communist
goal
that
does
not
need
a
state
or
any
form
of
government


to
the
word
socialism
is
now
mostly
used
for
attempts
to
come
close
to
this
goal
in
a
democratic
state


often
in
united
states
politics
socialism
is
used
as
a
slur
against
liberals
by
conservatives


history
a
welshman
robert
was
the
first
socialist


his
followers
began
calling
themselves
socialists
in


he
is
still
regarded
as
a
pioneer
of
the
movement
in
britain


he
said
that
workers
should
own
the
companies
they
worked
for


the
workers
would
then
share
the
profits
among
themselves


he
set
up
a
new
model
factory
in
new
scotland


marx
is
most
well
known
however
as
the
architect
of
the
theory
of
socialism
and
communism


he
wrote
the
comprehensive
book
about
capitalism
socialism
and
communism
called
the
<collocation>communist manifesto</collocation>


the
book
and
paid
for
much
of
marx
work
and
research


many
socialist
political
parties
were
formed
during
the
century
and
early
part
of
the
century


political
parties
are
generally
newer

happened
for
ten
months

were
fought
over
who
controlled

divides
the

iraq

into

on

the
pretext

this

relations
between
the
united
states
and
iraq
remained
tense
after
the
gulf
war


the
launched
a
missile
attacked
aimed
at
iraq
intelligence
headquarters
in
baghdad
june
believing
evidence
that
iraq
had
sponsored
a
plot
to
kill
former
president
george
bush


the
un
placed
a
trade
embargo
on
iraq
blocking
iraqi
oil
exports


this
caused
hardship
in
iraq
and
almost
destroyed
the
iraqi
economy
and
state
infrastructure


only
smuggling
across
the
syrian
border
and
humanitarian
aid
kept
iraq
from
crisis


later
limited
amounts
of
income
from
the
united
nations
program
started
flowing
into
iraq


on
december
the
united
nations
allowed
baghdad
to
begin
selling
limited
amounts
of
oil
for
food
and
medicine


officials
continued
to
accuse
of
violating
the
terms
of
the
gulf
war
cease
fire
by
developing
weapons
of
mass
destruction
and
other
banned
weaponry
and
violating
the
sanctions
and
no

zones


isolated
military
strikes
by
and
british
forces
continued
on
iraq
the
largest

after
two
years
of
<collocation>intermittent activity</collocation>
and
british
warplanes
struck
harder
at
sites
near
baghdad
in
february


base
of
tribesmen
family
members
and
other
supporters
was
divided
after
the
war
and
in
the
following
years
adding
to
the
regime
increasingly
repressive
and
arbitrary
nature


domestic
repression
inside
iraq
grew
worse
and
sons
and
became
increasingly
powerful
and
carried
out
a
private
reign
of
terror


they
likely
had
a
leading
hand
when
in
august
two
of
who
held
high
positions
in
the
iraqi
military
defected
to
jordan


both
were
killed
after
returning
to
iraq
the
following
february


invasion
of
iraq
invasion
of
iraq
the
main
reason
for
the
invasion
was
the
claim
by
the
bush
administration
that
has


he
was
seen
as
a
major
threat
to
western
allies
such
as
<collocation>saudi arabia</collocation>
and
israel
to
western
oil
supplies
from
the
persian
gulf
states
and
to
middle
east
stability
generally


bush
successor
president
bill
maintained
sanctions
and
made
occasional
air
strikes
in
the
iraqi
zones
or
other
restrictions
in
the
hope
that
would
be
overthrown
by
his
many
political
enemies


the
domestic
political
equation
changed
in
the
after
the
september
attacks
which
added
to
the
influence
of
the
neoconservative
faction
in
the
presidential
administration
and
throughout
washington


in
his
january
message
to
congress
george
bush
the
son
of
george
bush
spoke
of
an
axis
of
evil
comprising
iran
north
korea
and
iraq


as
the
war
was
looming
on
february
talked
with
news
anchor
dan
rather
for
more
than
three
hours
his
first
interview
with
a
reporter
in
over
a
decade


aired
the
taped
interview
later
that
week


the
iraqi
government
and
military
collapsed
in
three
weeks
of
the
beginning
of
the
invasion
of
iraq
on
march


the
united
states
made
at
least
two
attempts
to
kill
with
targeted
air
strikes
but
both
failed
to
hit
their
target


by
the
beginning
of
april
coalition
forces
had
much
of
iraq


the
resistance
of
the
iraqi
army
either
crumbled
or
shifted
to
<collocation>guerrilla tactics</collocation>
and
it
appeared
that
had
lost
control
of
iraq


he
was
last
seen
in
a
video
which
showed
him
in
the
baghdad
suburbs
surrounded
by
supporters


when
baghdad
fell
to
the
coalition
on
april
was
nowhere
to
be
found


was
also
accused
by
the
bush
administration
of
being
part
of
al


that
has
never
been
proven
and
there
is
no
evidence
ever
had
any
ties


people
in
the
bush
administration
including
the
vice
president
dick
will
forever
claim
otherwise


mostly
to
justify
the
largely
perceived
illegal
invasion


pursuit
and
capture
even
when
baghdad
was
taken
over
and
most
of
the
fighting
had
stopped
people
still
did
not
know
where
was
