been
killed
when
they
could
not
control
their
aircraft


the
<collocation>wright brothers</collocation>
fixed
the
problem
by
building
wings
that
could
be
twisted

the
bishop
boys

crouch


and
moved
up
and
down
slightly


from
to
they
built
gliders
in
dayton
and
tested
them
in
kitty
hawk
where
there
were
strong
and
steady
winds


during
these
years
they
also
made
small
versions
of
the
wings
and
built
a
wind
tunnel
to
test
how
well
different
wing
shapes
would
lift
an
airplane


first
flight
in
they
built
a
powered
airplane
that
had
a
propeller
and
a
light
but
powerful
engine


the
<collocation>wright flyer</collocation>
airplane
first
flew
successfully
on
december
in
kitty
hawk
north
carolina


this
was
the
first
time
people
ever
flew
a
powered
airplane
they
could
control


before
that
people
flew
in
balloons
or
gliders
or
for
a
very
short
time
in
planes
they
could
control


the
two
brothers
continued
to
make
changes
to
their
design
and
had
a
very
good
plane
