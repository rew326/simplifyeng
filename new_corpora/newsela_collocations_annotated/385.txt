a
variable
is
a
special
type
of
amount
or
quantity
with
an
unknown
value


they
are
often
used
in
programming
computers
or
in
mathematical
equations


a
number
such
as
or
can
not
change
its
value


for
example
if
a
person
stands
feet
away
from
a
building
the
distance
variable
compared
to
the
building
does
not
change
over
time


feet
is
called
a
fixed
amount
which
is
the
opposite
of
a
variable
amount


but
if
a
person
walks
away
from
the
building
the
distance
variable
compared
to
the
building
is
increasing


so
it
does
not
have
the
same
value
and
we
can
not
use
the
same
number
for
it
as
the
distance
might
be
foot
now
but
feet
a
second
later


in
mathematics
a
variable
is
usually
given
a
letter
such
as
x
or
y


in
some
equations
variables
are
used
to
show
numbers
that
are
unknown


using
a
type
of
math
called
algebra
one
can
find
the
value
of
the
variable


in
computer
science
a
variable
does
not
have
to
be
a
number
it
may
be
a
string
text
value
or
a
date
or
an
amount
of
money
or
even
an
object
such
as

and
miners
in

north
and
held
rallies
in
the
big
cities


found
it
hard
to
win
an
election
because
of
the
successful
<collocation>scare campaigns</collocation>
launched
by
opposing
parties
many
financed
by
large
corporations
and
powerful
national
institutions
such
as
private
banks
and
schools


results
finally
and
to
the
surprise
of
many
working
people
who
had
voted
for
him
in
previous
elections
and
felt
he
would
never
win
in
he
won
and
became
the
president
of
chile


goals
always
ran
for
election
on
the
same
socialist
platform
plan
proposing
the
same
resolutions
things
to
be
done
focusing
on
the
persistent
inequality
in
the
country
and
the
poverty
for
large
part
of
the
population
which
saw
as
being
rooted
in
the
lack
of
control
the
chilean
people
had
over
their
natural
resources
and
<collocation>vital industries</collocation>


banks
copper
mines
electricity
companies


promised
that
he
would
put
under
control
of
government
<collocation>vital industries</collocation>
and
then
create
an
advanced
public
health
system
and
educational
system
that
would
be
free
and
accessible
to
all


during
the
cold
war
between
the
and
the
former
many
people
feared
that
chile
would
fall
under
the
influence
of
the
ussr
and
after
the
under
the
influence
of
cuba


revolutionary
change
speeches
were
said
to
be
very
radical
extreme
and
vision
for
chile
seemed
completely
different
to
the
chile
that
most
people
were
familiar
with


for
example
was
said
to
be
an
atheist
and
marxist


he
was
a
non
practicing
catholic
this
was
considered
odd
in
a
country
that
was
very
catholic
held
traditional
<collocation>family values</collocation>
and
in
which
people
were
taught
that
political
freedoms
the
freedom
to
elect
politicians
from
different
parties
was
more
important
than
solving
problems
such
as
extreme
poverty
or
economic
inequality
division
between
the
poorest
and
the
wealthiest
people


also
wanted
revolutionary
change
he
wanted
deep
changes
to
chilean
society
very
quickly
such
forms
of
changes
have
been
said
to
have
tended
to
cause
great
divisions
in
society
between
those
who
oppose
the
changes
called
reactionaries
and
those
who
support
the
drastic
changes
revolutionaries


through
history
such
situations
tend
to
end
up
resolved
violently


for
example
civil
war
where
one
group
of
people
fight
another
group
of
people
of
the
same
country
or
military
coup
when
a
government
is
overthrown
before
it
finishes
his
term


results
as
a
result
many
especially
professionals
like
university
professors
doctors
and
business
people
left
the
country
this
had
a
negative
effect
on
reforms


increased
health
services
and
places
at
universities
for
the
underprivileged
while
many
professors
specialists
and
doctors
were
leaving
the
country


supporters
marching
in
chile
<collocation>peaceful revolution</collocation>
however
was
unique
in
that
he
did
all
he
could
to
prevent
this
sort
of
violence
calling
his
revolution
a
peaceful
one
within
democracy
or
calling
it
the
chilean
road
to
socialism


in
enemies
accused
him
of
preparing
a
secret
war
and
that
his
supporters
were
hoarding
stocks
of
illegal
weapons
in
<collocation>shanty towns</collocation>
and
in
rural
areas
that
were
being
sent
from
communist
cuba


to
prove
that
this
was
not
true
allowed
the
chilean
army
to
enforce
a
weapons
control
law
that
allowed
the
chilean
military
to
search
and
comb
for
any
illegal
weapons
anywhere
in
the
country


the
chilean
army
confirmed
that
after
thoroughly
searching
for
such
weapons
throughout
the
country
they
had
found
no
<collocation>significant stocks</collocation>
as
the
opposition
was
claiming
