it
is
difficult
to
compress
a
liquid


if
a
liquid
is
cooled
down
until
it
is
colder
than
a
certain
temperature
it
will
become
a
solid


this
temperature
is
called
the
melting
point
and
is
different
for
every
different
type
of
liquid


the
freezing
point
of
water
is
around
c
and
it
becomes
ice


if
a
liquid
is
heated
up
it
becomes
a
gas


the
temperature
this
happens
at
is
called
the
<collocation>boiling point</collocation>


the
<collocation>boiling point</collocation>
of
water
is
c
at
this
temperature
it
becomes
steam


examples
of
liquid
are
water
oils
and
blood


in
a
liquid
the
liquid
on
the
top
presses
down
on
the
liquid
underneath
so
at
the
bottom
the
pressure
p
is
bigger
than
at
the
top


the
equation
for
working
this
out
is
p
where
z
is
the
depth
of
the
point
below
the
surface
and
g
is
how
strong
gravity
is
pulling
on
the
liquid


is
a
number
that
tells
us
how
heavy
a
set
amount
of
the
liquid
is


we
call
this
the
density
and
it
is
different
for
all
liquids
