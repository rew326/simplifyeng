the
portrait
shows
louis
with

his
was

of

by
the

several
absolute

who
had
their

made
wanted
them
to
be
close
to
this
picture
monarchy
is
one
of
the
oldest
kinds
of
government


most
historians
agree
that
the
first
monarchies
were
tribes
or
small
groups
of
people
who
decided
to
let
a
or
other
leader
pass
on
their
office
to
their
children


over
time
the
rules
for
deciding
who
got
to
become
the
next
monarch
became
more
complicated


in
general
the
oldest
son
or
in
some
countries
daughter
gets
to
become
the
next
monarch
when
the
old
one
dies


kings
and
other
kinds
of
monarchs
have
been
around
for
many
thousands
of
years
there
are
many
for
example
mentioned
in
the
bible
as
well
as
ancient
historical
records


three
of
the
oldest
countries
with
monarchs
that
still
hold
office
are
the
<collocation>united kingdom</collocation>
where
the
present
line
of
kings
and
queens
has
been
around
for
nearly
years
denmark
where
the
royal
line
has
remained
unbroken
for
almost
years
and
japan
which
has
records
showing
a
line
of
emperors
dating
back
even
farther


many
monarchs
today
perform
mostly
the
<collocation>ceremonial jobs</collocation>
of
a
head
of
state
while
the
head
of
government
who
is
usually
elected
passes
and
enforces
laws


it
is
also
very
important

other
parts
of
the

the
monarch
is
the
only
source
of
all
laws
and
the
monarch
can
make
any
law
they
want
just
by
deciding
it


any
other
institution
in
the
country
can
not
make
laws
that
affect
the

unless
the
monarch
decides
to
allow
it


sometimes
the
monarch
is
also
the

and
makes
religious
laws
also


all
land
and
property
in
the
country
can
be
taken
or
given
away
by
the
monarch
at
any
time
for
any

the
army
and

is
under
the
personal
control
of
the
monarch
and
can
be
used
for
any

at

time


the
monarch
can
also
pick
who
gets
to
be
the
next
monarch
and
can
change
the
rules
at
any
time


there
is
usually
no
elected
government
or
parliament
and
if
there
is
one
it
has
no
real
power


this
kind
of
government
is
very
rare
today


the
people
do
not
have
a
lot
of
power
in
it

a

a
<collocation>constitutional monarchy</collocation>
is
a
form
of
government
that
is
usually
a
democracy
and
has
a
constitution
with
the
monarch
as
head
of
state


either
the
monarch
has
to
obey
the
laws
like
everyone
else
or
if
the
monarch
does
not
have
to
obey
the
same
laws
as
the
rest
of
the
people
there
are
special
laws
that
say
what
the
monarch
can
and
can
not
do


the
monarch
usually
can
not
decide
their
special
laws
on
their
own


there
may
be
laws
about
who
the
monarch
children
can
marry
for
example
that
are
passed
by
the
parliament
or
congress


for
example
in
the
netherlands
if
a
member
of
the
royal
family
marries
without
the
permission
of
parliament
they
can
not
become
king
or
queen
themselves


the
army
and
navy
may
swear
an
oath
to
the
monarch
but
the
real
power
to
control
it
is
given
to
the
elected
government


there
are
laws
about
property
and
succession
who
gets
to
be
the
next
monarch
that
can
only
be
changed
by
the
elected
government


usually
the
monarch
must
sign
laws
into
effect
but
they
are
required
to
follow
the
will
of
the
elected
government


a
<collocation>constitutional monarchy</collocation>
usually
has
separation
of
power
and
the
monarch
often
has
only
<collocation>ceremonial functions</collocation>
such
as
representing
the
country
while
traveling
or
acting
as
a
symbol
for
the
whole
country
not
for
a
particular
political
party


constitutional
monarchs
usually
do
not
vote
even
when
it
is
legal
for
them
to
do
so


voting
would
mean
that
they
picked
a
side
in
political
arguments
and
then
could
not
claim
to
represent
everyone
in
the
country


some
<collocation>constitutional monarchies</collocation>
give
the
power
to
veto
laws
to
the
monarch
but
in
most
countries
where
this
is
the
case
it
is
a
power
that
is
very
rarely
used


in
countries
where
the
monarch
can
dismiss
or
appoint
governments
this
is
usually
only
done
to
make
sure
that
the
democratic
process
is
respected
without
taking
sides
in
politics


appointments
to
public
office
made
by
constitutional
monarchs
are
generally
approved
by
the
democratically
elected
government
beforehand

north
korea
officially
called
the
democratic
people
republic
of
korea
is
a
country
in
the
northern
part
of
the
korean
peninsula


north
korea
is
next
to
china
russia
and
south
korea


the
capital
city
of
north
korea
is
which
is
also
the
largest
city


the
country
was
founded
in
after
it
had
been
freed
from
japanese
occupation
but
the
southern
half
of
the
country
was
and
remains
occupied
by
the
united
states


at
first
there
was
a
war
between
the
armies
of
the
north
and
south
in
what
is
called
the
korean
war
but
the
fighting
stopped
in
while
the
war
never
officially
ended


afterwards
north
korea
was
friendly
with
china
and
russia
but
never
was
formally
allied
with
either
and
became
more
isolated
over
time


while
the
south
went
from
one
military
dictatorship
to
another
the
north
went
through
steady
development
and
was
ahead
of
the
south
until
the
when
the
south
became
more
democratic


soon
afterwards
the
north
main
<collocation>trading partners</collocation>
collapsed
leaving
it
stranded
and
isolated


throughout
the
north
korea
suffered
from
famines
and
natural
disasters


afterwards
things
stabilized
but
continued
to
lag
behind
the
south


the
country
is
organized
along
socialist
lines
as
all
are
public
property
and
function
along
a
universal
plan


this
is
because
the
founders
of
north
korea
were
inspired
by
the
ideas
of
communism


but
as
time
went
on
north
korea
became
more
conservative
and
nationalist
and
had
less
in
common
with
other
countries
aiming
for
communism


to
justify
these
differences
the
country
leader
kim
said
that
the
government
was
following
his
own
ideology
of
which
means


later
on
the
country
leaders
began
to
remove
communism
from
north
korean
laws
and
philosophy


after
kim
died
during
the
disasters
of
the
his
son
kim
took
his
place
and
was
promoted
by
the
government
as
the
leader
who
led
north
korea
out
of
the
disasters


kim
enacted
a
new
policy
of
or
which
turned
the
country
into
a
military
state


when
he
died
in
his
youngest
son
kim
took
his
place
and
continues
to
lead
the
country
today

north

had
taken
over
much
of

korea
by
force


with
the
help
of
the
other

south
korea
took
back
their
land
and
even
much
of
north
korea
up
to
the
river
which
forms
the
border
between
north
korea
and

china
which
was
also
communist
helped
the
north
koreans
to
get
the
land
back
that
the
south
korean
soldiers
had
taken


after
three
years
in
north
korea
and
south
korea
both
decided
that
no
one
would
win
the
war
and
both
countries
signed
an
armistice
which
is
an
agreement
that
made
both
countries
stop
fighting


north
korea
and
south
korea
were
divided
by
a
demilitarized
zone
which
is
a
special
place
that
surrounds
the
border
between
north
and
south
korea
where
both
countries
can
not
place
lots
of
soldiers
so
that
fighting
does
not
start
again


modern
times
even
though
the
demilitarized
zone
is
meant
to
stop
problems
between
the
two
countries
sometimes
soldiers
on
both
sides
of
the
border
fire
their
guns
at
each
other


a
special
town
in
the
zone
is
called
the
joint
security
area
or
and
sometimes
the
leaders
of
both
countries
meet
there
to
talk
about
possibly
coming
back
together


north
korea
is
one
of
the
few
countries
in
the
world
that
has
made
nuclear
bombs
that
can
kill
many
people
if
it
is
exploded


north
korea
will
not
say
how
many
bombs
it
has
but
other
countries
think
that
the
north
korean
government
probably
has
built
ten
bombs
so
far
out
of
a
deadly
element
called
plutonium


in
october
north
korea
said
that
it
tested
one
of
its
nuclear
bombs


although
the
north
korean
government
said
that
the
test
was
not
dangerous
many
other
countries
and
the
united
nations
were
nonetheless
enraged


three
years
later
in
north
korea
did
another
test
which
broke
a
united
nations
law
called
resolution
which
said
north
korea
could
not
keep
building
and
testing
nuclear
bombs


in
a
south
korean
warship
sank
killing
over
soldiers


an
international
investigation
concluded
that
north
korea
had
sunk
a
south
korean
warship
with
a
torpedo


north
korea
strongly
said
that
it
did
not
have
anything
to
do
with
the
sinking


when
the

states
and
south
korea
planned
to
set
up
defenses
in
case
north
korea
tried
to
attack
again
north
korea
national
<collocation>defense commission</collocation>
threatened
on
to
start
a
war
with
its
nuclear
weapons


in
april
north
korea
launched
a
rocket
called
bright
star


the
reasons
for
the
launch
were
science
and
the
anniversary
of
the
birth
of
the
country
founder
kim


the
government
said
the
rocket
carried
a
weather
satellite
so
the
government
could
find
out
what
the
weather
would
be


however
other
countries
said
that
the
weather
satellite
was
a
story
made
up
by
the
government
so
the
real
purpose
of
the
rocket
would
not
the
known
which
most
countries
thought
was
to
test
a
nuclear
missile
that
could
be
launched
at
the
united
states
or
south
korea


south
korean
leaders
said
it
would
shoot
the
rocket
down
when
it
came
over
south
korea


because
of
this
rocket
other
countries
stopped
helping
north
korea
even
though
the
government
invited
other
countries
to
see
the
<collocation>rocket launch</collocation>
to
make
it
seem
like
the
north
koreans
had
nothing
to
hide
from
other
countries


the
rocket
was
eventually
launched
but
it
did
not
work
and
crashed
just
a
minute
and
thirty
seconds
after
it
was
launched


in
december
the
government
tried
to
launch
the
rocket
again


it
worked
this
time
and
went
into
orbit
circling
the
earth
though
the
united
states
said
that
it
was
very
unstable
and
might
fall
back
to
earth


in
february
north
korea
tested
a
nuclear
bomb
for
the
time
causing
much
outrage
from
other
countries


politics
and
government
north
korea
is
a
communist
country
but
most
countries
in
the
world
say
that
it
is
really
a
totalitarian
<collocation>stalinist dictatorship</collocation>


the

korean
idea


it

army
first

person
is
to

is

chairman
of

national
<collocation>defense commission</collocation>
of
north
korea
which
is
one
of
many
jobs
he
has


he
is
like
a
king
and
can
do
what
he
wants


the
average
north
korean
citizen
makes
around
a
year


kim
makes
around
a
year


he
lives
in
a
palace
and
has
lots
of
soldiers
who
go
wherever
he
does
to
protect
him


korean
people
also
do
not
have
much
freedom
of
speech


people
get
their

from

korean
central

agency
or
which
makes
sure
all
the
country
television
radio
and
newspaper
news
makes
the
government
look
good


this
is
called
propaganda


the
government
blocks
access
to
the
internet
and
it
has
been
found
that
almost
all
north
koreans
do
not
know
what
a
computer
is


the
government
also
tries
to
keep
ideas
from
other
countries
out
of
north
korea


one
north
korean
person
was
put

of
an
agreement
but
the
north
korean
government
said
that
it
was
the
united
states
that
had
broken
the
agreement


it
is
hard
for
people
from
other
countries
to
visit
north
korea


visitors
must
be
guided
by
two
army
members
called
minders
who
try
and
make
sure
the
people
do
not
find
out
about
anything
that
might
make
the
government
look
bad

south
korea
and
north

the
same
set
of
values

divided


since
then
the
government
of
both
north
and
south
korea
were
different


this
has
led
to
different
developments
in
both
north
and
south
korea

of
such
traditional
religions
as
buddhism

confucianism
still
have
an
effect
on
north
korean
spiritual
life


it
seems
that
buddhists
are
accepted
more
than
other
religious
groups


christians
are
said
to
be
persecuted
by
the
authorities


buddhists
are
given
limited
funding
by
the
government
to
promote
the

because
buddhism
played
an
integral
role
in
