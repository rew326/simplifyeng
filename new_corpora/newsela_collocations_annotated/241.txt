he
sees
these
virtues
as
a
way
of
avoiding

ethic


more
virtues
will
lead
to

none
of
them
can
be
forced
on
anyone


some
other
virtues
have
also
been
suggested
humor
empathy
initiative
and
compassion


being
brief
or
being
positive
are
sometimes
claimed
also
to
be
virtues
but
just
as
many
people
think
they
are
bad
things
that
only
help
avoid
truth
or
serious
problems

or
october


jane
had
two
younger
sisters
catherine
and
mary


early
life
jane
parents
were
very
strict
even
by
the
standards
of
the
day


if
she
made
mistakes
in
her
studies
or
had
any
other
normal
troubles
her
mother
would
slap
her
or
beat
her


she
found
she
loved
her
nurse
but
otherwise
lived
a
sad
childhood


she
told
a
visiting
scholar
roger
for
when
i
am
in
the
presence
of
either
father
or
mother
whether
i

when
jane
was
nine
she
was
sent
to
the
royal
court
to
learn
etiquette
and
manners
with
henry
sixth
wife
and
<collocation>eventual widow</collocation>
<collocation>catherine parr</collocation>


jane
liked
catherine
a
great
deal
and
found
love
with
her
which
she
had
not
got
from
her
parents


it
was
clear
that
catherine
was
very
fond
of
jane
in
return


jane
also
found
friendship
with
her
cousin
and
future
king
edward
vi


they
often
studied
together


jane
was
well
educated
as
a
child
and
learned
to
read
in
latin
greek
french
and
italian
as
well
as
english


later
in
her
life
she
also
learned
hebrew


parents
<collocation>political ambitions</collocation>
jane
parents
especially
her
mother
wanted
to
gain
more
political
influence


for
that
reason
they
wanted
to
marry
her
to
someone
important


jane
had
two
sisters
catherine
born
in
and
mary
born
in


after
her
sisters
were
born
her
parents
tried
to
marry
jane
to
her
cousin
edward
vi


they
went
to
<collocation>catherine parr</collocation>
new
husband
thomas
to
try
to
prepare
this
royal
marriage


it
is
likely
that
king
edward
loved
jane


however
he
decided
to
arrange
a
marriage
with
a
foreign
princess
instead


in
jane
was
sent
to
to
be
with
<collocation>catherine parr</collocation>
and
thomas


<collocation>catherine parr</collocation>
became
pregnant
that
same
year
and
the
family
moved
to
castle
in
june
taking
jane
with
them


tragedy
struck
when
<collocation>catherine parr</collocation>
died
while
having
the
baby
in
august
of
that
year
and
jane
served
as
chief
mourner
in
her
funeral


jane
was
dealt
another
blow
in
when
thomas
was
arrested
on
charges
of
treason


she
was
sent
back
to
her
angered
parents


they
knew
that
their
hopes
of
her
marriage
to
the
king
were
ruined
they
punished
her
cruelly
for
this
even
though
it
was
not
her
fault


youth
in
jane
mother
two
died
of
the
sweating
sickness


since
frances
father
was
dead
she
became
duchess
of
suffolk


jane
father
also
became
duke
of
suffolk


in
the
same
year
john
dudley
was
made
the
duke
of
and
the
<collocation>chief councillor</collocation>
to
edward
vi


john
dudley
plot
in
april
edward
became
sick
with
the
measles
and
caught
tuberculosis
as
well


by
next
year
edward
was
so
ill
that
he
was
weak
and
spitting
up
blood
or
something
that
was


it
was
clear
that
he
was
going
to
die
soon


dudley
knew
that
if
either
of
edward
mary
or
elizabeth
became
queen
he
would
not
be
powerful
anymore


dudley
plotted
with
jane
equally
ambitious
parents
and
planned
that
jane
became
his
ward
and
also
that
she
marry
his
son
dudley


jane
mother
decided
to
give
up
her
claim
to
be
queen
for
jane


this
did
not
mean
that
frances
was
any
less
greedy
however


this
meant
that
jane
would
become
frances
and
dudley
puppet
and
do
what
they
wanted


now
jane
would
be
the
next
in
line
to
the
throne
if
the
rights
of
the
princesses
mary
and
elizabeth
were
ignored


marriage
when
jane
mother
and
father
told
her
that
jane
was
going
to
get
married
jane
refused


she
said
that
was
ugly
stupid
and
rude


she
also
hated
john
dudley


when
jane
refused
frances
and
henry
swore
at
jane
and
slapped
her


this
did
not
work
so
frances
gave
jane
a
brutal
whipping


finally
jane
agreed


the
wedding
between
jane
and
happened
on
may


this
became
a
triple
marriage
because
jane
sister
katherine
was
married
at
this
time
to
lord
herbert
and
sister
katherine
was
also
married
to
lord
hastings


accession
on
july
king
edward
vi
died


dudley
plan
to
make
jane
queen
was
starting
to
take
place


edward
death
was
kept
secret
for
a
few
days
until
jane
could
be
proclaimed
queen
