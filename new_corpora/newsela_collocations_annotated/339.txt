three

dog
named
cerberus
who
guarded

kingdom


pluto
was
also
the
god
of
wealth
because
diamonds
and
other
jewels
come
from

a
myth
about
pluto
is
that
he
took
who
was
the
daughter
of
ceres
to
the
underworld
to
be
his
wife


ceres
cried
and
did
not
let
plants
grow
on
the
earth


people
needed
the
plants
so
much
that
the
god
jupiter
made
pluto
give
her
up


the
deal
they
worked
out
was
that
for
six
months
pluto
got


while
was
in
the
underworld
no
plants
could
grow
on
earth
and
it
was
winter


when
could
go
back
to
her
mother
it
was
summer


this
was
how
the
greeks
explained
the
seasons

temporary

with
ussr
occupying

this
was
at
first
to

for
a
short
time


at
the
moscow
conference
of
the
council
of
foreign
ministers
in
december
the

and
ussr
agreed
on
korea
having
a
provisional
government
a
temporary
government
set
up
quickly
before
a
real
government
is
ready


this
became
difficult
because
of
the
growing
cold
war
see
next
cause


the
cold
war
was
an
important
cause
in
the
korean
war


relations
between
the
two
occupying
powers
were
bad
and
when
china
became
communist
in
october
the
president
of
the
usa
harry
truman
was
very
worried
that
other
countries
around
china
may
also
become
communist
such
as
japan


the
american
army
was
about

twelfth

push
them
past
the
border
separating
north

south
korea
and
close
to
the
chinese
border
just
south
of
the

china
starts
to
feel
threatened
with
the
war
happening
so
close
to
them
and
tells
the
un
army
and
the
south
korean
army
to
return
to

and
that
they
have
no
