movies
can
be
fictional
made
up
or
true
or
a
mix
of
the
two


although
hundreds
of
movies
are
made
every
year
there
are
very
few
that
do
not
follow
a
small
number
of
set
plots
or
stories


some
movies
mix
together
two
or
more
genres


action
movies
have
a
lot
of
exciting
effects
like
car
chases
and
gun
fights
involving
stuntmen


they
usually
involve
goodies
and
baddies
so
war
and
crime
are
common
subjects


action
movies
usually
need
very
little
effort
to
watch
since
the
plot
is
normally
simple


for
example
in
die
hard
terrorists
take
control
of
a
skyscraper
and
ask
for
a
big
ransom
in
exchange
for
not
killing
the
hostage
workers


one
hero
somehow
manages
to
save
everyone


action
movies
do
not
usually
make
people
cry
but
if
the
action
movie
is
also
a
drama
emotion
will
be
involved


adventure
movies
usually
involve
a
hero
who
sets
out
on
a
quest
to
save
the
world
or
loved
ones


animated
movies
use
artificial
images
like
talking
pigs
to
tell
a
story


these
movies
used
to
be
drawn
by
hand
one
frame
at
a
time
but
are
now
made
on
computers


buddy
movies
involve
heroes
one
must
save
the
other
both
must
overcome
obstacles


buddy
movies
often
involve
comedy
but
there
is
also
some
emotion
because
of
the
close
friendship
between
the
buddies


comedies
are
funny
movies
about
people
being
silly
or
doing
unusual
things
that
make
the
<collocation>audience laugh</collocation>


documentaries
are
movies
that
are
or
claim
to
be
about
real
people
and
real
events


they
are
nearly
always
serious
and
may
involve
strongly
emotional
subjects
for
example
cruelty


dramas
are
serious
and
often
about
people
falling
in
love
or
needing
to
make
a
big
decision
in
their
life


they
tell
stories
about
relationships
between
people


they
usually
follow
a
basic
plot
where
one
or
two
main
characters
each
actor
plays
a
character
have
to
overcome
get
past
an
obstacle
the
thing
stopping
them
to
get
what
they
want


tragedies
are
always
dramas
and
are
about
people
in
trouble


for
example
a
husband
and
wife
who
are
divorcing
must
each
try
to
prove
to
a
court
of
law
that
they
are
the
best
person
to
take
care
of
their
child


emotion
feelings
are
a
big
part
of
the
movie
and
the
audience
people
watching
the
movie
may
get
upset
and
even
cry


<collocation>film noir</collocation>
movies
are
detective
dramas
about
crime
and
violence


family
movies
are
made
to
be
good
for
the
entire
family


they
are
mainly
made
for
children
but
often
entertaining
for
adults
as
well


disney
is
famous
for
their
family
movies


horror
movie

fear
to
excite
the
audience


music
lighting
and
sets
places
in
movie
studios
where
the
movie
is
made
are
all
designed
to
add
to
the
feeling


<collocation>romantic comedies</collocation>
are
usually
love
stories
about
people
from
different
worlds
who
must
overcome
obstacles
to
be
together


are
always
but
may
include
some
emotion


science
fiction
movies
are
set
in
the
future
or
in
outer
space


some
use
their
future
or
alien
settings
to
ask
questions
about
the
meaning
of
life
or
how
we
should
think
about
life


science
fiction
movies
often
use
special
effects
to
create
images
of
alien
worlds
outer
space
<collocation>alien creatures</collocation>
and
spaceships


thrillers
are
usually
about
a
mystery
strange
event
or
crime
that
needs
to
be
solved


the
audience
is
kept
guessing
until
the
final
minutes

usually
twists
in
the
plot
surprises


western
movies
tell
stories
about
cowboys
in
the
western
united
states
in
the


they
are
usually
really

or
may
not

on
the
edge
of
your
seat

the
business
of
making
movies
movies
can
make
profits
in
the
hundreds
of
millions
be
they
dollars
euro
or
pounds


in
india
movies
have
become
an
enormous
part
of
the
economy


the
industry
has
always
been
dominated
by
quite
a
small
number
of
major
studios
like
warner
columbia
or
paramount


there
are
many
large
companies
that
provide
all
of
the
services
needed
to
make
movies
such
as
special
effects
lighting
set
building


many
of
these
employees
belong
to
<collocation>trade unions</collocation>
who
say
how
much
their
members
must
be
paid


a
huge
number
of
smaller
companies
also
offer
services
such
as
music
studios
which
record
the
music
for
original
movie
sound
tracks
and
computer
animation


finally
there
are
movie
distribution
companies
which
send
movies
around
the
world
or
around
a
country
and
advertising
companies
who
let
people
know
about
the
movie
and
promote
it
try
to
make
people
want
to
see
the
movie


movies
with
famous
stars
and
large
budgets
lots
of
money
are
designed
to
have
a
wide
appeal
so
that
hopefully
millions
of
people
will
pay
to
see
them


movies
like
this
which
always
cost
the
most
to
make
are
called
blockbusters


special
effects
can
add
a
huge
amount
to
the
cost
of
a
movie
especially
the
newest
effects
but
people
have
come
to
expect
them
and
every
blockbuster
movie
tries
to
the
last


even
in
some
movies
cost
up
to
million
to
make


very
successful
movies
can
make
many
times
that
amount
in
profit
and
that
why
the
studios
keep
producing
them


this
kind
of
movie
will
have
a
lot
of
promotion
through
television
advertising
billboards
and
internet
sites


in
blockbuster
movies
there
is
usually
a
happy
ending
in
which
all
of
the
problems
in
the
plot
story
are
figured
out
or
fixed
and
almost
everyone
except
the
baddie
live
happily
ever
after


some
movies
have
been
so
successful
that
the
studios
keep
releasing
more
and
more
sequels
or
movies
with
the
same
characters
and
basic
plots


at
the
opposite
end
of
the
scale
to
the
blockbuster
there
is
the
independent
art
or
indie
movie


these
are
usually
made
by
small
movie
companies
or
even
just
a
small
group
of
people
that
do
not
have
much
money


an
example
is
the
blair
witch
project
which
cost
only
about
but
which
has
so
far
taken
perhaps
million
in
ticket
and
sales


movies
like
this
are
very
unusual
and
usually
become
popular
underground
people
tell
each
other
about
it
so
that
they
become
cult
or
popular
but
not
mainstream


independent
movies
often
tell
more
creative
or
unusual
strange
stories
or
may
have
sad
endings
that
do
not
appeal
to
the
big
studios
because
they
can
not
be
sure
how
the
public
will
react
to
them


they
rarely
make
a
lot
of
money
but
if
they
are
successful
the
big
studios
will
quickly
try
to
get
the
people
involved
to
sign
a
contract
with
them
by
offering
them
a
lot
of
money
to
make
another
movie


it
is
often
the
case
that
the
new
movie
with
its
big
budget
and
its
stars
will
be
less
successful
than
the
first

holland
is
the
name
of
a
region
in
the
western
part
of
the
netherlands


holland
was
a
county
of
the
holy
roman
empire
and
later
the
leading
province
of
the
republic
of
the
seven
united
netherlands


today
there
are
two
provinces
called
holland
in
the
netherlands
north
holland
and
south
holland


those
provinces
were
created
in


the
earlier
country
and
province
of
holland
used
to
be
greater
but
some
parts
were
given
to
other
provinces
during
the
french
occupation


became
part
of
north
the
islands
of
and
were
given
to
and
the
island
of
to


many
people
inside
and
outside
the
netherlands
use
the
name
holland
to
refer
to
the
entire
netherlands
but
that
is
not
correct
and
is
like
calling
the
<collocation>united kingdom</collocation>
england


some
dutch
people
who
do
not
live
in
holland
do
not
like
it
when
people
call
the
entire
country
holland


for
a
short
time
there
was
a
kingdom
of
holland
which
was
in
central
and
northern
netherlands
and
east
in
germany


holland
is
also
the
name
of
a
region
in
england


the
atoms
of
a
<collocation>chemical element</collocation>
can
exist
in
different
types


these
are
called
isotopes


they
have
the
same
number
of
protons
and
electrons
but
different
numbers
of
neutrons


different
isotopes
of
the
same
element
have
different
masses


mass
is
the
word
for
how
much
substance
or
matter
something
has


things
with
different
masses
have
different
weights


because
different
isotopes
have
different
numbers
of
neutrons
they
do
not
all
weigh
the
same
or
have
the
same
mass


different
isotopes
of
the
same
element
have
the
same
atomic
number


they
have
the
same
number
of
protons


the
atomic
number
is
decided
by
the
number
of
protons


isotopes
have
different
mass
numbers
though
because
they
have
different
numbers
of
neutrons


the
word
isotope
meaning
at
the
same
place
comes
from
the
fact
that
isotopes
are
at
the
same
place
on
the
<collocation>periodic table</collocation>


in
a
neutral
atom
the
number
of
electrons
equals
the
number
of
protons


isotopes
of
the
same
element
also
have
the
same
number
of
electrons
and
the
electronic
structure


because
how
an
atom
acts
is
decided
by
its
electronic
structure
isotopes
are
almost
the
same
chemically
but
different
physically
to
their
original
atoms


heavier
isotopes
react
slower
than
lighter
isotopes
of
the
same
element


this
mass
effect
is
large
for
h
and
deuterium
h
because
deuterium
has
twice
the
mass
of


for
heavier
elements
the
relative
atomic
weight
difference
between
isotopes
is
much
less
and
the
mass
effect
is
usually
small


atomic
nuclei
are
protons
and
neutrons
held
together
by
the
strong
nuclear
force


because
protons
have
a
positive
charge
they
push
against
other
protons


neutrons
are
electrically
neutral
and
they
attract
the
protons
more
than
the
protons
push
against
other
protons


this
makes
the
nucleus
more
stable


so
we
need
neutrons
for
more
than
two
protons
to
be
in
a
nucleus


as
there
are
more
protons
more
neutrons
are
needed
to
have
a
stable
nucleus


but
if
there
are
too
many
neutrons
the
nucleus
becomes
unstable


in
nature
some
elements
only
have
a
single
isotope


for
example
fluorine
f
is
the
only
isotope
of
fluorine


other
elements
have
many
isotopes


for
example
xenon
has
isotopes


some
isotopes
are
radioactive


these
are
called
radioactive
isotopes


others
are
not
radioactive


these
are
called
stable
isotopes


hydrogen
has
three
common
isotopes


the
most
common
isotope
of
hydrogen
is
called
h


a
hydrogen
atom
with
an
extra
neutron
atomic
mass
of
is
called
deuterium
h


hydrogen
with
one
proton
and
two
neutrons
atomic
mass
of
is
called
tritium
h


and
deuterium
are
stable
isotopes
while
tritium
is
a
<collocation>radioactive isotope</collocation>


the
heaviest
elements
in
the
<collocation>periodic table</collocation>
are
all
radioactive


all
of
the
isotopes
of
radon
thorium
and
uranium
are
radioactive
since
they
are
very
heavy


this
is
because
the
nuclear
forces
inside
the
nucleus
of
the
atom
have
a
tough
time
holding
together
all
the
particles
with
so
many

at

witnesses
looked

if

denied

could
often
see
the
deaths
this
was
the
rulers
warning
not
to
commit
a
crime


many
of
the
elephants
were
very
large
weighing
more
than
nine
tons


rulers
wanted
crushing
by
elephant
to
be
bloody
and
gross


some
rulers
in

condemned
children
too


many
rulers
in

asia
used
elephants
as
executioners
ones
who
put

emperor
used
his

as

too


ruled

he
put

the
huge
elephant
crushed
most
but
sometimes
refused


believed
this
proved
their
innocence
and
then
released
them


different
regions
crushed
people
by
elephant
in
different
ways


one
region
put
people
inside
of
a
bag
so
they
would
not
have
to
watch
what
was
about
to
happen


then
the
elephant
would
crush
the
bag
flat
with
the

inside


in
another
region
people
made
the
condemned
watch
the
elephant
slowly
come
from
far
away


its
huge
feet
kept
coming
closer


sometimes
they
buried
the
condemned
to
the
neck


the
elephant
would
come
and
step
on
the
head


some
places
made
the
condemned
put
his
head
on
a
special
stand


the
stand
had
fountains
on
the
sides
where
brains
and
blood
would
flow
when
the
elephant
pressed
down
its
huge
foot


military
use
for
hundreds
of
years
people
used
elephants
for
military
purposes


death
under
the
foot
of
an
elephant
was
common
for
people
who
left
the
army
or
prisoners
as
well
as
for
military
criminals


history
in
writing
there
are
few
records
about
crushing
by
elephant


many
records
were
lost


the
british
wrote
many
things
about
it
during
their
long
rule
of
india


the
british
used
crushing
by
elephant
even
into
the
century


they
used
it
to
terrify
and
because
the
indians
had
used
it
before
them


when
the
british
took
over
a
state
they
liked
to
use
local
ways
of
doing
things

obvious
example


it
is
typically
much
larger
than
a
social
network
but
is
not
one
since
people
can
only
call
on
each
other
for
a
small
number
of
reasons
and
perhaps
at
specific
times


also
not
every
member
of
the
network
has
the
same
role
or
right
to
help


a
corporation
may
also
be
a
power
network
if
it
relies
on
many
power
relations
to
maintain
itself
for
instance
the
right
to
draw
oil
from
the
ground
or
<collocation>dump waste</collocation>
without
being
held
responsible
for
it


when
a
power
network
achieves
some
<collocation>stable grasp</collocation>
of
political
power
and
daily
working
control
of
some
important
infrastructure
it
becomes
a
power
structure


in
a
democracy
the
visible
power
networks
represented
by
the
parties
compete
regularly
in
an
election
but
much
of
the
power
structure
typically
the
bureaucracy
does
not
change
and
is
typically
ignored
as
a
power

citizenship
is
the
relationship
between
a
person
and
his
or
her
country
usually
the
same
one
he
or
she
lives
in
supports
and
in
return
gets
protection
from


a
person
is
usually
a
citizen
of
the
country
where
he
or
she
is
born
but
sometimes
a
person
will
apply
to
change
his
or
her
citizenship
to
become
a
citizen
in
another
country


in
most
countries
citizens
have
rights
sometimes
called
civil
rights
such
as
political
participation
at
a
lawful
age
and
duties
such
as
keeping
the
laws


some
have
made
a
difference
between
a
citizen
living
in
a
republic
a
country
with
no
monarch
and
a
subject
who
is
under
the
rule
of
a
king
or
queen
such
as
sweden


definitions
a
citizen
is
a
member
of
a
group
membership
of
sovereign
people
that
have
certain
rights
who
consent
to
form
and
maintain
a
government
that
can
protect
these
rights
or
take
advantage
of
them


some
governments
can
admit
and
exile
people
from
this
citizenship
in
order
to
these


people
born
in
the
country
may
be
citizens
by
jus
right
of
soil


those
having
citizen
parents
may
be
natural
born
citizens


some
countries
also
recognize
jus
the
right
of
members
of
the
national
diaspora
to
be
citizens


foreigners
can
also
be
naturalized
as
citizens


naturalization
makes
them
citizens
of
their
new
country


usually
they
give
up
their
citizenship
of
their
old
country


people
who
consent
to
belong
to
more
than
one
government
with
approval
of
both
government
are
dual
citizens
as
are


people
who
consent
to
one
government
but
move
and
reside
to
another
government
with
approval
of
both
governments


people

belong
to
