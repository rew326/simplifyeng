governor
was
the
governor
of
new
south
wales
and
one
who
though
that
australia
could
be
a
rich
and
free
place


because
australia
is
such
a
very
large
land
it
was
easy
to
think
that
it
might
be
able
to
hold
a
very
large
number
of
people


in
the
early
days
of
the
colony
a
great
number
of
explorers
went
out
searching
for
good
land
to
settle
on


when
the
settlers
looked
west
from
sydney
they
saw
a
range
of
mountains
which
they
called
the
blue
mountains


they
were
not
very
high
and
did
not
look
very
rugged
but
for
many
years
could
find
their
way
through
them


in
gregory
william

a
called
william
charles
crossed
the
blue
mountains
and
found
land
on
the

good
for
farming


a
road
was
built
and
the
governor
founded
the
town
of

the
other

miles
from
sydney


some
people
like
captain
charles
were
sure
that
there
must
be
a
sea
in
the
middle
of
australia
and
set
out
to
find
it


many
of
the
explorers
did
not
prepare

went
out

the
hottest
time
of
year


some
died
like
burke
and
wills


ludwig
got
lost
twice


the

one
of
the
most
successful
explorers


he
mapped
the
country
as
he
went
and
his
maps
remained
in
use
for
more
than
years


he
traveled
all
the
way
to
what
is
now
western
victoria
and
to
his
surprise
and
annoyance
found
that
he
was
not

not
be
told
what
to
do
from
london


the
first
governments
in

english
base
