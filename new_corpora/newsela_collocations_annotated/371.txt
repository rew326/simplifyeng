diversity
around
genera
and
species
of
the
bamboo
is
a
name
for
more
than
one
thousand
species
of
giant
grasses


there
are
about
different
genera


all
bamboos
have
wood
like
stems


bamboo
mainly
grows
in
africa
america
and
in
asia
but
can
easily
grow
in
europe


bamboo
grows
in
clumps
although
running
varieties
exist


and
can
be
up
to
metres
feet


david
in
his
book
the
book
of
bamboo
says
that
bamboo
has
been
measured
to
grow
meter
inches
in
a
period


however
most
bamboos
used
for
gardening
will
grow
more
like
cm
to
cm
inches
a
day


almost
all
species
of
bamboo
have
hollow
stems
divided
into
nodes
or
joints


the
stem
can
be
up
to
cm
a
foot
in
diameter


each
of
the
node
has
one
side
bud


not
all
of
those
buds
develop
into
branches
but
some
do


this
makes
bamboo
one
of
the
few
grasses
that
have
a
branch
structure


bamboo
rarely
flowers


some
species
only
flower
once
and
then
die
off


the
distance
of
two
joints
in
a
bamboo
is
the
basis
of
a
traditional
japanese
unit
of
measurement


uses
bamboo
is
used
to
make
lots
of
things
and
is
a
construction
material


the
stems
of
larger
trees
are
used
to
build
houses
bridges
and
other
things
that
have
to
be
constructed
such
as
boat
and


it
can
be
used
for
scaffolding


bamboo
is
an
easy
construction
material
that
is
not
too
expensive


<collocation>bamboo shoots</collocation>
can
also
be
used
as
human
food


<collocation>bamboo shoots</collocation>
new
bamboo
that
come
out
of
the
ground
are
usually
cooked
before
being
eaten


most
temperate
bamboos
can
be
eaten
without
cooking
if
they
are
not
too
bitter


as
some
may
contain
cooking
is
better

mythic
origin
of
the
war
the
origins
of
the
war
in
the
iliad
started
at
the
wedding
of
king
and
the
thetis


they
had
invited
almost
all
the
gods
to
their
wedding


but
they
did
not
invite
eris
goddess
of
strife


she
was
angry
and
she
threw
a
golden
apple
among
the
guests
on
which
was
written
to
the
fairest


the
goddesses
hera
athena
and
aphrodite
caught
the
apple
at
the
same
time
and
fought
over
who
was
the
most
beautiful


because
they
could
not
end
the
fight
by
themselves
they
went
to
zeus
the
king
of
the
gods


zeus
chose
paris
to
decide
and
give
the
apple
to
who
he
wanted


each
of
the
three
goddesses
offered
paris
gifts
so
he
would
choose
her


hera
offered
paris
all
of
asia


athena
offered
him
wisdom


then
aphrodite
offered
him
the
love
of
the
most
beautiful
woman


paris
gave
the
apple
to
aphrodite


of
course
aphrodite
had
not
thought
about
the
fact
that
the
most
beautiful
woman
helen
queen
of
sparta
already
had
a
husband
king
menelaus
of
sparta


but
aphrodite
had
her
son
eros
shoot
helen
with
a
golden
arrow
and
fall
in
love
with
paris


then
the
pair
left
for
troy


menelaus
helen
husband
declared
war
on
troy
to
retrieve
his
queen


this
began
the
trojan
war


the
<collocation>trojan horse</collocation>
the
war
went
on
for
ten
years


some
famous
fighters
were
achilles
paris
and
hector


the
greeks
won
by
building
a
big
wooden
horse


this
became
named
the
<collocation>trojan horse</collocation>


some
greek
soldiers
hid
inside
the
horse
and
the
rest
put
the
horse
on
the
shore
and
left
in
their
boats


the
trojans
saw
the
horse
and
thought
that
the
greeks
had
surrendered
stopped
trying
to
win
the
war


they
thought
the
horse
was
a
present


they
dragged
the
horse
into
troy
and
celebrated
their
victory


when
night
fell
the
greeks
hiding
inside
the
horse
opened
the
city
gates
and
set
fire
to
the
houses


the
greeks
who
had
left
in
their
boats
had
just
pretended
to
leave
to
trick
the
trojans


they
returned
and
won
the
war


the
trick
was
thought
up
by
odysseus
or
ulysses
as
he
was
also
known
king
of
the
small
island
of


what
really
happened
the
<collocation>hittite empire</collocation>
about
is
in

the
city
called
is
probably
troy


the
war
probably
did
happen
but
in
the
telling
the
events
were
exaggerated
and
<collocation>mythic elements</collocation>
were
added


these
changes
fit
the
needs
of
oral
poetry


in
the
century
the
german
archaeologist
discovered
the
ruins
of
a
city
which
he
identified
as
troy


some
hittite
and
egyptian
texts

talk
about
the
war

say
that
a
confederation
of
cities
went
to
war
