whales
are
large
<collocation>marine mammals</collocation>
which
live
in
the
ocean


like
other
mammals
they
breathe
oxygen
from
the
air
have
a
small
amount
of
hair
and
are
warm
blooded


there
are
two
basic
kinds
of
whales
and
about
species


people
use
the
word
whale
in
different
ways


some
use
it
for
all
cetaceans
including
dolphins
and
porpoises


these
people
say
that
dolphins
and
porpoises
were
also
whales
because
they
are
also
cetaceans


others
separate
out
the
dolphins
and
porpoises
common
people
have
never
called
them
or
thought
of
them
as
whales
unless
they
are
very
large


actually
there
is
no
clear
line
between
whales
and
dolphins


whales
have
been
killed
for
meat
and
oil
by
whalers


however
many
countries
have
laws
saying
not
to
kill
whales
anymore


some
countries
such
as
iceland
and
japan
do
not
have
these
laws


in
other
countries
such
as
the
usa
only
eskimos
and
some
american
indians
may
legally
kill
whales

clouds
of
very
small
things
floating
in

water
and
krill


the
whales
mouths
are
very
large


they
open
their
mouths
very
wide
and
hold
a
big
mouthful
of
sea
water


their
throats
stretch
very
wide
to
make
the
space
inside
their
mouth
even
bigger


then
they
close
their
mouth
and
squeeze
out
the
seawater


the
food
does
not
escape
because
instead
of
teeth
these
whales
have
filters
called
baleen


baleen
is
long
hard
strips
that
act
like
a
strainer


the
water
goes
through
the
baleen


animals
and
plants
in
the
water
are
trapped
and
swallowed
while
the
water
goes
back
out


this
is
very
different
from
the
way
that
whales
eat


whales
eat
larger
fish
<collocation>or meat</collocation>
and
are
like
big
dolphins


they
have
sharp
teeth
and
usually
have
a
big
forehead


inside
the
big
forehead
is
a
chamber
to
make
and
direct
sounds


they
make
all
kinds
of
sounds
including
sounds
so
loud
they
can
shock
fish


they
can
use
echolocation
to
locate
things
that
they
can
not
see


some
whales
such
as
the
<collocation>sperm whale</collocation>
are
almost
never
called
dolphins


some
of
them
are
always
called
dolphins


others
are
like
dolphins
in
some
ways
and
like
whales
in
others


cetaceans
are
divided
into
two
the
largest
<collocation>baleen whales</collocation>
are
characterized
by
baleen
a
structure
in
the
upper
jaw
made
of
keratin
which
it
uses
to
filter
plankton
from
the
water


whales
bear
sharp
teeth
for
hunting


also
include
dolphins
and
porpoises


both
cetaceans
and
are
now
classified
under
the
which
includes
both
whales
and
hippopotamuses


whales
are
the
hippopotamus
closest
living
relatives


evolution
all
cetaceans
including
whales
dolphins
and
porpoises
are
descendants
of
mammals
of
the
order


both
are
related
to
an
extinct
from
which
they
split
around
million
<collocation>years ago</collocation>


primitive
whales
probably
first
took
to
the
sea
about
million
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
and
became
fully
aquatic
about
million
years
later


is
an
important
transitional
species


physiology
because
of
where
they
live
and
unlike
many
animals
whales
are
conscious
breathers
they
decide
when
to
breathe


whales
breathe
through


<collocation>baleen whales</collocation>
have
two
and
whales
have
one


these
are
on
the
top
of
the
head
the
<collocation>animal breathes</collocation>
while
most
of
their
body
is
underwater


breathing
first
shoots
out
extra
water
from
the
blowhole
making
a
jet
into
the
air
followed
by
inhaling
air
into
the
lungs


all
mammals
sleep
including
whales
but
they
can
not
stay
in
an
unconscious
state
for
too
long
because
they
need
to
be
conscious
to
breathe


it
is
thought
that
only
one
hemisphere
half
of
their
brains
sleeps
at
a
time
so
that
whales
are
never
completely
asleep
but
still
get
the
rest
they
need


whales
are
thought
to
sleep
around
eight
hours
a
day


reproduction
a
single
calf
is
born
every
two
or
three
years


gestation
takes
up
to
a
year


nursing
continues
for
more
than
a
year
in
many
species
there
is
a
strong
bond
between
mother
and
calf


reproductive
maturity
occurs
at
seven
to
ten
years


this
mode
of
reproduction
produces
few
offspring
but
increases
their
chance
of
surviving


the
effect
of
hunting
is
severe
on
these
animals
who
replace
their
numbers
so
slowly


whale
behavior
socialization
whales
are
known
to
teach
learn
cooperate
scheme
and
even
grieve


breaching
breaching
is
what
happens
when
a
<collocation>whale jumps</collocation>
into
the
air
and
then
purposefully
flops
down
on
the
water
with
a
great
splash


sometimes
it
twirls
in
the
air
when
it
does
this


scientists
are
not
sure
whether
breaching
is
done
to
play
to
clean
the
whale
skin
of
things
that
are
stuck
to
it
or
to
tell
other
whales
something


there
are
a
number
of
other
behaviors
on
the
surface
which
are
not
well
understood


logging
is
when
a
whale
swims
slowly
at
the
surface
of
the
ocean
with
very
little
movement


when
a
whale
does
this
it
looks
like
a
log
in
the
water


some
scientists
think
this
is
a
kind
of
rest
or
sleep
for
whales


is
when
a
whale
sits
straight
up
in
the
water
with
its
head
straight
up
and
out
of
the
water


it
will
sometimes
turn
around
in
circles
as
it


some
scientists
think
this
might
be
because
whales
are
trying
to
see
what
is
happening
above
water


is
done
when
a
whale
faces
downward
in
the
water


it
then
slaps
the
water
with
a
<collocation>thunderous sound</collocation>


scientists
think
this
might
be
done
to
warn
other
whales
of
danger
or
as
a
method
of
feeding

a
marker
is
a
writing
device
that
allows

or
scribble


ink
comes
out
of
the
tip
of
the
marker
and
onto
the
writing
surface
commonly
a
piece
of
paper


markers
generally
come
in
a
variety
of
different
colors


they
are
sometimes
referred
to
as
<collocation>magic markers</collocation>
or
magic
pens


the
tip
of
the
marker
where
ink
comes
out
from
is
usually
made
of
cloth


this
allows
the
ink
to
go

old
type
of
anchor
commons
anchors
are
used
to
stop
boats
from
moving


today
anchors
are
usually
made
of
metal
and
they
are
made
to
catch
the
ocean
floor
the
seabed


there
are
two
main
types
of
anchors
temporary
and
permanent


a
permanent
anchor
is
called
a
mooring
block
and
is
not
easily
moved


a
temporary
anchor
can
be
moved
and
is
carried
on
the
boat


when
people
talk
about
anchors
they
are
usually
thinking
about
<collocation>temporary anchors</collocation>


an
anchor
works
by
either
weight
mass
or
shape


shape
is
more
important
to
<collocation>temporary anchors</collocation>
and
design
is
very
important


anchors
must
resist
wind
and
tide
and
also
the
movement
of
waves

history
the
oldest
anchors
were
just
rocks
and
many
rock
anchors
have
been
found
from
a
long
time
ago


many
modern
moorings
still
use
a
large
rock
as
the
mooring
block


a
simple
anchor
which
uses
two
arms
made
of
wood
and
a
rock
weight
is
an
anchor
which
is
still
used
today


the
wood
arms
are
sharp
to
enter
the
seabed
and
the
weight
will
hold
normal
movement


designs
of
<collocation>temporary anchors</collocation>
the
english
language
uses
several
special
words
to
describe
parts
of
anchors


this
is
because
england
has
a
rich
marine
and
naval
history
and
so
the
language
gives
a
large
number
of
words
to
boat
and
ship
terminology


a
modern
temporary
anchor
usually
has
a
middle
bar
called
the
shank
attached
to
a
flat
surface
traditionally
called
fluke
which
holds
the
seabed


the
place
where
the
shank
meets
the
fluke
is
called
the
crown
and
the
shank
is
usually
fitted
with
a
ring
or
shackle
to
attach
it
to
the
rode
cable
chain
or
rope
joining
the
anchor
to
the
boat


some
old
anchors
have
attached
to
the
shank
a
stock
which
is
a
bar
that
places
the
anchor
in
a
certain
way
when
it
falls
on
the
seabed


old
anchors
are
often
named
stocked
or
anchors
depending
on
whether
they
have
this
or
not


there
are
many
designs


hook
designs
use
small
flukes
with
a
heavy
narrow
to
go
deeply
into
difficult


plow
also
spelled
plough
bury
themselves
in
the
bottom
as
force
is
applied
to
them


they
look
and
work
like
a
farmer
plow


the
first
was
the
first
made
in
in
the
<collocation>united kingdom</collocation>


they
do
not
hold
as
well
as
modern
anchors


fluke
or
plate
designs
use
large
flukes
to
develop
good
holding


they
hold
well
but
are
difficult
to
make
set
go
into
the
seabed


over
the
last
years
many
new
anchor
designs
have
appeared


these
anchors
are
usually
designed
for
small
vessels
and
are
usually
not
for
large
ships


see
modern
designs


fisherman
the
fisherman
has
a
traditional
design
that
has
not
changed
much
over
time


it
is
less
useful
than
a
good
modern
design
and
its
holding
power
for
its
weight
is
among
the
worst
of
all
anchor
types


a
<collocation>anchor fluke</collocation>
the
most
common
type
of
<collocation>fluke anchors</collocation>
is
the


the
style
uses
a
stock
at
the
crown
see
above
to
which
two
large
flat
flukes
are
attached


the
stock
can
rotate
so
the
flukes
can
move
toward
the
bottom


it
can
hold
very
well
but
has
difficulty
setting
entering
the
seabed
on
its
own


it
is
efficient
for
its
weight


<collocation>fluke anchors</collocation>
have
difficulty
penetrating
kelp
and
weed
as
well
as
very
hard
sand
or
clay


once
set
the
anchor
can
come
free
and
fail
to
reset
on
its
own


a
traditional
design
the
style
is
simple
to
design
and
build


it
is
a
simple
hook
that
is
good
for
rock
or
reefs


it
is
useless
for
most
other

now
exist


plows
used
to
be
popular
with
sailors
and
private
boaters


they
are
good
but
not
excellent
in
most


another
more
recent
design
is
the
delta
which
is
better


plows
use
a
special
weight
in
the
tip
of
the
fluke
the

for
them
to
