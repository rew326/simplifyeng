final

one

photographs
of
lenin
after
a
woman
named
shot
lenin
in
he
started
having
strokes
in
may
and
december
both
of
which
he
recovered
from
in
march
which
paralyzed
him
and
left
him
unable
to
speak
and
in
january
which
killed
him


just
before
he
died
lenin
had
wanted
to
get
rid
of
stalin
because
he
thought
he
was
dangerous
to
the
country
and
the
government


after
his
death
the
city
of
petersburg
had
been
renamed
by
the
tsar
in
but
was
renamed
leningrad
in
memory
of
lenin
in


when
the
soviet
union
collapsed
in
leningrad
was
again
named
petersburg
which
it
remains
to
this
today


before
lenin
died
he
said
he
wished
to
be
buried
beside
his
mother


when
he
died
stalin
let
the
people
in
russia
look
at
his
body


because
people
kept
coming
they
decided
not
to
bury
him
and
preserved
his
body
instead


a
building
was
built
in
red
square
moscow
over
the
body
so
that
people
could
see
it


it
is
called
the
<collocation>lenin mausoleum</collocation>


many
russians
and
tourists
still
go
there
to
see
his
body
today

a
disease
usually
refers
to
the
invasion
of
the
body
by
pathogens


also
the
term
can
be
used
more
widely


sometimes
the
word
is
used
for
other
kinds
of
illness


diseases
can
cause
pain
feeling
bad
or
death
to
the
person
who
has
the
disease


the
word
disease
is
sometimes
used
to
include
disorders
such
as
parts
of
the
body
being
hurt
not

causes
of
disease
a
disease
can
be
caused
by
many
things


sometimes
germs
enter
our
body
through
food
water
or
air


a
person
can
be
infected
by
<collocation>infectious agents</collocation>
like
bacteria
viruses
or
fungus


disease
can
also
be
caused
by
eating
bad
or
old
foods


there
are
small
germs
in
old
foods
that
can
cause
diseases


sometimes
the
germs
produce
chemicals
or
toxins
which
causes
the
disease


one
of
the
most
common
causes
of
disease
is
<collocation>poor sanitation</collocation>
and
lack
of
clean
water


some
deadly
diseases
like
malaria
in
tropical
parts
of
the
world
are
spread
by
a
mosquito


animals
that
spread
disease
are
called
vectors


there
are
many
vectors
including
snails
ticks
and
fleas


some
people
are
born
with
genetic
diseases


these
are
diseases
because
of
an
error
or
mutation
in
a
person


an
example
of
a
mutation
is
cancer


living
or
working
in
an
unhealthy
environment
can
also
be
a
cause
for
diseases


diseases
are
more
common
in
older
people


treatments
of
disease
some
diseases
can
be
helped
with
medicine


infections
can
often
be
cured
by
antibiotics
though
resistance
to
antibiotics
is
a
problem


some
disease
may
be
helped
by
surgery


not
every
disease
can
be
helped
with
medicine
or
surgery
though


some
diseases
must
be
treated
during
the
whole
life
they
are
chronic
diseases


an
example
of
a
chronic
disease
is
diabetes


diabetes
can
be
treated
made
better
but
it
can
not
yet
be
cured
made
to
totally
go
away


people
who
usually
treat
diseases
are
called
doctors
or
physicians


prevention
of
disease
some
diseases
that
are
common
or
very
bad
are
tested
for
even
in
people
who
are
healthy


if
these
diseases
are
found
early
they
can
be
treated
before
they
cause
problems


an
example
would
be
checking
a
woman
for
<collocation>cervical cancer</collocation>
with
a
test
called
a
pap
smear


if
<collocation>cervical cancer</collocation>
is
found
early
it
can
be
cured


if
it
is
found
later
it
usually
causes
death


another
example
is
immunization


the
basic
of
it
is
to
make
the
body
ready
for
a
disease


the
body
has
its
own
defense
against
disease
called
the
immune
system


one
special
characteristic
of
the
immune
system
is
its
ability
to
remember


if
a
person
had
been
sick
before
and
had
recovered
the
immune
system
produce
a
substance
called
antibodies
which
fight
the
disease
if
it
comes
back
to
the
person


the
antibody
is
specific
to
a
particular
disease
or
antigen


an
example
of
this
is
measles
which
is
a
virus


a
person
usually
a
child
who
had
never
been
sick
with
measles
is
given
a
milder
form
of
the
virus
this
cause
the
immune
system
to
produce
antibodies
against
the
virus


if
this
person
is
exposed
to
the
same
virus
in
the
future
the
person
immune
system
will
remember
and
will
fight
the
virus


for
general
prevention
to
be
useful
the
disease
must
be
found
and
stopped
in
early
stage


the
disease
should
be
common
or
be
easy
to
recognize


the
test
for
the
disease
should
be
easy
work
all
the
time
and
not
hurt
people


the
society
is
and
can
recognize
most
common
symptoms
on
some
diseases


the
treatment
for
the
disease
should
be
safe
and
be
easy
for
people
to
get


epidemiology
main
epidemiology
epidemiology
is
the
study
of
the
cause
of
disease


some
diseases
are
more
popular
for
people
with
common
characteristics
like
similar
origins
sociological
background
food
or
nationality


without
good
<collocation>epidemiological research</collocation>
some
diseases
can
be
hard
to
track
and
to
name


some
diseases
can
be
taken
for
something
else


this
is
why
epidemiology
takes
a
huge
part
in
understanding
how
to
protect
ourselves
against
viruses
toxins
and
bacteria

happen
at

depending
on
temperature
or

for
example
wood
does
not
react
with
air
when
it
is
cold
but
if

is
made
hot
enough
it
will
start
to
burn


other
reactions
such
as
nuclear
reactions
differ
in
the
way
that
nuclear
reaction
does
not
need
a

they

cakes
are
baked
from
a
batter


batter
is
made
by
mixing
wet
ingredients
like
milk
and
eggs
with
dry
ingredients
like
sugar
and
flour


the
batter
is
baked
in
an
oven


this
way
of
baking
is
known
as
the
<collocation>muffin method</collocation>
because
muffins
are
made
this
way


just
like

cakes
rise
in
the
oven
because
they
contain
many
small
air
bubbles


as
cakes
rise
the
air
bubbles
expand


this
is
why
the
cake
<collocation>batter expands</collocation>
in
the
pan
often
to
twice
its
original
size


there
are
two
ways
of
forming
the
air
bubbles
which
create
different
types
of
cakes


almost
every
kind
of
cake
belongs
to
one
of
these
families

made
with
butter

another
fat
like
vegetable
shortening


the
fat

not
be
hard
or
liquid


mixing
sugar
with
fat
creates
many
very
small
air
bubbles


most
birthday

are
made
this
way


cupcakes
are
also
made
this
way
