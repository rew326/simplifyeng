the
hottest
season
of
the
year


in
some
places
summer
is
the
wettest
season
with
the
most
rain
and
in
other
places
it
is
a
dry
season


four
seasons
are
found
in
areas
which
are
not
too
hot
or
too
cold


summer
happens
to
the
north
and
south
sides
of
the
earth
at
opposite
times
of
the
year


in
the
north
part
of
the
world
summer
takes
place
between
the
months
of
june
and
september
and
in
the
south
part
of
the
world
it
takes
place
between
december
and
march


this
is
because
when
the
north
part
of
the
earth
points
towards
the

the

fields


most
electronic

fall
into
two
categories
processing
and
distribution
of
information


these
are
called
communications
systems


conversion
and
distribution
of
energy


these
are
called
control
systems


one
way
of
looking
at
an
electronic
system
is
to
separate
it
into
three
parts
inputs
electrical
or
<collocation>mechanical sensors</collocation>
which
take
signals
from
the
physical
world
in
the
form
of
temperature
pressure
and
convert
them
into
electric
current
and
<collocation>voltage signals</collocation>


<collocation>signal processing</collocation>
circuits
these
consist
of
<collocation>electronic components</collocation>
connected
together
to
manipulate

and
transform
the
information
contained
in
the
signals


outputs
actuators
or
other
devices
that
transform
current
and
<collocation>voltage signals</collocation>
back

information


for

set
it
input
is
a
broadcast
signal
received
from
an
antenna
or
a
wire
cable
provided
by
a

television
vendor


<collocation>signal processing</collocation>
circuits
inside

use
the

information
contained
in
the
received

the
television

device
converts
the

information
into

analysis
of
a

used
<collocation>analog circuits</collocation>


the

even

<collocation>pulse circuits</collocation>
<collocation>pulse circuits</collocation>
are
used
for
signals
that
require
<collocation>rapid pulses</collocation>
of
energy


for
example
aircraft
and
ground
radar
equipment
work
by
using
<collocation>pulse circuits</collocation>
to
create
and
send
high
powered
bursts
of
radio
energy
from
radar
transmitters


special
antennas
called
beam
or
dish
antennas
because
of
their
shape
are
used
to
send
transmit
the
high
powered
bursts
in
the
direction
the
beam
or
dish
antenna
is
pointed


the
radar
transmitter
pulses
or
bursts
of
radio
energy
hit
and
bounce
back
they
are
reflected
from
hard
and
metallic
objects


hard
objects
are
things
like
buildings
hills
and
mountains


metallic
objects
are
anything
made
of
metal
like
aircraft
bridges
or
even
objects
in

the

radar
energy
is
detected
by

<collocation>digital circuits</collocation>
together


the
pulse
and
<collocation>digital circuits</collocation>
in
<collocation>radar pulse</collocation>
receivers
are
used
to
show
the
location
and
distance
of
objects
which
have
reflected
the

transmitter
high

pulses


by
controlling
how
often
the
<collocation>rapid pulses</collocation>
of

energy
are
sent
out
by
a

called
the

and
how

it
takes
for
the

energy
to
come
back
to
the

can
tell
not
only
where
objects
are
but
also
how
far

they
are


<collocation>digital circuits</collocation>
in
a

receiver
calculate
the
distance
to
an
object
by
knowing
the
time
interval
between

<collocation>digital circuits</collocation>
count
how
long
it
takes
between
pulses
for
an
object
reflected
energy
to
be
detected
by
the
radar
receiver


since
<collocation>radar pulses</collocation>
are
sent
and
received
at
approximately
the
speed
of
light
the
distance
to
an
object
can
easily
be
calculated


this
is
done
in
<collocation>digital circuits</collocation>
by
multiplying
the
speed
of
light
by
the
time
it
takes
to
receive
the
radar
energy
reflected
back
from
an
object


the
time
between

often
called
pulse
rate
time
or
sets
the
limit
on
how
far

an
object
can
be
detected


that
distance
is
called
the
range
of
a
radar
transmitter
and
receiver


radar
transmitters
and
receivers
use
long
to
find
the
distance
to
objects
that
are

makes
it
possible
to
accurately
determine
the
distance

scalars
are
simple
numbers


they
are
used
for
measuring
things


many
things
can
be
measured
and
the
measure
can
be
explained
by
only
giving
the
number


suppose
we
are
measuring
a
rod


we
could
give
the
measured
length
as
metres
or
cm
depending
on
the
length
of
the
rod
under
observation


here
only
the
figure
or
along
with
the
unit
of
measure
is
enough
to
transmit
information
about
the
rod


other
examples
of
scalars
are
unit
of
mass


kilograms
unit
of
measuring
luminosity


candela
unit
of
length


metres
mass
is
measured
by
scalars
distances
are
measured
by
scalars


the
other
family
of
measurement
falls
under
the
category
of
vectors


a
laser
emits
photons


photons
from
greek
meaning
light
in
many
atomic
models
in
physics
are
particles
which
transmit
light


in
other
words
light
is
carried
over
space
by
photons


photon
is
an
elementary
particle
that
is
its
own


in
<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
each
photon
has
a
characteristic
quantum
of
energy


photons
have
a
rest
mass
of
zero


however
einstein
theory
of
relativity
says
that
they
do
have
a
certain
amount
of
momentum


before
the
photon
got
its
name
einstein
revived
the
proposal
that
light
consists
of
separate
pieces
of
energy
particles


these
particles
came
to
be
known
as
photons


a
photon
is
usually
given
the
symbol
gamma
<collocation>properties photons</collocation>
are
fundamental
particles


although
they
can
be
created
and
destroyed
their
lifetime
is
infinite


in
a
vacuum
all
photons
move
at
the
speed
of
light
c
which
is
equal
to
meters
approximately
kilometers
per
second


a
photon
has
a
given
frequency
which
determines
its
color


radio
technology
makes
great
use
of
frequency


beyond
the
visible
range
frequency
is
less
discussed
for
example
it
is
little
used
in
distinguishing
between
photons
and
infrared


frequency
is
equivalent
to
the
quantum
energy
of
the
photon
as
related
by
the
constant
equation
e
h
f
another
property
of
a
photon
is
its
wavelength


the
frequency
nu
wavelength
lambda
and
speed
of
light
c
are
related
by
the
equation
c
nu
lambda


wavelength
is
used
in
many
types
of
technology


the
quantum
energy
of
different
photons
is
used
in
infrared
technology
and
much
used
for
cameras
and
other
machines
that
use
visible
and
higher
than
visible
radiation


this
because
these
photons
are
energetic
enough
to
atoms


the
last
usable
property
of
a
photon
is
its
polarity


if
you
saw
a
giant
photon
coming
straight
at
you
it
could
appear
as
a
swath
whipping
vertically
horizontally
or
somewhere
in
between


polarized
sunglasses
stop
photons
swinging
up
and
down
from
passing


this
is
how
they
reduce
glare
as
light
bouncing
off
of
surfaces
tend
to
fly
that
way


lcd
screens
also
use
polarity
to
control
which
light
passes
through


some
animals
can
see
light
polarization


finally
light
has
a
spin
to
it


a
photon
spin
is
a
<collocation>subtle feature</collocation>
and
requires
expensive
equipment
to
detect


electromagnetism
in
particle
physics
photons
are
responsible
for
electromagnetic
force


electromagnetism
is
an
idea
that
combines
electricity
with
magnetism


one
common
way
that
we
experience
electromagnetism
in
our
daily
lives
is
light
which
is
caused
by
electromagnetism


electromagnetism
is
also
responsible
for
charge
which
is
the
reason
that
you
can
not
push
your
hand
through
a
table


since
photons
are
the
particle
of
electromagnetism
they
are
also
gauge


some
matter
called
dark
matter
is
not
believed
to
be
affected
by
electromagnetism


this
would
mean
that
dark
matter
does
not
have
a
charge
and
does
not
give
off
light


light
is
often
created
when
energy
hits
an
electron


this
energy
can
be
in
the
form
of
heat
<collocation>kinetic energy</collocation>
or
any
other
form


the
increase
of
energy
can
push
an
electron
up
one
level
in
a
shell
called
a


all
that
this
means
is
that
it
is
unstable
there
and
like
all
everything
else
wants
to
be
in
the
lowest
energy
state


if
being
in
the
lowest
energy
state
is
confusing
pick
up
a
pencil
and
drop
it


once
on
the
ground
the
pencil
will
be
in
a
lower
energy
state


when
the
electron
drops
back
down
to
its
lowest
energy
state
it
needs
to
release
the
energy
that
hit
it
and
it
must
obey
the
conservation
of
energy
energy
can
neither
be
created
nor
destroyed


electrons
release
this
energy
as
photons
and
at
higher
this
photon
can
be
seen
as
visible
light

is
a
vector


displacement
is
the
distance
that
something
moves
in
a
certain
direction


a
measure
of
distance
alone
is
a


force
that
includes
direction
is
a
vector


velocity
is
a
vector
because
it
is
a
speed
in
a
certain
direction


acceleration
is
the
rate
of
change
of
velocity


an
object
is
accelerating
if
it
is
changing
speed
or
changing
direction


how
to
add
vectors
adding
vectors
on
paper
using
the
head
to
tail
method
the
head
to
tail
method
of
adding
vectors
is
useful
for
doing
an
estimate
on
paper
of
the
result
of
adding
two
vectors


to
do
it
each
vector
is
drawn
as
an
arrow
with
an
amount
of
length
behind
it
where
each
unit
of
length
on
the
paper
represents
a
certain
magnitude
of
the
vector


draw
the
next
vector
with
the
tail
end
of
the
second
vector
at
the
head
front
of
the
first
vector


repeat
for
all
further
vectors
draw
the
tail
of
the
next
vector
at
head
of
the
previous
one


draw
a
line
from
the
tail
of
the
first
vector
to
the
head
of
the
last
vector
that
the
resultant
sum
of
all
the
vectors


it
called
the
head
to
tail
method
because
each
head
from
the
previous
vector
leads
in
to
the
tail
of
the
next
one

for
an
example
created
with
java
using
component
form
using
the
component
forms
of
vectors
two
add
two
vectors
literally
means
adding
the
components
of
the
vectors
to
create
a
new
vector


for
example
let
a
and
b
be
two
two
<collocation>dimensional vectors</collocation>


this
implies
that
both
vectors
can
be
written
in
terms
of
their
<collocation>respective components</collocation>
thus
a
a
x
a
y
and
b
b
x
b
y


suppose
c
is
the
sum
of
vectors
a
and
b
so
that
c
a
b


this
simply
implies
that
c
in
component
form
gives
the
following
c
a
x
b
x
a
y
b
y


note
that
and
are
called
unit
vectors


here
is
an
example
of
addition
of
two
vectors
using
their
component
forms

a
<collocation>soap bubble</collocation>
a
<collocation>soap bubble</collocation>
is
a
very
thin
film
of
soap
water


their
shape
is
a
hollow
round
ball
or
sphere


they
have
a
colorful
surface


<collocation>soap bubbles</collocation>
do
not
last
very
long


sometimes
they
break
in
the
air


when
they
touch
something
else
they
usually
break


when
people
talk
about
<collocation>soap bubbles</collocation>
they
think
about
them
being
pretty
but


so
they
are
a
symbol
for
other
things
that
are
pretty
but
or
unimportant


children
enjoy
playing
with
bubbles
