early
life
and
minority
william
was
the
son
of
robert
i
duke
of
normandy
by
his
concubine


he
was
born
in
normandy
in
or


william
became
the
duke
of
normandy
when
his
father
died
in


in
or
duke
robert
wanted
to
go
on
a
pilgrimage
to
jerusalem


he
made
his
noblemen
swear
to
make
his
young
son
william
their
duke
if
he
was
killed


but
william
minority
rule
of
normandy
did
not
start
well


some
normans
did
not
want
a
boy
as
their
duke


some
later
writers
say
william
was
not
well
accepted
as
the
duke
because
his
parents
were
not
married


but
during
william
time
there
were
no
social
consequences
of
being
a
bastard


a
historian
living
the
ralph
did
not
think
so


many
of
william
rivals
who
thought
they
should
be
duke
were
also
bastards


robert
ii
archbishop
of
rouen
was
a
powerful
man
in
normandy


he
protected
william


king
henry
i
of
france
also
approved
of
william


in
archbishop
robert
died


without
his
support
norman
nobles
began
fighting
among
themselves


some
wanted
william
out
of
the
way
and
tried
to
kill
him


one
of
william
servants
was
killed
in
the
very
room
where
william
slept


two
more
of
william
protectors
died
during
this
time


normandy
was
in
complete
disorder


in
william
held
a
church
council
in
normandy


at
that
council
the
church
made
a
new
law
called
the
truce
of
god


it
was
to
help
stop
all
the
private
wars


there
could
be
no
fighting
on
feast
days
or
fast
days


no
fighting
was
allowed
from
thursday
night
until
monday
morning


the
punishment
for
breaking
the
truce
was
excommunication


william
probably
reached
the
age
of
majority
in
about


he
no
longer
needed
tutors


he
could
now
rule
on
his
own


duke
of
normandy
the
private
wars
continued
into


william
rule
depended
on
the
loyalty
of
his
viscounts


by
the
fall
of
many
of
the
families
in
lower
normandy
began
plotting
to
replace
william
as
duke


guy
of
burgundy
william
cousin
was
sent
to
william
court
in
hopes
he
would
do
well
there


william
gave
guy
castles
at
and
vernon


but
guy
was
happy
with
this
and
decided
he
should
rule
normandy
himself


he
became
the
leader
of
what
was
by
now
an
open
revolt


two
of
william
viscounts
joined
guy


william
realized
this
was
a
serious
threat
and
he
asked
king
henry
for
help


the
french
king
came
right
away
and
brought
a
large
army


the
combined
armies
of
duke
william
and
king
henry
met
the
rebels
at


the
rebels
were
defeated
and
guy
fled
to
his
castle
at


william
kept
the
castle
cut
off
from
food
or
supplies
until
guy
gave
up
in


the
duke
forgave
his
cousin
but
guy
soon
returned
to
burgundy


william
victory
at
gave
him
some
control
of
normandy


a
church
council
met
in
october
near
the
battlefield
to
consider
a
new
truce
of
god


no
private
wars
would
be
allowed
from
wednesday
evening
through
monday
morning


also
no
such
fighting
was
allowed
during
advent
lent
easter
and
pentecost


this
followed
other
such
in
place
elsewhere
in
france


but
the
king
and
duke
were
both
excluded
from
this
truce


they
were
allowed
to
wage
war
during
these
times
to
keep
the
peace


william
peace
in
normandy
was
now
supported
by
the
church

the
battle
of
was
the
start
of
william
rise
to
power


as
the
king
had
stepped
in
it
was
more
his
victory
than
william


but
william
nobles
now
began
to
see
him
as
a
leader


he
could
now
think
about
taking
a
wife


shortly
before
william
decided
to
marry
matilda
of
flanders


she
was
the
daughter
of
v
of
flanders
and
of
france
who
was
the
daughter
of
king
robert
ii
of
france


before
it
could
take
place
pope
leo
ix
refused
to
allow
the
marriage


he
did
not
give
a
reason
but
the
two
were
cousins


some
time
between
and
the
two
married
anyway


a
marriage
to
matilda
of
flanders
was
an
important
step
upward
for
duke
william


she
was
the
niece
of
king
henry
i
of
france
william
overlord


matilda
was
closely
related
to
most
of
the
royal
families
of
europe


it
gave
status
to
the
duke
of
normandy
to
have
a
member
of
the
royal
family
as
his
wife


but
it
was
until
that
another
pope
nicholas
ii
lifted
the
ban
on
their
marriage


while
william
was
building
his
power
in
normandy
things
were
changing
around
him


king
henry
had
supported
him
and
william
had
helped
the
king
against
the
count
of


about
count
of
and
the
king
suddenly
made
peace


just
as
suddenly
the
king
turned
on
william


at
the
same
time
two
of
william
uncles
archbishop
and
count
william
of
rebelled
against
their
nephew


william
fought
his
uncle
at
the
castle
at


king
henry
now
led
a
large
force
army
into
normandy
to
help
count
william
of


but
duke
william
met
him
in
battle
and
won


without
the
king
army
to
help
the
castle
had
to
give
up


duke
william
sent
his
two
uncles
away
from
normandy


in
the
king
again
entered
normandy
with
a
large
hostile
force


he
split
his
army
in
two
and
led
the
southern
forces
himself


his
brother
led
the
second
force
east
of
the
seine
river


this
time
william
had
all
of
normandy
supporting
him


he
had
everything
that
could
be
used
as
food
removed
ahead
of
the
french
armies


this
would
cause
them
difficulty
in
keeping
their
soldiers
fed


william
also
split
his
soldiers
into
two
armies


william
forces
watched
the
king
armies
looking
for
any
chance
to
attack


when
forces
reached
the
town
of
they
found
plenty
of
food
and
drink


this
caused
his
forces
to
relax
and
enjoy
themselves


the
commanders
of
william
second
army
caught
them
by
surprise
and
killed
most
of
soldiers


those
who
did
survive
were
taken
prisoner
and
held
for
ransom


when
the
king
got
the
news
that
his
brother
army
had
been
destroyed
his
army
was
struck
with
panic


the
king
and
his
men
left
normandy
as
fast
as
they
could


king
henry
i
agreed
to
a
peace
that
lasted
three
years


but
in
the
king
broke
the
peace
and
invaded
normandy
again


just
as
before
william
kept
the
king
army
close
but
waited
for
the
best
time
to
strike


this
came
as
the
french
army
was
crossing
the
<collocation>dives river</collocation>
at


the
king
had
already
crossed
the
river
and
watched
as
his
army
was
destroyed
as
they
entered
the
water


he
took
what
remained
of
his
army
and
left
normandy
for
good


the
king
died
a
short
time
later


the
new
king
his
young
son
was
under
the
care
of
william
france
was
no
longer
hostile
to
normandy
and
this
allowed
william
the
freedom
to
expand


normandy
and
england
in
king
of
england
had
married
emma
sister
of
duke
richard
ii
of
normandy


the
alliance
formed
by
this
marriage
had
far
reaching
effects


when
king
came
to
the
throne
of
england
in
he
took
queen
emma
of
normandy
as
his
wife


her
two
sons
by
her
former
marriage
fled
to
normandy
for
their
own
safety


edward
the
older
son
stayed
in
normandy
for
many
years
at
the
court
of
the
dukes


the
last
duke
who
protected
him
there
was
his
cousin
william


edward
became
king
of
england
in


in
edward
made
william
his
heir


in
harold
was
in
normandy


while
he
was
there
he
promised
duke
william
he
would
support
him
as
successor
to
the
english
throne


on
january
edward
the
king
died


but
harold
did
not
respect
his
oaths


the
next
day
the
day
of
the
funeral
harold
was
crowned
king
of
england


the
story
was
that
on
his
deathbed
the
king
had
changed
his
mind
and
promised
harold
the
throne


harold
was
not
royalty
himself
and
had
no
legal
claim
on
the
throne


for
weeks
william
must
have
known
edward
was
dying


but
the
news
of
the
king
death
and
harold
taking
the
throne
must
have
been
a
surprise


norman
invasion
of
england
prelude
william
began
his
plans
for
invasion
almost
as
soon
as
he
received
news
of
the
events
in
england


he
called
a
meeting
of
his
greatest
men


william
made
plans
to
gather
a
large
army
from
all
over
france


his
influence
and
wealth
meant
he
could
mount
a
large
campaign


his
first
task
was
to
build
a
fleet
of
ships
to
carry
his
army
across
the
english
channel


then
he
started
gathering
an
army


his
friendship
with
france
and
flanders
meant
he
did
not
have
to
rely
only
on
his
own
army


he
hired
and
paid
soldiers
from
many
parts
of
europe


william
asked
for
and
got
the
support
of
the
pope
who
gave
him
a
banner
to
carry
into
battle


at
the
same
time
duke
william
was
planning
his
invasion
so
too
was
harold


the
king
of
england
knew
both
would
be
coming
but
he
kept
his
ships
and
forces
in
the
south
of
england
where
william
might
land


william
may
have
had
as
many
as
ships
in
his
invasion
fleet


they
had
favorable
winds
to
leave
normandy
on
the
night
of
september
