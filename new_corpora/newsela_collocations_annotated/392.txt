swimming
has
been
known
amongst
humans
since
prehistoric
times
the
earliest
record
of
swimming
dates
back
to
stone
age
from
around
<collocation>years ago</collocation>


competitive
swimming
started
in
europe
around
and
was
part
of
the
first
modern
<collocation>summer olympics</collocation>
in
athens
though
not
in
a
form
comparable
to
the
contemporary
events


it
was
not
until
that
regulations
were
implemented
by
the
international
swimming
federation
to
produce

archimedes
the
scientist
archimedes
is
also
well
known
for
being
the
first
person
to
understand
which
is
a
part
of
applied
mathematics


it
has
to
do
with
loads
that
do
not
move
for
example
in
buildings
or
bridges


he
also
understood
and
wrote
about
what
happens
when
things
float
in
liquids
which
is
called
buoyancy


archimedes
may
have
used
his
principle
of
buoyancy
to
determine
whether
the
<collocation>golden crown</collocation>
was
less
dense
than
solid
gold

archimedes
principle
the
weight
of
water
displaced
by
an
object
equals
the
amount
of
buoyancy
it
gets


it
has
practical
uses


it
can
be
used
to
measure
the
density
of
an
object
and
hence
whether
or
not
it
is
made
of
gold


the
story
of
the
<collocation>golden crown</collocation>
does
not
appear
in
the
surviving
works
of
archimedes


archimedes
may
have
got
a
solution
known
in
as
archimedes
principle
which
he
describes
in
his
treatise
on
floating
bodies


this
principle
states
that
a
body
immersed
in
a
fluid
experiences
a
buoyant
force
equal
to
the
weight
of
the
fluid
it
displaces


using
this
principle
it
would
have
been
possible
to
compare
the
density
of
the
<collocation>golden crown</collocation>
to
that
of
solid
gold
by
balancing
the
crown
on
a
scale
with
a
gold
reference
sample
then
immersing
the
apparatus
in
water


the
difference
in
density
between
the
two
samples
would
cause
the
scale
to
tip
accordingly


galileo
considered
it
probable
that
this
method
is
the
same
that
archimedes
followed
since
besides
being
very
accurate
it
is
based
on
demonstrations
found
by
archimedes
himself


archimedes
the
inventor
and
engineer
archimedes
is
also
famous
as
an
inventor
because
he
made
new
tools
and
machines


for
example
he
made
a
machine
to
lift
water
that
could
be
used
by
farmers
to
bring
water
to
their
crops


this
is
called
archimedes
screw


archimedes
probably
also
invented
a
machine
to
measure
distance
an
odometer


a
cart
was
built
with
wheels
that
turned
four
hundred
times
in
one
mile


a
pin
on
the
wheel
would
hit
a
tooth
gear
so
it
turned
once
for
every
mile


this
gear
would
then
make
a
small
stone
fall
into
a
cup


at
the
end
of
a
journey
one
could
count
the
number
of
stones
in
the
cup
to
find
the
distance


archimedes
also
made
a
system
which
one
person
could
pull
a
large
ship
with
just
one
rope


this
was
called
the
compound
pulley


this
is
an
important
machine
even
today
as
it
helps
people
in
everyday
life
although
the
versions
we
now
use
are
much
more
complicated


they
still
work
by
the
same
principle
though


archimedes
at
war
archimedes
also
invented
or
made
many
machines
used
in
war
for
example
he
made
better
catapults


this
was
during
the
punic
wars
which
were
between
rome
in
what
is
now
italy
and
the
city
of
in
what
is
now
north
africa


for
many
years
he
helped
stop
the
roman
army
from
attacking
syracuse
his
city


one
war
machine
was
called
the
claw
of
archimedes
or
the
iron
hand


it
was
used
to
defend
the
city
from
attacks
by
ships


ancient
writers
said
that
it
was
a
kind
of
crane
with
a
hook
that
lifted
ships
out
of
the
water
and
caused
their
destruction


another
story
about
archimedes
is
that
he
burned
roman
ships
from
far
away
using
many
mirrors
and
the
light
from
the
sun


this
is
perhaps
possible
but
it
is
perhaps
more
likely
that
this
was
done
with
flaming
missiles
from
a
catapult


after
many
years
the
roman
army
took
the
city
of
syracuse


one
of
the
soldiers
killed
archimedes
who
was
then
an
old
man


the
soldiers
had
perhaps
been
told
to
catch
archimedes
alive
so
it
may
have
been
a
mistake


the
story
is
that
archimedes
was
killed
while
drawing
a
mathematical
diagram
in
the
sand


he
was
so
busy
with
his
drawing
that
he
did
not
see
the
soldier
behind
him


his
famous
last
words
were
do
disturb
my
circles


tributes
to
archimedes
archimedes
is
thought
to
be
so
important
as
a
mathematician
that
scientists
have
honored
him
a
large
hole
or
crater
on
the
moon
is
named
after
archimedes


some
mountains
on
the
moon
are
called
the
montes

radio
is
a
way
to
send
electromagnetic
signals
over
a
long
distance
to
deliver
information
from
one
place
to
another


a
machine
that
sends
radio
signals
is
called
a
transmitter
while
a
machine
that
picks
up
the
signals
is
called
a
receiver


a
machine
that
does
both
jobs
is
called
a
transceiver


when
radio
signals
are
sent
out
to
many
receivers
at
the
same
time
it
is
called
a
broadcast


television
also
uses
radio
signals
to
send
pictures
and
sound


radio
signals
can
start
engines
moving
so
that
gates
open
on
their
own
from

see
radio
control


radio
signals
can
be
used
to
lock
and
unlock
the
doors
in

history
of
radio
many
people
worked
to
make
radio
possible


hertz
in
germany
first
showed
that
radio
waves
exist


marconi
in
italy
made
radio
into
a
practical
tool
of
telegraphy
used
mainly
by
ships
at
sea


he
is
sometimes
said
to
have
invented
radio


later
inventors
learned
to
transmit
voices
which
led
to
broadcasting
of
news
music
and
entertainment
uses
of
radio
radio
was
first
created
as
a
way
to
send
telegraph
messages
between
two
people
without
wires
but
soon
radio
brought
voice
communication
including
and
eventually
<collocation>mobile phones</collocation>


now
an
important
use
is
to
broadcast
music
news
and
entertainers
including
talk
radio


radio
shows
were
used
before
there
were
tv
programs


in
the
the
us
president
started
sending
a
message
about
the
country
every
week
to
the
american
people


companies
that
make
and
send
radio
programming
are
called
radio
stations


these
are
sometimes
run
by
governments
and
sometimes
by
private
companies
who
make
money
by
sending
advertisements


other
radio
stations
are
supported
by
local
communities


these
are
called
community
radio
stations


in
the
early
days
manufacturing
companies
would
pay
to
send
complete
stories
by
radio


these
were
often
plays
or
dramas


because
companies
who
made
soap
often
paid
for
them
these
were
called
<collocation>soap operas</collocation>


radio
waves
are
still
used
to
send
messages
between
people


talking
to
someone
with
a
radio
is
different
than
talk
radio


citizen
band
radio
and
amateur
radio
use
radio


policemen
firemen
and
other
people
who
help
in
emergency
use
a
radio
emergency
communication
system
to
communicate
talk
to
each
other


it
is
like
a
<collocation>mobile phone</collocation>
which
also
uses
radio
signals
but
the
distance
they
reach
is
shorter
and
both
people
must
use
the
same
kind
of
radio


the
word
radio
is
sometimes
used
to
mean
only
broadcasting


most
broadcasting
uses
lower
frequency
and
longer
wavelength
than
most
television
broadcasting


microwaves
have
even
higher
frequency
shorter
wavelength


they
also
are
used
to
transmit
television
and
radio
programs
and
for
other
purposes


<collocation>communications satellites</collocation>
relay
microwaves
around
the
world


a
radio
receiver
does
not
need
to
be
directly
in
view
of
the
transmitter
to
receive
program
signals


low
frequency
radio
waves
can
bend
around
hills
by
diffraction
although
repeater
stations
are
often
used
to
improve
the
quality
of
the
signals


<collocation>shortwave radio</collocation>
frequencies
are
also
reflected
from
an
electrically
charged
layer
of
the
upper
atmosphere
called
the
ionosphere


the
waves
can
bounce
between
the
ionosphere
and
the
earth
to
reach
receivers
that
are
not
in
the
line
of
sight
because
of
the
curvature
of
the
earth
surface


they
can
reach
very
far
sometimes
around
the
world


radio
telescopes
receive
radio
waves
from
the
sky
to

this
makes
it
easier

gives
people
who

vandalism
is
bad


some
vandalism
is
to

monopoly
was
created
by
elizabeth
based
on
the
economic
concept
of
land
monopoly


created
the
game
in
to
explain
the
single
tax
theory
of
henry
george


she
wanted
it
to
be
an
educational
tool
to
highlight
the
negative
aspects
of
concentrating
land
in
private
monopolies


her
game
which
she
called
the
landlord
game
was
beginning
in


in
the
original
rules
players
could
agree
to
share
the
land
rents
and
everyone
would
win
which
was
not
as
exciting
as
the
current
rules
unfortunately


later
on
an
inaccurate
myth
developed
that
charles
had
created
the
game


the

the
objective

the
the
object

is
to
own

that
no

owns
you
can

want
to
buy
it
the

sells
it
at

not
everyone
plays
by
the
auction
rule


all
of
the
prices
for

land
are
on

once
you
own
the
land
players
must
pay
a
rent
if

are
waiting
on
your
land


if
you
land
on
a
chance
or
a
<collocation>community chest</collocation>
card
you
must
do
what
it
says


for

go
to

directly
to
jail
advance
to
go
or
go
to
pall
mall
if
you
roll
doubles
the

number
on

you
get
to

again


if
you
roll
doubles
three
