nucleus

how
the

around

formed

the

it
is

in

was

it
completes
a

that
means
it
travels

the
hubble
itself
is
the
size
of
a

still
small
enough
to
fit

launch
the
telescope
was
launched
in
by
a
<collocation>space shuttle</collocation>


when
it
entered
orbit
everything
seemed
fine


but
there
was
a
problem
with
the
telescope
that
was
not
discovered
until
it
started
taking
pictures

during

images
after
problems
when
the
took
its
first
pictures
astronomers
were
happy
to
see
the
images
but
they
were
not
as
sharp
and
as
crisp
as
expected


telescopes
in
space
can
take
better
pictures
than
telescopes
on
earth
but
for
some
reason
the
pictures
were
not
better
than
the
pictures
taken
on
earth


they
found
a
problem
with
the
telescope
mirror


the
mirror
was
not
curved
right
but
only
by
inches
as
thick
as
a
piece
of
paper


still
this
was
enough
to
cause
the
images
to
be
blurred


some
said
that
hubble
was
nearsighted


repair
another
<collocation>space shuttle</collocation>
was
soon
sent
up
to
repair
the
<collocation>space telescope</collocation>


the
repair
was
not
easy


the
astronauts
had
to
install
some
small
mirrors
to
correct
the
light
from
the
big
mirror


the
big
mirror
could
still
be
used


it
took
five
days
of
space
walks


when
astronaut
story
opened
one
of
the
doors
on
hubble
to
install
a
new
camera
the
door
would
not
close
so
and
the
other
astronauts
had
to
think
of
a
creative
way
to
get
around
the
problem


eventually
hubble
was
fixed
