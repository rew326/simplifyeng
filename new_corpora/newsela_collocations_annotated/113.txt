romans
invaded
what

england
and
wales
calling
it
britannia


to
the

was
land
not

by
the
romans


its
people
were
the


this
meant
the
scottish
were
not
affected
by
the
romans
in
the
same
way
the
english
were


the
sea
was
very
important
for
trade
reasons


because
of
where
scotland
is
in
the
world
and
its
strong
reliance
on
trade
routes
by
sea
the
nation
held
close
links
in
the
south
and
east
with
the
baltic
countries
and
through
ireland
with
france
and
europe


following
the
acts
of
union
and
industrial
revolution
scotland
grew
to
be
one
of
the
largest
commercial
intellectual
and
industrial
states
in

main
wars
of
scottish
independence
the
wars
of
scottish
independence
were
many
military
campaigns
fought
between
scotland
and
england
in
the
late
and
early
centuries


the
first
war
began
with
the
english
invasion
of
scotland
in
and
ended
with
the
signing
of
the
treaty
of
in


the
second
war
began
with
the
english
supported
invasion
of
scotland
by
edward
and
the
disinherited
in
and
ended
around
with
the
signing
of
the
treaty
of
berwick


the
wars
were
part
of
a
great
national
crisis
for
scotland
and
the
period
became
one
of
the
most
important
moments
in
the
nation
history


at
the
end
of
both
wars
scotland
still
was
a
free
and
independent
country
which
was
its
main
aim
throughout
the
conflict


the
wars
were
also
important
for
other
reasons
such
as
the
invention
of
the
longbow
as
an
important
weapon
in
medieval
warfare


a
series
of
deaths
in
the
line
of
succession
in
the
followed
by
king
alexander
iii
death
in
left
the
scottish
crown
in
crisis


his
granddaughter
margaret
the
maid
of
norway
a
old
girl
was
the
heir


edward
i
of
england
as
margaret
suggested
that
his
son
also
a
child
and
margaret
should
marry
stabilising
the
scottish
line
of
succession


in
margaret
guardians
agreed
to
this
but
margaret
herself
died
in
on
her
voyage
from
norway
to
scotland
of
sea
sickness
before
she
was
made
queen
or
her
marriage
could
take
place


because
there
was
no
clear
heir
to
the
throne
anymore
the
scottish
people
decided
to
ask
edward
i
of
england
to
choose
their
king


the
strongest
candidate
was
called
robert
bruce


robert
bruce
had
castles
all
around
the
country
and
had
a
private
army


but
edward
wanted
to
invade
scotland
so
he
chose
the
weaker
candidate
who
was
john


he
had
the
strongest
claim
to
the
throne
and
became
king
on
november


robert
bruce
decided
to
accept
this
decision
his
grandson
and
namesake
later
took
the

as

over
the
next
few
years
edward
i
kept
trying
to
undermine
both
the
authority
of
king
john
and
the
independence
of
scotland


in
john
on
the
recommendation
of
his
<collocation>chief councillors</collocation>

captured
by
the

executed
him
for
treason

did
not
commit
treason
as
he
was
not
loyal
to
england


robert

murdered
john
a

such
as

cancel
