they

to

by

this

how

it


they

of
time
putting

and
may
get

if
someone

is

about
million
people
including

parts
of

libya

tunisia


it
is
mostly
derived
from

with
some

from

etruscan
and
elsewhere


it
is
called
an
language
that
means
that
the

can
be
changed
by
changing
their
endings


italian
nouns
are
either
masculine

feminine
these
are

normally
only

the
ending
of
verbs
are
quite
complicated
because
they
depend
upon
the

of
the
verb
past

future
and
so
on
and
on
the
person
of
the
verb
i
you

because
of
that
the
personal

is
not
always
needed

it
is
in

so
io
i

they

let

there
are
very
many
of
these
endings
to
learn
it
is
a
difficult
part
of
italian


but
pronunciation
is
simple
there
are
just
a
few
rules
to
learn
and
hardly
any
difficult
sounds


many
italian
words
for
food
have
entered
the

many
technical

in
