predictions
a
test
is
a
way
to
measure
a
text
for
how
easy
it
is
to
read


tests
give
a
prediction
as
to
how
difficult
readers
will
find
a
particular
text


they
do
this
by
measuring
one
or
both
of
the
two
main
causes
as
follows
word
difficulty
word
difficulty
is
usually
measured
by
<collocation>vocabulary lists</collocation>
or
word
length


in
bertha
lively
and
sidney
published
the
first
reading
ease
formula


they
had
been
concerned
that
science
textbooks
in
junior
<collocation>high school</collocation>
had
so
many
technical
words


they
felt
that
teachers
spent
all
class
time
explaining
their
meaning


they
argued
that
their
formula
would
help
to
measure
and
reduce
the
<collocation>vocabulary burden</collocation>
of
textbooks


their
formula
used
the
word
list
as
a
basis


manually
it
took
three
hours
to
apply
the
formula
to
a
book


<collocation>vocabulary lists</collocation>
several
<collocation>vocabulary lists</collocation>
have
been
published
by
researchers


these
lists
are
based
on
samples
of
published
texts
in
english
and
less
often
samples
of
recorded
spoken
language


the
lists
differ
slightly
according
to
the
sources
chosen
but
they
are
very
reliable


the
items
listed
may
represent
more
than
one
actual
word
they
are


for
instance
the
entry
be
contains
within
it
the
occurrences
of
is
was
be
and
are


the
top
account
for
of
all
the
words
in
the
oxford
english
corpus


the
reading
teachers
book
of
lists
claims
that
the
first
words
make
up
about
of
all
printed
material
in
english
and
that
the
first
make
up
about
of
all
written
material


one
of
the
first
tests
the
dale
formula
used
a
vocabulary
list


it
counted
the
number
of
listed
words
in
a
passage
and
applied
a
formula
which
gave
a
grade
level


it
was
used
to
rate
textbooks
for
grade
levels
in
us
school
districts


it
is
easy
in
principle
to
use
a
vocabulary
list
as
part
of
a
measure


the
list
is
organised
as
a
table


the
percentage
of
listed
words
in
a
passage
gives
the
data
for
the
formula
and
the
user
is
presented
with
a
grade
level


word
length
this
is
called
an
index
or
a
proxy


this
is
because
word
length
is
correlated
with
word
frequency
and
word
frequency
is
correlated
with
word
difficulty


longer
words
are
on
average
harder
than
short
words


word
length
is
measured
by
counting
the
letters
in
each
word
or
by
counting
syllables


since
most
syllables
have
one
vowel
some
computer
programs
count
vowels
per
average
word


a
few
tests
measure
the
percentage
of
words
on
a
list
the
list
is
based
on
the
known
frequency
of
words
in
a
language


sentence
<collocation>difficulty sentence</collocation>
difficulty
is
usually
measured
by
sentence
length


this
again
is
an
index
because
longer
sentences
are
on
average
harder
than
short
sentences


computers
count
the
number
of
words
between
full
stops
but
this
is
a
method


humans
can
judge
whether
a
or
colon
should
count
as
the
end
of
a
sentence
for
testing
purposes


since
both
factors
may
vary
independently
of
each
other
the
best
prediction
is
gained
by
devising
a
formula
with
makes
use
of
both
indices


what
this
means
is
that
a
single
score
is
produced
for
a
text
and
that
score
is
looked
up
on
a
table
or
graph


that
tells
you
how
difficult
the
text
is
in
terms
of
either
a
an
american
school
grade
level
or
b
an
artificial
scale
of
to


either
way
is
effective


what
really
makes
a
difference
is
methods
using
both
indices
are
more
reliable
than
methods
using
only
one
index


<collocation>direct measurement</collocation>
it
is
possible
to
get
a
good
prediction
by
getting
a
group
of
subjects
to
read
through
a
passage
followed
by
questions


even
better
is
a
method
called
where
subjects
fill
in
blanks
on
a
text
they
have
not
seen
before


the
percentage
of
correctly
completed
blanks
is
an
outstandingly
good
predictor
of
text
difficulty


naturally
this
kind
of
direct
measure
requires
subjects
and
a
skilled
experimenter


it
also
requires
the
prior
preparation
of
texts
suitable
for
the
chosen
sample
of
subjects


the
method
is
therefore
too
expensive
for
widespread
use


types

can
perform
tests
himself
by

and

theater
mostly
american
english
has
several
meanings


the
word
comes
originally
from
the
greek
meaning
roughly
a
place
to
behold


in
american
english
the
word
theater
can
mean
either
a
place
where
films
are
shown
this
is
also
called
a
cinema
or
a
place
where
live
stage
plays
are
performed


in
british
english
theater
means
a
place
where
live
plays
are
performed


some
people
both
english
and
american
use
the
spelling
theater
to
mean
a
place
where
live
plays
are
performed
and
the
spelling
theater
to
mean
a
cinema


theatre
can
also
mean
the
business
of
putting
on
plays


an
actor
might
say
i
am
in
the
theater
business
or
a
writer
might
say

meaning
that
they
write

than

of

the
first
people
we
know
created
plays
were
the
ancient
greeks
about
the
year


they
divided
plays
into
two
kinds
tragedy
and
comedy


this
division
is
still
used
today


the
best
known
ancient
greek
writers
of
plays
are
aeschylus
sophocles
euripides
and


some
of
their
plays
survived
and
are
still
performed
today


these
ancient
greek
plays
were
performed
outdoors
in
large
so
that
many
people
could
see
them


there
were
contests
among
the
playwrights
people
who
write
plays
are
called
playwrights
and
the
winner
would
get
a
prize


the
greeks
were
full
of
brilliant
ideas


they
used
mechanical
devices
like
<collocation>trap doors</collocation>
and
the
machina
a
crane
for
gods
on
and
off
the
stage
hence
deus
ex
machina


they
had
a
greek
chorus
that
offered
information
to
help
the
audience
follow
the
performance


the
chorus
comments
on
themes
and
shows
how
an
audience
might
react
to
the
drama


the
players
wore
masks


illustrations
on
vases
show
masks
covering
the
entire
face
and
head
with
holes
for
the
eyes
and
a
small
aperture
for
the
mouth
plus
a
wig


the
mask
was
to
melt
into
the
face
and
allow
the
actor
to
vanish
into
the
role


therefore
onlookers
did
not
think
about
the
actor
but
thought
about
the
character


<collocation>middle ages</collocation>
in
the
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>
the
catholic
church
began
to
use
theater
as
a
way
of
telling
the
stories
from
the
bible
to
people
who
did
not
know
how
to
read


they
wrote
<collocation>mystery plays</collocation>
where
each
part
of
the
bible
story
would
be
a
play
put
on
by
a
different
group
of
people


they
also
wrote
<collocation>miracle plays</collocation>
which
were
plays
about
the
lives
of
the
saints


there
were
also
morality
plays
which
taught
the
audiences
how
to
live
a
good
christian
life


dell
arte
plays
and
columbine
in
the
groups
of
actors
who
would
tour
around
italy
performing
comic
plays
to
entertain
townspeople


these
plays
were
called
dell
arte
and
different
stories
would
be
created
around
the
same
group
of
characters


often
the
spoken
lines
would
be
made
up
by
the
actors
for
each
performance


other
kinds
of
plays
called
neoclassical
dramas
and
neoclassical
comedies
were
also
popular
in
italy
and
in
france
at
this
time


these
plays
were
written
to
copy
the
style
of
the
plays
from
ancient
greece
and
rome

at
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
the
traveling
actors
began
to
perform
in
fixed
theater
buildings


this

the
period
when
william
shakespeare
wrote


he
lived
from
to


at
that
time
in
england
women
were
not
allowed
to
perform
so
male
actors
would
play
female
characters


his
theater
was
in
london
england


it
was
called
the
globe


it
was
an
outdoor
theater
and
plays
were
performed
in
the
daytime
for
large
audiences


his
plays
were
very
popular
and
many
are
still
performed
today


many
scholars
and
theater
people
believe
shakespeare
was
one
of
the
best
playwrights
a
writer
of
plays


he
wrote
many
kinds
of
plays
tragedies
comedies
romances
and
also
history
plays


all
of
his
plays
are
written
in
beautiful
poetic
language


shakespeare
often
wrote
plays
set
in
italy
or
in
exotic
places
that
would
be
interesting
to
london
audiences


his
plays
are
still
popular
today
for
many
reasons


his
characters
the
people
in
his
plays
are
interesting
and
talk
about
interesting
ideas


the
stories
he
tells
in
his
plays
are
often
exciting
very
funny
in
the
comedies
or
very
sad
in
the
tragedies
and
make
you
want
to
know
what
happens
to

characters


he
also
talks
in

plays
about
things
we
still

like

hatred
jealousy
and
foolishness

ii
playwrights
in
europe
and
the
united
states
began
doing
plays
in
a
new
style
called
theatre
of
the
absurd


after
seeing
the
horrors
of
war
these
playwrights
felt
that
all
their
old
values
had
been
destroyed


playwrights
such
as
<collocation>samuel beckett</collocation>
harold
and
<collocation>jean genet</collocation>
wrote
plays
that
are
considered
to
be
theatre
of
the
absurd


the
theatre
of
the
absurd
plays
have
some
of
the
same
ideas
that
are
found
in
the
philosophy
a
way
of
thinking
called
existentialism


existentialism
is
very
different
from
many
other
philosophies


most
religions
and
say
that
human
life
has
a
meaning
or
a
purpose


the
philosophy
of
existentialism
is
that
human
life
does
not
have
a
meaning
or
a
purpose


when
something
has
no
meaning
it
is
absurd


absurd
means
means
silly
and
meaningless


the
plays
written
in
this
style
make
people
think
about
questions
like
what
is
it
like
to
be
a
person
in
the
world


and
what
does
it
mean
for
a
person
to
be

are
often
filled
with
sad
emotions

as
worry
fear
and
thoughts
about

education
tests
measure
the

to
a
<collocation>particular subset</collocation>
of
subject

at

moment
in

being
understood
that
the
measurement
can
vary
considerably
and
randomly
according
to
the
particular
questions
being
asked


people
and
animals
can
also
be
tested
for
illnesses


for
example
a
blood
test
can
be
used
to
check
for
disease


rarely
people
use
tests
to
check
people
hearts


for
instance
in
a
famous
rap
song
in

the
lyrics
were
about
a
boyfriend
telling
his

i

do

i
have

forgive
me
but
i
have

it
all
a
test


many
people
accuse
this
theory
as
an
excuse
to
be
offensive
or
an
excuse
to
break
up
with
his
girlfriend

it
does

horizon
that
is
imposed
on
everyone
at
once


it
may
be
used
to
try
to
achieve
fairness
in
some
system
of
ethics


for
instance
if
poor
people
and
rich
people
are
debating
something
a
time
limit
may
be
imposed
so
that
the
rich
people
can
not
keep
debating
until
the
poor
people
have
to
go
to
work
and
lose


time
limits
are
very
important
in
accounting
so
that
everyone
can
report
their
results
for
tax
and
investment
purposes
at
the
same
time


this
in
turn
creates
deadlines
for
the
accountant
and
those
reporting


however
the
deadline
is
imposed
by
an
authority
whereas
the
time
limit
is
imposed
by
a
system


so
there
can
be
slack
in
a
deadline
so
that
results
do
not
have
to
be
reported
always
very
fast


for
example
in
the
united
states
of
america
the
end
of
the
calendar
year
on
december
is
the
time
limit
for
taxes
but
the
deadline
for
reporting
is
april


sometimes
the
government
allows
more
time
as
it
did
for
the
families
of
those
who
were
killed
in
the
september
attacks
