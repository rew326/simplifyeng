an
advertising
computer
program
that
can
be
put
there
by
other
people
on
someone
computer
sometimes
without
their
permission


it
is
controversial
because
sometimes
businesses
put
the
program
there
so
they
can
see
what
people
are
doing
or
what
web
pages
they
are
browsing


they
then
put
an
advertisement
that
is
of
the
same
subject
as
the
the
person
is
looking
at


this
can
be
good
if
the
person
is
trying
to
buy
something
but
many
people
do
not
want
advertisements


many
people
also
do
not
want
other
people
to
find
out
what
they
are
doing
or
what
web
pages
they
are
looking
at


an
example
is
in
the
popular
file
sharing
program


when
someone
downloads
it
it
installs
on
their
computer
that
then
sends
advertisements
to
the
computer


some
people
do
not
like
this
so
they
use
an
illegally
changed
version
of
this
program
called
lite


<collocation>removal tools</collocation>
<collocation>removal tools</collocation>
have
been
developed
to
assist
users
in

out
these

like
many
programs
that
people
use
for
security
the

must
be
changed
often

a

commonly
used
for
a
person
sex
male
or
female


when
people
use
the
word
gender
in
this
way
it
is
often
because
sex
has
many
other
meanings
making
it
easy
to
misunderstand


in
social
sciences
there
is
a
difference
between
sex
and
gender
the
word
sex
describes
someone
body


it
says
whether
someone
is
physically
male
or
female


the
word
gender
describes
someone
personality
or
character


it
says

somewhat

in
view
open
and
closed
syllables
the
way
of
how
vowels
are
pronounced
depends
on
the
fact
if
the
syllable
is
open
or
closed


if
a
syllable
is
open
short
written
vowels
are
spoken
as
long
ones


short
written
vowels
are
only
spoken
short
if
the
syllable
is
closed


example
the
word
can
be
divided
into
syllables
ten


because
is
open
the
a
is
pronounced
like
aa


the
word
plat
only
has
one
syllables
and
the
a
is
therefore
short
just
a


there
is
however
an
exception
to
this
rule


this
is
the
e


this
is
because
e
can
also
be
a
mute
e
schwa
character


in
most
words
where
an
open
syllable
ends
with
e
it
is
a
short
therefore
open
syllables
with
a
long
e
ee
are
written
as
ee


example
the
word
me
contains
an
e
and
is
not
pronounced
as
mee


mee
has
a
totally
different
meaning


there
are
however
exceptions
to
this
rule
as
well


this
can
be
seen
in
the
word


this
word
can
be
divided
into
three
syllables
mee
ne
men


the
e
in
the
first
two
syllables
are
long
ones
but
the
last
one
is
a
mute
the
mute
e
also
occurs
in
the
ending
of
verbs
usually
en

not

with
a

in
the
south
of
the

the

spoken
differently

called
soft

hard

grammar
the
grammar
of
dutch
is
slightly
different
from
english


the
order
in
which
words
are
put
in
sentences
are
different
in
complex
sentences


the
most
simple
is
subject
verb


the
dutch
language
has
few
grammatical
tenses


the
most
used
are
present
simple
past
simple
present
perfect
past
perfect
the
most
simple
is
the
present
simple


the
is
used
when
something
is
occurring
now
or
regularly
like
he
eats
regularly


most
verbs
are
conjugated
changed
in
a
regular
form
these
verbs
are
called
regular
verbs


the
word
stem
of
the
verb
is
still
there
in
all
of
the
conjugations
changes


the
correct
way
of
doing
this
is
person
verb
<collocation>conjugation example</collocation>
with
to
walk
ik
i
stem
<collocation>ik loop</collocation>

stem
t
stem
t
we
stem
en
infinitive
they
stem
en
you
plural
stem
en
u
you
polite
stem
t
u
note
the
stem
of
a
verb
is
the
infinitive
of
the
verb
without
the
final
en


in
some
verbs
the
first
syllable
is
open
and
any
vowel
therefore
is
long


the
stem
changes
to
a
written
long
vowel


so
the
stem
of
becomes
loop


if
the
en
is
then
added
to
the
stem
for
example
with
the
written
form
becomes
short
again
but
it
still
will
be
spoken
as
a
long
vowel


the
past
form
of
the
is
the
past
simple


the
way
how
verbs
are
conjugated
changed
in
the
is
not
easy
to
understand
and
is
mistaken
often


this
is
because
some
verbs
are
conjugated
by
adding
a
d
while
others
are
conjugated
while
adding
a
a
way
of
solving
this
problem
is
the
t


if
the
verb
without
en
the
stem
in
most
verbs
but
not
always
ends
with
a
consonant
which
is
also
in
t
the
verb
is
changed
with
a
example
the
verb
to
talk
is
changed
with
a
t
because
<collocation>prat ends</collocation>
with
a
the
verb
can
now
be
changed
as
the
following
person
verb
conjugation
with
t
result
with
<collocation>ik stem</collocation>
<collocation>te ik</collocation>
stem
te
stem
te
stem
ten
they
stem
ten
stem
ten
u
stem
te
u
there
are
however
words
in
t
are
not
so
easy


this
is
for
instance
in
the
word
to
fear


the
stem
of
the
verb
is
so
it
seems
that
the
verb
is
changed
with
a
this
is
not
true
it
changed
with
a
d
because
minus
en
is


the
z
is
not
in
t
so
the
verb
is
changed
with
a
the
verb
can
now
be
changed
as
the
following
person
verb
conjugation
with
d
result
with

verbs
although
the
dutch
have
a
kind
of
present
continuous
the
ing
form
of
verbs
in
english
they
do
not
use
it
much


example
the
i
am
eating
is
in
dutch
ik
which
is
literally
i
eat


the
present
continuous
in
dutch
would
be
ik
ben
but
this
is
almost
never
used


actually
there
are
three
types
of
continuous
verbs
in
dutch


the
first
type
is
a
form
of
the
verb
to
be
with
the
actual
continuous
verb


this
is
done
by
adding
de
on
the
infinitive


it
not
wrong
to
use
this
in
dutch
but
it
will
sound
very
odd


it
is
only
used
in
very
formal
texts


the
second
type
is
a
type
where
the
verb
actually
functions
as
an
adverb


depending
on
subject
the
verb
is
changed
by
adding
either
a
d
or
de
to
the
infinitive


the
verb
then
has
the
function
of
while


an
example
de
uit


in
english
this
is
he
walked
out
of
the
supermarket
while
drinking


the
third
type
is
a
type
which
is
used
a
lot


the
use
of
this
type
can
be
compared
with
the
english
type
of
continuous


it
is
used
when
something
is
being
done
at
that
moment
but
still
not
completed
yet


it
is
made
up
by
a
form
of
het
the
infinitive


example
ik
ben
het
which
means
i
am
walking
at
the
moment

an

is
a

a

of
symbols
for

the
basic
symbols
in
an
alphabet
are
called
letters


in
an

each
letter
is
a
symbol
for
a
sound

sounds

the
alphabet

it
was

also
use
the

it
is
the

alphabet
which
is
based
on
the
greek
alphabet
used
for
russian
and
bulgarian
used
for

it
seems
that
the
idea
of
an
alphabet
a
script
based
entirely
upon
sound
arose
only
once
and
has
been
copied
and
adapted
to
suit
many
different
languages


although
no
alphabet
fits
its
language
perfectly
it
is
flexible
enough
to
fit
any
language
approximately


it
was
a
unique
invention

calligraphy

our
alphabet
is
called
the
roman
alphabet
as
compared
with
the
cyrillic
and
other


all
of
these
come
from
the
ancient
greek
alphabet
which
dates
back
to
about
to


the
greek
alphabet
was
probably
developed
from
the
<collocation>phoenician script</collocation>
which
appeared
somewhat
earlier
and
had
some
similar


the
phoenicians
spoke
a
semitic
language
usually
called
canaanite


the
semitic
group
of
languages
includes
arabic
maltese
hebrew
and
also
aramaic
the
language
spoken
by
jesus


we
do
not
know
much
about
how
the
idea
arose
but
the
phoenicians
a
trading
people
came
up
with
letters
which
were
adapted
by
the
early
greeks
to
produce
their
alphabet


the
one
big
difference
is
that
the
<collocation>phoenician script</collocation>
had
no
<collocation>pure vowels</collocation>


arabic
script
has
vowels
which
may
but
do
not
have
to
be
shown
by
small
marks
above
or
below
the
line


the
oldest
qu
ran
manuscripts
had
no
and
israeli
children
to
about
the
third
grade
use
texts
with
vowel
dots
added


no
ancient
script
or
not
had
<collocation>pure vowels</collocation>
before
the
greeks


the
greek
alphabet
even
has
two
vowels
for
e
and
two
for
o
to
distinguish
between
the
long
and
short
sounds


it
is
fairly
clear
from
this
that
careful
thought
went
into
both
the
<collocation>phoenician invention</collocation>
and
the
greek
adaptation
but
no
details
survive
of
either
process


<collocation>semitic scripts</collocation>
apparently
derive
from
a
script
of
which
only
inscriptions
plus
doubtful
are
known


it
is
thought
by
some
researchers
that
the
original
source
of
this
script
was
the
<collocation>egyptian hieratic</collocation>
script
which
by
the
late
middle
kingdom
about
had
added
some
signs
for
representing
the
consonants
of
foreign
names


egyptian
activity
in
was
at
its
height
at
that
time


a
similar
idea
had
been
suggested
many
years
previously


other
writing
systems
other
writing
systems
do
not
use
symbols
that
mean
a
sound
but
symbols
that
mean
a
word
or
a
syllable


in
the
past
such
writing
systems
were
used
by
many
cultures
but
today
they
are
almost
only
used
by
languages
people
speak
in
asia


originally
in
the
dynasty
chinese
writing
was
mainly
pictographic
using
pictures
to
show
words
or
ideas


now
only
of
chinese
characters
are
pictographic


of
modern
characters
are
<collocation>sp characters</collocation>


these
are
a
pair
of
symbols
one
for
meaning
and
the
other
for
p


in
many
cases
the
p
and
parts
are
put
together
into
one
joint
character
