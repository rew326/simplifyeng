consists

while
the
insects
they
eat
including

ostriches
do
not
have

and
so
can
not

do


instead
they
swallow

ostriches
normally
spend
the
winter
months
in
pairs
or
alone


during
breeding
season
and
sometimes
during
extreme
periods
ostriches
live
in
nomadic
groups
of
five
to
birds
led
by
a
top
hen
that
often
travel
together
with
other
grazing
animals
such
as
zebras
or
antelopes


with
their
acute
eyesight
and
hearing
ostriches
can
sense
predators
such
as
lions
from
far
away


when
being
pursued
by
a
predator
they
have
been
known
to
reach
speeds
in
excess
of
convert
and
can
maintain
a
steady
speed
of
convert
which
makes
the
ostrich
the
world
fastest
animal


when
lying
down
and
hiding
from
predators
the
birds
lay
their
heads
and
necks
flat
on
the
ground
making
them
appear
as
a
mound
of
earth
from
a
distance


this
even
works
for
the
males
as
they
hold
their
wings
and
tail
low
so
that
the
heat
haze
of
the
hot
dry
air
that
often
occurs

aids
in

can
tolerate

in

vary

territorial
males
hiss
and
use
other
sounds
to
claim
mating
rights
over
a
harem
of
two
to
seven
hens


fights
usually
last
just
minutes
but
they
can
easily
cause
death
through
slamming
their
heads
into
opponents


the
successful
male
will
then
be
allowed
to
breed
with
all
the
females
in
an
area
but
will
only
form
a
pair
bond
with
the
dominant
female


the
females
lay
their
fertilized
eggs
in
a
single
<collocation>communal nest</collocation>
a
simple
pit
convert

in

and

ft
wide
scraped
in
the
ground
by
the
male


the
dominant
female
lays
her
eggs
first
and
when
it
is
time
to
cover
them
for
incubation
she
discards
extra
eggs
from
the
weaker
females
leaving
about
in
most
cases


ostrich
eggs
are
the
largest
of
all
eggs
and
by
extension
the
yolk
is
the
largest
single
cell
though
they
are
actually
the
smallest
eggs
relative
to
the
size
of
the
adult
bird


on
average
they
are
convert
cm
in
long
convert
cm
in
wide
and
weigh

kg
lb
over
times
the
weight
of
a
chicken
egg


the
eggs
are
incubated
by
the
females
by
day
and
by
the
males
by
night


this
uses
the
colouration
of
the
two
sexes
to
escape
detection
of
the
nest
as
the
<collocation>drab female</collocation>
blends
in
with
the
sand
while
the
black
male
is
nearly
undetectable
in
the
night


the
<collocation>incubation period</collocation>
is
to
days


males
and
females
cooperate
in
rearing
chicks


the
male
defends
the
and
teaches
them
to
feed


the
survival
rate
is
low
for
the
with
an
average
of
one
per
nest
surviving
to
adulthood


predators
when
threatened
the
ostrich
will
either
hide
itself
by
lying
flat
against
the
ground
or
will
run
away


if
cornered
it
can
attack
with
a
kick
from
its
powerful
legs


common
predators
of
nests
and
young
ostriches
include
jackals
various
birds
of
prey
mongoose
and
vultures


animals
that
prey
on
ostriches
of
all
ages
include
cheetahs
lions
leopards
african
dogs
and
spotted
hyena


ostriches
can
often
outrun
their
predators
in
a
pursuit
and
can
even
cheetahs
over
long
distances


however
they
may
sometimes
fight
fiercely
against
predators
especially
when
chicks
are
being
defended


they
have
sometimes
killed
lions
in
such
fights


evolution
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
are
not
a
group
because
they
are
not
descended
from
a
single
ancestor


that
means
the
of
the
group
is
going
to
change
and
they
will
not
all
be
placed
in
the
order
as
they
have
been


however
as
have
not
yet
agreed
on
a
new
classification
for
the
time
being
the
useful
term
is
still
used


unusual
morphology
ostriches
are
likely
to
be
placed
alone
in
the
order


they
have
a
number
of
peculiarities
which
suggest
a
separate
evolution
from
the
rest
of
the


they
lack
a
gallbladder


they
have
three
stomachs
and
the
caecum
is
convert
cm
in
on
long


unlike
all
other
living
birds
the
ostrich
secretes
uric
acid
separately
from
faeces


unlike
all
other
birds
who
store
the
uric
acid
and
faeces
together
and
excrete
them
together
ostriches
store
the
faeces
at
the
end
of
their
rectum


they
also
have
<collocation>unique pubic</collocation>
bones
that
are
fused
to
hold
their
gut


unlike
most
birds
the
males
have
a
penis
which
is
retractable
and
convert
in
cm
on
long


their
palate
bone
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
differs
from
other


ostriches
and
humans
ostriches
are
farmed
in
several
countries


they
used
to
be
prized
for
their
feathers
but
are
now
farmed
for
their
meat
and
eggs


their
skin
can
also
be
used
to
make
leather


in
south
africa
hunters
can
get
one
group
of
feathers
from
one
<collocation>wild ostrich</collocation>


when
they
are
farmed
every
seven
or
eight
months
farmers
can
take
groups
of
feathers
from
the
ostriches


they
will
grow
back
and
can
be
collected
again
a
in
seven
or
eight
more
months


when
threatened
ostriches
run
away
but
they
can
cause
serious
injury
and
death
with
kicks
from
their
powerful
legs


their
legs
can
only
kick
forward


ostriches
reared
entirely
by
humans
may
not
direct
their
<collocation>courtship behavior</collocation>
at
other
ostriches
but
toward
their
<collocation>human keepers</collocation>


ostriches
live
to
years
on
average


it
is
sometimes
said
that
ostriches
will
hide
their
heads
in
the
ground
when
they
are
scared
but
this
is
not
true


racing
a
jacksonville
florida
man
with
an
cart
circa
in
some
countries
people
race
each
other
on
the
back
of
ostriches


the
practice
is
common
in
africa
and
is
relatively
unusual
elsewhere


the
ostriches
are
ridden
in
the
same
way
as
horses
with
<collocation>special saddles</collocation>
reins
and
bits


however
they
are
harder
to
manage
than
horses
