l
l
derm
acne
is
an
infection
of
the
skin
caused
by
changes
in
the
sebaceous
glands


the
most
common
form
of
acne
is
called
acne
which
means
common
acne


the
redness
comes
from
the
inflammation
of
the
skin
in
response
to
the
infection


oils
from
the
glands
combine
with
dead
skin
cells
to
block
<collocation>hair follicles</collocation>


under
the
blocked
pore
oil
builds
up


skin
bacteria
can
then
grow
very
quickly


this
infection
makes
the
skin
become
swollen
and
red
which
becomes
visible


the
face
chest
back
and
upper
arms
are
most
common
places
for
acne
to
happen


acne
is
common
during
puberty
when
a
person
is
turning
from
a
child
into
an
adult
because
of
high
levels
of
hormones


acne
becomes
less
common
as
people
reach
adulthood

effects
of
acne
people
of

can
get

it
occurs
more
commonly
in
adolescents

can

people
physically
psychologically
and
socially

<collocation>psychological effects</collocation>
people
suffering
from
a
bad
case
of
acne
especially
adolescents
can
develop
low
which
can
lead
to
depression


social
effects
low
issues
can
make
a
person
suffering
from
acne
withdraw
from
many
social
events


it
makes
developing
new
personal
relationships
especially
love
relationships
more
difficult


low
can
also
cause
problems
with
<collocation>career advancement</collocation>
as
the
person
may
find
it
difficult
to
present
a
positive
attitude


this
may
sometimes
even
lead
to
suicide


causes
of
acne
exactly
why
some
people
get
acne
and
some
do
not
is
not
completely
known


these
can
cause
acne
or
make
it
worse
hormonal
fluctuation
hyperactive
sebaceous
glands
stress
many
dead
skin
cells
staying
on
the
skin
bacteria
in
the
pores
skin
irritation
or
scratching
of
any
<collocation>sort aspirin</collocation>
reduces
inflammation
which
in
result
reduces
facial
redness
due
to
acne


<collocation>acne myths</collocation>
there
are
many
incorrect
ideas
about
the
causes
for
acne


many
people
believe
these
false
ideas
diet


it
is
possible
that
eating
different
foods
can
help
clear
acne
for
some
people


but
the
relationship
between
food
and
acne
has
not
been
proven


chocolate
chips
sugar
milk
seafood
and
other
food
do
not
cause
acne


the
effect
of
diet
varies
from
person
to
person
no
scientific
evidence
has
been
brought
forth
to
prove
or
disprove
that
diet
has
any
effect
on
acne


some
people
think
that
both
celibacy
no
sex
and
masturbation
are
causes
for
acne


this
is
not
true


although
sexual
activity
produces
hormonal
changes
in
our
bodies
these
are
completely
normal
and
should
have
no
effect
on
acne


treatments
many
things
are
sold
to
treat
acne
the
most
popular
being
peroxide


many
of
these
things
have
not
been
scientifically
proven
to
help
acne


however
a
mix
of
commercial
and
homemade
treatments
can
help
with
acne
for
various
reasons


killing
the
bacteria
that
grow
in
the
blocked
follicles


this
can
be
done
by
ingesting
antibiotic
medication
or
by
putting
antibiotics
on
the
skin


<collocation>antibiotics act</collocation>
quickly
and
are
a
powerful
way
of
temporarily
getting
rid
of
acne


when
the
body
develops
a
resistance
to
the
antibiotics
the
bacteria
returns
stronger
than
before


removing
oil
on
the
skin
can
be
done
by
taking
drugs
that
contain
vitamin
a


is
the
name
of
the
most
famous
treatment
using
massive
quantities
of
vitamin
removing
dead
skin
cells
can
be
done
by
treatment
with
salicylic
acid


this
encourages
the
skin
to
peel
away
the
top
layer
of
cells


popping
a
pimple
should
not
be
done
by
anyone
but
a
qualified
dermatologist


pimple
popping
irritates
skin
can
make
the
bacteria
spread
and
can
cause
scars


if
you
must
pop
a
pimple
yourself
it
is
advised
to
apply
warm
water
to
the
area
before
popping
it
and
to
wash
your
hand
thoroughly
before
beginning
so
as
to
avoid
spreading
bacteria
via
the
hands


applying
hot
water
will
open
up
the
pores
and
reduce
the
damage
because
it
will
require
less
force
to
pop
it

are

dinosaurs
were
a
varied
group
of
animals


paleontologists
have
identified
over
different
genera
and
species
of
dinosaurs


their
descendants
the
birds
number
living
species
and
are
the
most
diverse
group
of
land
vertebrates


the
largest
dinosaurs
were
such
as
apatosaurus
and
brachiosaurus


they
were
the
largest
animals
to
ever
walk
on
dry
land


other
had
special
weapons
to
help
them
fight
off
the


for
example
triceratops
had
three
horns
on
its
head
shield
was
covered
in
boney
plates
and
stegosaurus
had
spikes
on
its
tail


the
carnivores
were
bipedal
walked
on
their
back
legs
though
not
as
we
do


their
body
was
more
towards
the
horizontal
balanced
at
the
back
by
their
tail


some
were
very
large
like
tyrannosaurus
and
but
some
were
small
like


it
was
the
smaller
sized
that
may
have
evolved
into
birds


the
first
fossil
bird
archaeopteryx
had
a
skeleton
which
looked
much
like
that
of
a
dinosaur


life
<collocation>style locomotion</collocation>
dinosaurs
were
primitively
bipedal
their
<collocation>probable ancestors</collocation>
were
small
bipedal


the
date
of
the
early
dinosaur
genus
at
million
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
is
important


probably
resembles
the
common
ancestor
of
all
dinosaurs
its
traits
suggest
that
the
first
dinosaurs
were
small
bipedal
predators


the
discovery
of
primitive
types
in
middle
triassic
<collocation>strata supports</collocation>
this
view


analysis
of
their
fossils
suggests
that
the
animals
were
indeed
small
bipedal
predators


hip
joints
and
postures
those
dinosaurs
which
returned
to
stance
kept
all
four
legs
under
their
body


this
is
much
more
efficient
than
the
sprawling
legs
of
a
lizard


the
big
could
never
have
reached
so
large
a
size
without
their
legs


warm
blooded
a
major
change
in
outlook
came
in
the
when
it
was
realized
that
small
theropods
were
probably


the
question
of
whether
all
theropods
or
even
all
dinosaurs
were
warm
blooded
is
still
undecided


it
is
now
certain
from
fossils
discovered
in
china
see
that
small
theropods
had
feathers


this
fits
well
with
the
idea
that
they
were
and
that
the
origin
of
birds
can
be
traced
to
a
line
of
small
theropods


activity
warm
blooded
animals
have
a
high
<collocation>metabolic rate</collocation>
use
up
food
faster


they
can
be
more
active
and
for
longer
than
animals
who
depend
on
the
environment
for
heating


therefore
the
idea
of
dinosaurs
insulated
by
feathers
led
to
the
idea
that
they
were
more
active
intelligent
and
faster
runners
than
previously
thought


palaeontologists
have
followed
this
view
for
small
theropods
but
not
for
larger
herbivores
