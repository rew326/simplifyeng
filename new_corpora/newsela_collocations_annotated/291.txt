in
some
areas
there
are
a
different
number
of
seasons


for
example
australia
northern
territory
has
six
seasons


in
places
which
are
tropical
and
there
are
two
seasons
the
rainy
or
wet
or
monsoon
season
and
the
dry
season


this
is
because
the
rain
changes
more
than
the
temperature


summer
is
a
warm
season
because
the
days
are
longer
and
the
sun
is
high
in
the
sky
giving
direct
light
to
the
ground


winter
is
a
cold
season
because
the
days
are
shorter
and
the
sun
is
low
in
the
sky
giving
indirect
light
to
the
ground


both
the
changes
in
the
length
of
the
day
and
the
height
of
the
sun
at
noon
are
caused
by
the
tilt
of
the
earth
spin
axis
with
respect
to
the
plane
of
the
earth
path
around
the
sun


at
any
time
in
any
season
the
northern
and
southern
hemispheres
halves
of
the
earth
have
opposite
seasons


seasons
dates
the
date
at
which
each
season
begins
is
different
in
different
countries


in

united

people
say
the

the
<collocation>summer solstice</collocation>
is
the
longest
day
of

and
the
<collocation>winter solstice</collocation>

the
equinox
is

same
number

was
avoided
when
the
spanish
armada
was
turned
away
at

however
the

was

altered
to

map
of
atlantis
here
seen
in
the
middle
of
the
atlantic
ocean


the
map
is
oriented
with
south
at
the
top


atlantis
is
a
name
for
a
fictional
large
island
or
small
continent
that
supposedly
had
been
in
the
atlantic
ocean
many
years
before
it
sank
into
the
depth
of
the
sea
and
vanished
within
a
day
and
a
night


the
story
of
atlantis
first
appears
in
the
stories
and
by
the
greek
philosopher
plato


in
all
of
his
books
plato
used
many
interesting
stories
to
help
explain
his
ideas
about
government
and
philosophy


no
other
ancient
writer
gave
specific
details
about
atlantis
until
after
plato
wrote
so
most
people
today
think
that
plato
just
made
up
this
story


after
plato
the
idea
of
atlantis
was
mostly
forgotten
until
when
a
writer
named
wrote
a
book
saying
that
atlantis
was
real
and
that
the
culture
of
atlantis
had
started
many
other
ancient
cultures
such
as
the
egyptian
and
mayan


after
book
many
people
became
interested
in
atlantis
and
began
to
say
that
it
had
aircraft
submarines
powerful
energy
crystals
and
other
things
that
are
not
known
from
ancient
times


by
studying
the
types
of
rock
that
are
found
in
the
bottom
of
the
atlantic
ocean
scientists
are
sure
that
there
was
never
really
any
large
island
or
small
continent
there
so
many
people
today
think
that
plato
may
have
heard
a
story
about
another
place
and
moved
it
to
the
atlantic
ocean
in
his
book


different
people
have
thought
that
many
places
all
over
the
world
have
been
the
place
of
the
real
atlantis


it
is
also
said
that
it
was
sunk
to
the
depths
of
the
ocean
by
the
gods
as
punishment
for
the
inhabitants
immorality

adjectives
and
adverbs
can
be
comparative
in
english
and
some
other
languages


when
people
are
talking
about
two
or
more
nouns
they
can
compare
them
say
the
differences
between
them


the
word
which
explains
how
they
compare
is
called
the
comparative


they
can
also
compare
actions
using
adverbs


examples
the
comparative
is
in
bold


john
is
tall
but
mark
is
taller
an
hour
is
longer
than
a
minute


many
words
can
be
made
into
a
comparative
by
adding
er
to
the
end
of
the
word


cool
cooler
big
bigger
wet
<collocation>wetter dark</collocation>
darker
words
that
end
with
the
letter
y
can
still
be
made
into
a
comparative
but
people
change
the
y
to
an
i
and
then
add
er


happy
happier
fluffy
fluffier
angry
angrier
costly
some
words
can
not
be
made
into
a
comparative
by
adding
er
instead
we
use
the
word
more
in
front


most
of
these
words
have
three
or
more
syllables
such
as
beautiful
reliable


if
people
are
not
sure
about
a
word
it
is
always
acceptable
to
say
more
something
such
as
more
beautiful
more
expensive


warning
the
er
ending
and
the
word
more
together
can
not
be
used
