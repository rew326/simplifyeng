they
also
take

are
filled
with
haemoglobin


this
is
a
protein


it
is
made
to
carry
a
large
amount
of
oxygen


haemoglobin
has
iron
in
it


the
iron
and
oxygen
gives
haemoglobin
its
red
color


this
is
why
blood
is
red


promotes
the
creation
of
red

blood
type

are
carried
on
the
surface

are
a

buffer
means
that
it
stops
changes
in


the

the
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
in
the
are
buffers
for
the

if
you
do
not
have

red
<collocation>blood cells</collocation>
you
will
die


white
<collocation>blood cells</collocation>
white
<collocation>blood cells</collocation>
are
a
big
part
of
the
immune
system


they
attack
things
that
do
not
belong
in
the
body


they
kill
germs
such
as
bacteria
and
viruses


they
kill
cancer
cells


white
<collocation>blood cells</collocation>
also
help
to
fight
other
toxic
substances


white
<collocation>blood cells</collocation>
find
where
the
germs
are
and
start
to
destroy
them


arrive
in
the
blood


they
also
go
out
of
the
blood
in
places
where
there
is
infection


do
this
to
fight
the
germs
that
make
the
infection


if
they
go
out
of
the
blood
to
fight
an
infection
they
may
return
in
the
lymphatic
system


so
are
in
lymph
nodes


another
name
for
white

cell
is
leukocyte


means
white

an

there
are
three
main
kinds
of


they
are
lymphocytes
and


some
of
the
mature
into
cells
which
do
similar
work
in
the
tissues


the
different
work
in
different
ways


some
kill
and
eat
germs
and
cancer
cells


some
make
antibodies


these
are
proteins
that
stick
to
a
cell
and
tell
other
to
kill
it


some
make
chemicals


they
release
these
chemicals
to
fight
things
that
do
not
belong
in
the
body


these
chemicals
cause
inflammation
in
a
part
of
the
body


when
a
germ
makes
someone
sick
the
body
shows
it


if
a
bacteria
gets
under
someone
skin
and
causes
an
infection
the
skin
gets
red
hot
and
painful


this
redness
heat
and
pain
are
signs
of
inflammation


this
shows
that
are
fighting
the
infection
and
killing
the
bacteria


platelets
platelets
help
make
<collocation>blood clot</collocation>


a
clot
is
when
the
liquid
blood
becomes
solid


the
body
makes
<collocation>blood clot</collocation>
when
the
skin
is
cut


this
stops
blood
from
going
out
of
the
skin
too
much


for
blood
to
be
able
to
clot
is
essential


but
rarely
some
blood
clots
are
bad


if
a
<collocation>blood clot</collocation>
happens
in
a
blood
vessel
going
to
the
brain
it
can
cause
a
stroke


if
it
happens
in
a
blood
vessel
going
to
the
heart
it
can
cause
a
heart
attack


this
does
not
usually
happen
to
young
healthy
people


platelets
are
not
the
only
things
that
make
clots


there
are
proteins
in
the
blood
that
help
make
clots


both
platelets
and
clotting
proteins
are
needed
to
make
good
clots


where
does
blood
come
from


illustration
of
bone
marrow
cells
from
gray
anatomy
<collocation>blood cells</collocation>
are
made
in
the
bone
marrow
and
in
the
spleen


the
bone
marrow
is
the
soft
material
in
the
middle
of
bones


special
cells
in
the
bone
marrow
make
most
of
the
<collocation>blood cells</collocation>
in
your
body


plasma
proteins
are
made
mostly
by
the
liver


the
water
and
electrolytes
in
plasma
come
from
the
food
and
water
that
you
eat


although
blood
is
a
fluid
in
some
respects
it
is
a
kind
of
connective
tissue


its
cells
originate
in
bone
marrow
and
the
spleen
and
in
the
blood
there
are
potential
molecular
fibers
in
the
form
of
fibrinogen


these
are
activated
when
a
<collocation>blood clot</collocation>
forms
