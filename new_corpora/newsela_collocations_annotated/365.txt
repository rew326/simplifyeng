a
judge
is
a
person
who
is
in
control
of
a
court
of
law


the
way
to
become
a
judge
depends
on
each
country


in
some
countries
judges
must
work
with
the
law
often
as
a
lawyer
for
a
number
of
years
before
they
can
sit
as
a
judge
in
a
courtroom


juries

used

many
countries
but
not
for
all
cases


the
modern

trial
first
developed
in

england
during
the
reign
of

ii


the
details
differ
between

if
there
is
a
jury
the
judge
has
the
job
of
making
sure
the
person
taken
to
court
is
treated
in
a
fair
way


some
courts
will
have
more
than
one

length
is
a
property
of
a
thing
that
can
be
measured


one
of
the
methods
of
measurement
is
either
using
a
ruler
or
a
<collocation>geometric square</collocation>


we
generally
measure
the
length
of
small
shapes
but
we
have
made
a
range
of
sizes
so
you
can
either
have
an
easy
to
go
degree
of
accuracy
or
an
close
to
exact
measurement
in
millimeters
or
even
more
accurate
ways
of
saying
that
length
the
more
longer
the
object
seems
the
lesser
the
degree
of
accuracy
we
tend
to
measure
it


the
length
of
something
is
the
distance
between
two
ends
of
the
thing


short
means
of
small
length


long
means
of
much
length


short
and
long
are
opposites


for

things
length
is
usually
the

side
of
measurement

the
weight
of
an
object
or
the
weight
of
an
amount
of
matter
is
the
measure
of
the
intensity
of
the
force
imposed
on
this
object
by
the
local
gravitational
field


weight
should
not
be
confused
with
the
related
but
quite
different
concept
of
mass


for
small
objects
on
earth
the
weight
force
is
directed
towards
the
center
of
the
planet


for
larger
objects
such
as
the
moon
orbiting
around
the
earth
the
force
is
directed
towards
the
center
of
mass
of
the
combined
system


in
common
language
the
weight
of
something
is
typically
understood
to
be
the
value
measured
at
or
near
the
earth
surface


unfortunately
the
common
terms
used
to
describe
the
weight
of
an
object
are
units
of
mass
such
as
kilograms
or
pounds


for
almost
all
of
human
history
weight
has
been
measured
on
the
surface
of
the
earth


here
the
weight
is
proportional
to
the
mass


objects
which
have
the
same
mass
have
the
same
weight


an
object
with
the
twice
the
mass
of
another
will
also
have
twice
the
weight


as
a
consequence
it
is
common
practice
to
use
the
two
words
mass
and
weight
as
if
they
mean
the
same
thing
and
to
use
kilograms
and
pounds
as
the
units
for
both
mass
and
weight


using
the
same
terms
to
describe
and
measure
the
two
different
properties
has
lead
to
confusion
between
these
two
properties
mass
and
weight


mass
and

are
not
the

measuring
weight
the
weight
of
an
object
or
of
an
amount
of
matter
is
typically
measured
with
an
instrument
such
as
a
spring
scale


the
scale
includes
a
spring
which
provides
a
force
to
oppose
the
gravitational
force
on
the
object
which
is
being
weighed


the
gravitational
force
pulls
down
the
spring
pushes
or
<collocation>pulls upwards</collocation>


typically
the
scale
has
a
readout
which
gives
not
the
weight
which
is
a
force
but
rather
the
mass
of
the
object


spring
scales
are
made
with
the
assumption
that
they
are
being
used
on
the
surface
of
the
earth


if
a
spring
scale
was
taken
to
the

it
would
give

reading

in
the
same
gravitational
field
it
determines
whether
one
object
is
heavier
or
lighter
than
the
other


weight
is
variable
weight
is
not
an
<collocation>intrinsic property</collocation>
of
matter
because
the
local
gravitational
field
that
generates
the
force
called
weight
is
variable
in
space
and
time
since
the
earth
<collocation>attraction decreases</collocation>
as
the
square
of
the
distance
to
its
center
the
weight
of
an
object
is
slightly
smaller
at
high
altitude
at
the
top
of
a
mountain
than
at
sea
level
or
at
the
equator
than
at
the
poles
because
the
earth
is
slightly
bulging


an
arbitrary
object
on
earth
is
also
attracted
by
all
other
<collocation>celestial bodies</collocation>
such
as
the
moon
for
instance


hence
its
weight
will
be
less
with
the
<collocation>moon overhead</collocation>
than
with
the
moon
on
the
other
side
of
the
earth


weight
is
not
defined
exclusively
to
earth
an
astronaut
weighs
times
less
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
than
on
the
surface
of
the
earth


weightlessness
is
an
apparent
condition
experienced
by
astronauts
or
satellites
in
orbit
around
a
planet


in
reality
their
weight
gravitational
pull
is
the
force
that
keeps
them
in
orbit


objects
in
orbit
travel
with
very
high
speed


for
satellites
orbiting
kilometres
above
the
earth
this
speed
is
about
kph


without
the
gravitational
pull
of
the
earth
they
would
fly
off
in
a
straight
line


the
gravitational
pull
keeps
them
falling
towards
the
planet


the
combination
of
high
sideways
velocity
and
constant
pull
toward
the
center
of
the
earth
bends
their
path
so
they
stay
in
orbit
