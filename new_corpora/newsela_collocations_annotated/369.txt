state
capitol
people
from
omaha
tried
to
stop
the
move
by
renaming
lancaster
after
the
president
<collocation>abraham lincoln</collocation>


many
of
the
people
south
of
the
river
had
wanted
the
confederate
to
win
the
recent
civil
war


these
people
thought
that
the
legislature
would
not
approve
the
move
if
the
future
capital
were
named
after
lincoln


the
plan
did
not
work
as
lancaster
was
renamed
lincoln
and
also
became
the
state
capital
upon
nebraska
admission
to
the
union
on
march


the
people
either
liked
or
disliked
the
new
name
depending
on
how
they
felt
about
the
civil
war


the
capitol
at
night
nebraska
state
capitol
was
designed
by
bertram
and
constructed
between
and


the
capitol
building
is
a
skyscraper
topped
by
a
golden
dome


the
tower
is
crowned
by
a

statue
of
a
farmer
sowing
grain
on
a
pedestal
of
wheat
and
corn
to
represent
the
state
<collocation>agricultural heritage</collocation>

other

from

it
in

making
it
a

not
only
within
the
city
but
for

area


inside

are
many
paintings
and

murals
showing
native
american
heritage
and
the
history
and
culture
of

<collocation>nuclear fission</collocation>
diagram
shows
a
neutron
being
absorbed
by
a
uranium
nucleus
which
then
becomes
unstable
and
splits
into
two
new
atoms
with
release
of
energy
and
some
more
neutrons


<collocation>nuclear fission</collocation>
is
a
nuclear
process


it
is
when
an
atom
splits
apart
into
smaller
atoms


the
process
gives
off
a
lot
of
energy
and
is
used
in
nuclear
weapons
and
<collocation>nuclear reactors</collocation>


<collocation>nuclear fission</collocation>
was
discovered
in
december
by
the
german
nuclear
chemist
otto
and
his
assistant
fritz
in
berlin


an
atom
is
the
smallest
particle
which
makes
up
a
<collocation>chemical element</collocation>
hydrogen
oxygen
magnesium


all
atoms
are
very
small


a
small
ball
called
a
nucleus
is
at
the
center
of
every
atom


elements
which
have
large
nuclei
such
as
uranium
and
plutonium
can
be
made
to
fission


if
a
relatively
very
large
nucleus
is
hit
by
a
neutron
it
will
sometimes
become
unstable
and
break
into
two
pieces


when
the
nucleus
breaks
apart
or
it
releases
a
lot
of
energy
and
it
also
causes
some
more
neutrons
to
be
released


for
a
few
isotopes
one
such
fission
can
release
many
neutrons


if
those
neutrons
then
hit
other
atoms
they
will
make
the
other
atoms
split


this
can
happen
again
and
again


this
is
called
a
nuclear
and
it
can
release
huge
amounts
of
energy
very
quickly


the
amount
of
energy
released
by
a
nuclear
chain
reaction
is
measured
in
kilotons


one
kiloton
is
the
same
as
the
energy
of
one
thousand
tons
of
tnt
trinitrotoluene


<collocation>introductory video</collocation>
clip
on
<collocation>nuclear fission</collocation>


in
a
nuclear
bomb
this
must
happen
very
quickly
to
make
a
very
big
explosion


in
a
nuclear
reactor
this
must
happen
very
slowly
to
create
heat


in
a
reactor
the
heat
created
by
the
uranium
or
plutonium
atoms
when
they
fission
or
break
apart
boils
water
into
steam


this
can
be
used
to
power
a
generator
to
create
electricity
