moses

early
life
moses
was
born
of
the
levi
tribe


the
new
pharaoh
afraid
of
the
population
ordered
every
hebrew
boy
to
be
thrown
into
the
nile
river
but
let
every
girl
live


moses
mother
gave
birth
and
kept
him
secret
for
three
months


when
she
could
no
longer
keep
him
hidden
she
fashioned
a
basket
lined
with
tar
and
pitch
and
placed
him
in
the
reeds
along
the
riverbank
while
his
sister
miriam
kept
watch
from
a
distance


a
princess
of
pharaoh
went
down
to
the
nile
to
bathe


there
she
discovered
a
crying
baby
and
noticed
he
was
a
hebrew
child


joining
the
attendants
moses
sister
offered
to
find
a
hebrew
woman
to
nurse
the
baby
for
the
princess
who
agreed


bringing
moses
real
mother
the
princess
asked
her
to
be
the
baby
wet
nurse
for
which
she
was
paid


when
the
child
grew
older
she
took
him
to
pharaoh
daughter
who
named
him
moses
saying
i
drew
him
out
of
the
water


moses
grew
up
a
privileged
member
of
the
court


he
was
well
educated
academically
and
physically


he
taught
<collocation>combat tactics</collocation>
and
leadership


the
burning
bush
moses
fled
to
where
he
married
daughter


one
day
moses
was
tending
his
sheep
and
came
to
mount


god
angel
made
a
bush
burn
with
fire
but
it
did
not
burn
up


when
he
came
nearer
god
spoke
to
him
and
ordered
him
to
remove
his
shoes
as
he
was
on
holy
land


god
commanded
him
to
be
a
leader
for
the
and
bring
them
out
of
egypt


at
first
moses
did
not
want
to
do
it
and
said
that
he
was
not
good
with
words
but
god
commanded
him
and
gave
aaron
his
brother
to
speak
for
him


moses
return
to
egypt
and
told
the
elders
what
happened


moses
and
the
pharaoh
moses
then
went
to
the
pharaoh
and
asked
him
to
let
the
go


however
the
pharaoh
did
not
agree


finally
god
inflicted
ten
plagues
upon
the
egyptians
before
pharaoh
agreed
to
release
the


the
last
plague
was
the
killing
of
all
both
human
and
animals


however
to
save
the
they
were
instructed
to
mark
their
doors
with
blood
from
a
lamb
which
is
an
allusion
to
<collocation>jesus christ</collocation>
shedding
his
blood
to
save
mankind
in
the
new
testament
so
that
the
avenging
angel
would
see
it
and
know
to
pass
over
that
house


the
pharaoh
finally
decided
to
let
the
go
who
then
migrated
in
large
numbers
from
egypt


the
pharaoh
later
changed
his
mind
and
followed
moses
and
his
people
with
an
army
to
attack
them


but
moses
made
the
red
sea
to
part
and
give
way
for
to
pass


the
were
safe
but
the
pharaoh
army
was
destroyed


journey
in
the
wilderness
moses
led
the
through
the
wilderness
and
god
gave
them
manna
and
quails
to
eat
and
water
from
rocks
to
drink


he
also
caused
the
to
lose
in
a
battle


when
moses
came
to
mount
he
went
up
to
receive
the
ten
commandments
and
other
laws
from
god


the
ten
commandments
were
written
by
god
on
two
tablets


god
also
told
him
the
instructions
of
the
priests
duties


moses
was
up
the
mountain
for
forty
days
and
forty
nights


when
the
people
waited
for
moses
and
did
not
find
him
they
made
aaron
his
brother
make
a
calf
out
of
gold
and
worshiped
it


god
warned
moses
about
it
and
when
moses
came
down
and
saw
what
they
did
he
was
so
angry
that
the
tablets
fell
and
they
smashed
into
pieces


the
people
of
levi
tribes
are
commanded
to
kill
people
who
worshiped
the
calf


later
on
moses
asked
god
to
forgive
the
people


god
wrote
for
moses
two
more
tablets
and
put
them
in
the


moses
also
asked
craftsmen
to
make
the
tabernacle
as
god
wanted


moses
is
founder
of
basis
of
the
philosophy
of
law
as
well
as
such
modern
<collocation>legal doctrines</collocation>
as
independent
judiciary
and
separation
of
powers


later
life
while
the
were
wandering
around
the
wilderness
moses
was
the
one
whom
god
spoke
to


however
the
people
kept
complaining
about
the
hardships


god
instructed
moses
to
send
twelve
spies
to
scout
the
land
god
is
giving
to
them
however
some
of
them
became
afraid
because
the
people
living
there
looked
stronger
and
more
powerful
than
they


they
told
the
others
not
to
go
there


only
joshua
son
of
nun
and
son
of
reported
the
truth
as
god
wanted


god
decided
because
of
this
that
the
would
wander
forty
years
in
the
wilderness
and
every
one
except
joshua
and
from
that
generation
would
die
without
seeing
the
promised
land


god
gave
many
laws
to
the
through
moses


moses
made
joshua
take
over
him
before
he
died


moses
died
before
he
reached
canaan
the
land
god
was
leading
his
people
to


he
was
years
old
when
he
died


today
jews
around
the
world
follow
the
laws
of
the
ten
commandments
and
the
torah
that
god
gave
to
them
through
moses


he
is
also
believed
to
be
a
prophet
by
muslims


the
historical
moses
the
bible
the
torah
and
the
have
references
to
a
person
called
moses
in
them


the
name
they
give
to
the
person
varies


other
people
also
have
written
about
moses


these
include
and


it
is
not
known
how
much
these
descriptions
have
taken
from
earlier
sources
which
may
now
have
been
lost


an
existing
earlier
source
is
the
papyrus
which
records
the
events
of
the
ten
plagues


no
other
written
records
from
countries
such
as
egypt
or
assyria
have
been
found
that
are
from
before
about
and
that
tell
about
the
stories
of
the
bible
or
its
main
characters


there
is
no
known
physical
evidence
such
as
pottery
shards
or
stone
tablets
to
say
that
moses
really
existed


pharaohs
have
ordered
the
destruction
of
records
that
put
them
into
a
bad
light


several
from
monuments
have
also
been
destroyed
in
different
of
ancient
egyptian
history


it
looks
like
the
story
written
about
moses
in
the
bible
has
two
different
sources


there
were
two
groups
of
people
who
told
the
story


the
two
stories
were
passed
on
separately


only
later
were
they
combined
into
the
version
that
can
now
be
found
in
the
bible


passing
on
the
stories
from
one
generation
to
the
next
has
perhaps
also
introduced
inaccuracies


some
people
added
things
to
the
story
when
they
told
it


they
also
omitted
other
things


criticism
according
to
the
torah
moses
ordered
the
<collocation>death penalty</collocation>
for
many
offences


he
also
had
defeated
enemies
killed


jews
christians
and
muslims
consider
him
to
be
a
holy
figure


for
this
reason
criticism
of
these
passages
of
the
hebrew
bible
has
been
left
to
others


in
the
late
eighteenth
century
for
example
the
thomas
paine
commented
at
length
on
moses
laws
in
the
age
of
reason


paine
also
gave
his
view
that
the
character
of
moses
as
stated
in
the
bible
is
the
most
horrid
that
can
be
imagined
giving
the
story
at
numbers
as
an
example


in
the
<collocation>nineteenth century</collocation>
the
agnostic
robert
wrote
that
all
the
ignorant
infamous
heartless
hideous
things
recorded
in
the
inspired
are
not
the
words
of
god
but
simply
some
mistakes
of
moses


in
the
the
atheist
richard
referring
to
the
same
passage
like
paine
concluded
no
moses
was
not
a
great
role
model
for
modern
moralists
