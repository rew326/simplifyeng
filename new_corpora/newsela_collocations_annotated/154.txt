the
fossils
show
that
small
theropod
dinosaurs
had
feathers


these
deposits
have
preserved
them
so
well
that
the
impressions
of
their
feathers
can
be
clearly
seen


this
leads
us
to
think
that
feathers
evolved
first
as
heat
insulation
and
only
later
for
flight


the
origin
of
birds
lies
in
these
small
<collocation>feathered dinosaurs</collocation>


palaeontologists
now
agree
that
birds
evolved
from
group
of
dinosaurs


this
explains
why
some
consider
birds
to
be
living

some
birds
are
eaten
as
food


most
usually
it
is
the
chicken
and
its
eggs
but
people
often
also
eat
geese
pheasants
turkeys
and
ducks


other
birds
are
sometimes
eaten
are
emus
ostriches
pigeons
grouse
quails
doves
and
even
songbirds


some
species
have
died
out
because
they
have
been
hunted
for
food
for
example
the
dodo
and
the
passenger
pigeon


many
species
have
learned
how
to
get
food
from
people


the
number
of
birds
of
these
species
has
grown
because
of
it


seagulls
and
crows
find
food
from
garbage
dumps


the
common
pigeon
columba
sparrows
passer
and
starlings
live
in
large
numbers
in
towns
and
cities
all
over
the
world


sometimes
people
also
use
working
birds


for
example
homing
pigeons
carry
messages


nowadays
people
sometimes
race
them
for
sport


people
also
use
falcons
for
hunting
and
cormorants
for
fishing


in
the
past
people
in
mines
often
used
a
canary
to
see
if
there
were
bad
gas
methane
in
the
air


people
often
have
colorful
birds
such
as
parrots
and
as
pets


these
intelligent
birds
are
popular
because
they
can
copy
human
talking


because
of
this
some
people
trap
birds
and
take
them
to
other
countries
to
sell


this
is
not
usually
allowed
these
days


most
pet
birds
are
specially
bred
and
are
sold
in
pet
shops


people
can
catch
some
bird
diseases
for
example
psittacosis
newcastle
disease
influenza
and


in
there
was
an
epidemic
of
bird
influenza
spreading
through
some
parts
of
the
world
often
called
avian
flu


some
people
have
in
their
gardens
to
give
birds
a
place
to
nest
and
bird
tables
where
birds
can
get
food
and
water
in
very
cold
or
very
dry
weather


this
lets
people
see
some
small
birds
close
up
which
are
normally
hidden
away
in

freedom
of
speech
is
the
right
to
state
one
opinions
and
ideas
without
being
stopped
or
punished


sometimes
this
is
also
called
freedom
of
expression


freedom
of
speech
is
thought
to
also
include
freedom
of
information


however
new
laws
are
usually
needed
to
allow
information
to
be
used
easily


most
people
think
freedom
of
speech
is
necessary
for
a
democratic
government


in
countries
without
free
speech
people
might
be
afraid
to
say
what
they
think


then
the
government
does
not
know
what
the
people
want


if
the
government
does
not
know
what
they
want
it
can
not
respond
to
their
wants


without
free
speech
the
government
does
not
have
to
worry
as
much
about
doing
what
the
people
want


some
people
say
this
is
why
some
governments
do
not
allow
free
speech
they
do
not
want
to
be
criticised
or
they
fear
there
would
be
revolution
if
everyone
knew
everything
that
was
happening
in
the
country


a
<collocation>liberal thinker</collocation>
john
<collocation>stuart mill</collocation>
believed
that
freedom
of
speech
is
important
because
the
society
that
people
live
in
has
a
right
to
hear
people
ideas


it
not
just
important
because
everyone
should
have
a
right
to
express
him
or
herself


few
countries
with
free
speech
let
everything
be
said


for
example
the
united
states
<collocation>supreme court</collocation>
said
that
it
was
against
the
law
to
shout
fire
in
a
crowded
theater
if
there
is
no
fire
because
this
might
cause
people
to
panic


the
international
covenant
on
civil
and
political
rights
also
says
that
it
is
not
okay
to
cause
national
racial
or
religious
hatred


also
some
countries
have
laws
against
hate
speech

symptoms


different
uses
of
bananas
fibre
textiles
the
fiber
gained
from
the
banana
plant
has
been
used
to
make
textiles
for
a
long
time


in
japan
bananas
have
been
grown
to
be
used
for
clothing
and
in
the
house
since
at
least
the
century


in
the
japanese
system
the
leaves
and
shoots
are
cut
from
the
plant
periodically
to
make
sure
they
are
soft


the
harvested
shoots
must
first
be
boiled
in
lye
to
prepare
the
fibers
for
the
making
of
the
yarn


these
banana
shoots
produce
fibers
of
varying
degrees
of
softness


they
can
be
used
for
yarns
and
textiles
of
different
and
for
specific
uses


for
example
the
<collocation>outermost fibers</collocation>
of
the
shoots
are
the
they
are
good
for
tablecloths


the
softest
<collocation>innermost fibers</collocation>
are
desirable
for
kimono
and


this
traditional
japanese
banana
cloth
making
process
has
many
steps
all
performed
by
hand


another
system
is
used
in
nepal


there
the
trunk
of
the
banana
plant
is
harvested
instead


small
pieces
of
this
trunk
are
then
softened


the
fibers
are
extracted
mechanically
bleached
and
dried


they
are
then
sent
to
the
valley
where
rugs
are
produced


these
rugs
have
a
texture
and
general
qualities
similar
to
that
of
silk


these
<collocation>banana fiber</collocation>
rugs
are
woven
by
traditional
nepalese
methods


paper
<collocation>banana fiber</collocation>
is
also
used
