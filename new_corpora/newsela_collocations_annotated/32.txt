this
is
because
the
mass
within
a
galaxy
holds
the
galaxy
together
and
the
same
applies
to
the
groups
of
galaxies
such
as
our
<collocation>local group</collocation>


the
gravitation
is
produced
by
the
matter
and
energy
in
a
galaxy
or
group
of
galaxies


everything
in
a
galaxy
moves
around
a
center
and
that
is
also
an
effect
of
gravity


there
are
various
types
of
galaxies
elliptical
spiral
and
galaxies
which
can
all
be
with
or
without
bars


then
there
are
irregular
galaxies


all
galaxies
exist
inside
the
universe


there
are
probably
over
billion
galaxies
within
distance
we
can
see
or
the

the

uses
geometry
can
be
used
to
measure
the
area
and
perimeter
of
a
flat
shape


it
can
also
be
used
to
measure
a
solid
shape
volume
and
surface
area


geometry
can
be
used
to
measure
many
things
by
seeing
them
as
made
of
<collocation>geometrical shapes</collocation>


for
example
geometry
can
help
people
find
the
surface
area
of
a
house
so
they
can
buy
the
right
amount
of
paint
the
volume
of
a
box
to
see
if
it
is
big
enough
to
hold
a

of
food
the
area
of
a

so
it
can
be
divided

<collocation>origins geometry</collocation>
began
as
the
art
of
measuring
the
shape
of
land
so
that
it
could
be
shared
fairly
between
people


it
means
to
measure
the
land


it
has
grown
from
this
to
become
one
of
the
most
important
parts
of
mathematics


the
greek
mathematician
euclid
wrote
the
first
book
about
geometry


geometry
is
one
of
the
oldest
branches
of
mathematics


examples
geometry
starts
with
a
few
simple
ideas
that
are
thought
to
be
true
called
axioms


such
as
a
point
is
shown
on
paper
by
touching
it
with
a
pencil
or
pen
without
making
any
sideways
movement


we
know
where
the
point
is
but
it
has
no
size


a
straight
line
is
the
shortest
distance
between
two
points


for
example
pulls
a
piece
of
string
from
one
point
to
another
point


a
straight
line
between
the
two
points
will
follow
the
path
of
the
tight
string


a
plane
is
a
flat
surface
that
does
not
stop
in
any
direction


for
example
imagine
a
wall
but
extending
in
all
directions
infinitely

the
fusion
of
the
ideas
coming

with
those
coming
from

is
at
the
origin
of
a
part
of
the
standard

of

in
particular
the
term
graph
was
introduced
by
sylvester

published
in

one
of
the
most
famous
and
<collocation>productive problems</collocation>
of
<collocation>graph theory</collocation>
is
the

is
it
true
that
any

drawn

may
have
its
regions
colored
with
four
colors
in
such
a
way
that
any
two
regions
having
a
common
border
have
different
colors


this
problem
was
first
posed
by
francis
in
and
its
first
written
record
is
in
a
letter
of
de
morgan
addressed
to
hamilton
the
same
year


many
incorrect
proofs
have
been
proposed
including
those
by

others


the
study
and
the
generalization
of
this
problem
by
tait
and
led
to
the
study
of
the
colorings
of
the
<collocation>graphs embedded</collocation>
on
surfaces
with
<collocation>arbitrary genus</collocation>


tait
generated
a
new
class
of
problems
the
problems

studied
by
petersen

the
works

the
results

the

a
proof
produced
in

and
which
involved
checking
the
properties
of
configurations
by

was
not
fully
accepted
at
the
time
due
to
its
complexity


a

proof
considering
only
configurations
was
given
twenty
years
later
by

important
factor
of
common
development
of
<collocation>graph theory</collocation>
and
came
from
the
use
of
the
techniques
of
modern
algebra


the
first
example
of
such
a
use
comes
from
the
work
of

to
many
such
problems
exact
solutions
do
exist


many
times
however
they

approximations
are

history

including
records

and
artifacts
