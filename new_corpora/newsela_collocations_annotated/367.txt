a

do
not
buy

give
money
to
a
company


instead
of
buying
a
certain
product
they
might
also
buy
another
very
similar
product
from
a
different
company


the
word
was
made
during
the
irish

it

from

of
a

when
something
is
artificial
or
it
has
been
made
by
humans
not
nature


for
example
an
artificial
satellite
is
one
made
by
humans
while
a
natural
satellite
is
a
satellite
that
was
not
made
by
humans


many
artificial
things
imitate
or
copy
things
found
in
nature


the
imitation
may
use
the
same
basic
materials
as
those
in
the
natural
object
or
it
may
use
quite
different
materials


these
are
concepts
in
defining
reality


there
are
different
ideas
about
what
can
be
considered
artificial
and
what
is
natural


the
word
artificial
comes
from
the
latin
words
art
meaning
skill
and
to
make


artificial
does
not
necessarily
mean
synthetic
that
is
created
by
synthesis


an
artificial
sweetener
imitates
sweetness
using
a
chemical
formula
that
is
not
found
in
nature
it
is
therefore
both
artificial
and
synthetic

grew
up
he
found
a
gleaming
sword
stuck
in
a
stone
one
that
he
had
heard
about

many
tales


he
was
told
that
the
man

john
johnny
chapman
september
march
is
an
american
folk
hero


he
was
a
christian
missionary
and
pioneer


his
nickname
came
from
the
fact
that
he
planted
apple
trees
throughout
the
midwest
of
america


many
people
consider
him
an
early
conservationist
or


he
wandered
the
country
usually
barefoot
and
with
a
cooking
pot
on
his
head
for
most
of

adult
life
planting
apple
trees
teaching
the

telling

and
befriending
<collocation>native americans</collocation>
wild
animals
and
other

many
stories
have
been
told
about
him
and
his
journeys
as
well
as

him
a

some
time

but
just
when
he
embraced
the
faith
and
began
his
missionary
activities
we
can
not
be
sure
though
it
is
probable
that
it
was
before
he
ever
reached
western
pennsylvania


there
are
some
early
accounts
of
john
speaking
of
his
own
activities
as
a
bible
missionary
on
the
potomac
when
he
was
a
young

along
the
banks
of
the
potomac
in
eastern
virginia
picking
the
seeds
from
the
of
the
cider
mills
in
the
late


the
apple
seeds
that
johnny
obtained
were
free
as
the
cider
mills
wanted
there
to
be
more
apple
trees
planted
to
improve
their
business


at
the
time
of
his
death
johnny
left
an
estate
of
more
than
acres
of
nurseries

left
these
to
his

old


he
had
probably
come
up
the
river
to
plant
near
the
refugee
tract
which
would
soon
fill
up
with
settlers
when
congress
actually
got

the

had
ratified
resolutions

for
the
benefit
of
those
who
had
left
canada
and
nova
scotia
to
fight
against
the
british
in
the
revolutionary
war


the
lands
were
actually
set
apart
in

patents
issued
in


grants
of
land
ranging
from
acres
to

were
awarded
according
to
the

and
planted
his
nurseries
before
