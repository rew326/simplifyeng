is
the
name
for
the
economic
policies
that
introduced
to

it

in


war
communism
was
introduced
for
many
reasons


however
the
most
important
ones
were
to
feed
and
supply
the
hungry
red
army
of
bolsheviks
during
the
russian
civil
war
to
move
towards
complete
communism
it
was
bad
for
the
russian
economy
because
the
government
took
away
extra
grain
produced
by
the
peasants


this
was
known
as
grain
requisitioning


peasants
were
not
allowed
to
sell
their
extra
food
so
they
stopped
producing
more
than
they
needed
to
eat


this
created
a
russian
famine
with
millions
of
people
foodless
and
starving

<collocation>economic policy</collocation>
is
the
name
for
the
new
economy
introduced
by
lenin
after
the
failed
methods
of
war
communism


these
new
economic
policies
were
to
revive
the
russian
economy


the
new
policy
was
a
combination
of
<collocation>private enterprise</collocation>
and
state
socialism


this
is
because
the
people
did
not
believe
in
war
communism


the
new
economic
policies
meant
that
russia
returned
to
a
partly
capitalist
society


this
sorted
out
the
problems
of
mass
starvation
and
famine
which
war
communism
had
caused


lenin
did
not
want
russia
to
stay
in
this
way
he
only
introduced
them
to
be
supported
again
by
the
russian
people
and
to

foreign
aid
is
when

country

another

this
is
especially
needed
when
a

happens
in

sometimes
this

comes
from

and
sometimes
the

give
money


some
foreign

helps
by
giving
food

to

most
of
the
time

a

station
in

the
energy
of
falling
water
has
been
used
by
humans
for
thousands
of
years


is
electricity
that
is
made
by
the
movement
of
water


it
is
usually
made
with
dams
that
block
a
river
to
make
a
reservoir
or
collect
water
that
is
pumped
there


when
the
water
is
let
go
the
huge
pressure
behind
the
dam
forces
the
water
down
pipes
that
lead
to
a
turbine
this
causes
the
turbine
to
turn
which
turns
a
generator
which
makes
electricity


this
use
of
renewable
energy
produces
less
pollution
than

do

this
makes
it
useful
for
times
when
demand
for
electricity
is
high


water
that
has
been
stored
in
a

can
be
released
let
go
when

so
the

also

once
the

is

the
electricity
costs
very
little
no

produced
and
electricity
can
be
generated
whenever
wanted

turbines
do
not
have
a

but
instead
use

they
produce
less
electricity
and
can
not
store
energy
for
later
use


disadvantages
of
the
building
of
large
dams
to
hold
the
water
can
damage
the
environment


in
australian
government
stopped
the
tasmanian
state
government
from
building
a
dam
on
the
river
in
after

the

that
thinks

perceives
wills
and
feels


some
religious
people
think
that
mind
is
separate
from
the
body
and
is
called
a
soul
see
dualism


for
science
what
others
call
the
mind
is
entirely
caused
by
workings
of
the
brain


the
philosopher
gilbert
called
mind
the
ghost
in
the
machine
and
the
idea
that
it
was
separate
from
the
brain
was
the
mistaken
official
doctrine


many
people
argue
about
what
makes
up
the
mind


some
say
that
only
reason
and
memory
are
part
of
the
mind
because
they
are
conscious


in
this
view
the
emotions
like
love
hate
fear
and
joy
are
different
from
the
mind


some
people
with
this
view
say
the
emotions
are
part
of
the
heart


others
argue
that
our
rational
and
emotional
states
can
not
be
separated
and
should
all
be
part
of
what
we
call
the
mind

often

mind
to

history
of

of

memory

explains
the
sayings
call

come

keep

on


old

had

words
to

we
call

today
such
as
meaning
mind
spirit


the
word
mind
gradually
grew
to
mean
all
conscious

over
the
and
centuries


studying

of

is
when
we
absorb
what
happens
around
us
so
that
we
can
deal
with
it
effectively
according
to
our
plans
and
desires


thinking
is
using
information
like
forming
concepts
problem
solving

making
choices


memory
is
when

recall
it


imagination
is
the
ability
to
invent
worlds
inside
the
mind
complete
or
not


the
mind
makes
these
by
drawing
on
experience
in
the

world


consciousness
is
knowing
that
we
exist
and
the

exists

<collocation>health organization</collocation>
who
there
is
not
one
way
to
measure
<collocation>mental health</collocation>
in
all
people
because
there
are
many
things
in

that
might
make
what
is

healthier
different
from

person

another


in

most
experts
agree

<collocation>mental health</collocation>
and
<collocation>mental illness</collocation>
are
not

in

words
not
having
a
<collocation>mental illness</collocation>
does
not
mean
you
are
in

<collocation>mental health</collocation>


one
way
to
think
about
<collocation>mental health</collocation>
is
by
looking
at
how
well
a
person
lives


signs

<collocation>mental health</collocation>
include

philosophy
philosophy
of
mind
is
the
branch
of
philosophy
that
studies
the
nature
of
the
mind
and
how
it
is
linked
to
the
body


the
main
problem
is
how
the
mind
is
related
to
the
body
but
there
are
also
questions
about
the
nature
of
the
mind
that
do
not
talk
about
its
relation
to
the
physical
body


dualism
and
are
the
two
main
ways
people
try
to
solve
the
problem


dualism
is
when
people
believe
that
that
mind
and
body
are
in
some
way
separate
from
each
other


it
can
be
traced
back
to
plato
aristotle
and
the
and
yoga
schools
of
hindu
philosophy
but
it
was
most
precisely
formulated
by
descartes
in
the
century


is
the
belief
that
mind
and
body
are
not
physiologically
and
distinct
kinds
of
entities


this
view
was
first
seen
in
western
philosophy
by
in
the
century
and
was
later
held
by
the
rationalist


according
to
mind
and
body
are
two
parts
of
a
larger
being


idealists
think
that
the
mind
is
all
that
exists
and
that
the
outside
world
is
actually
made
up
by
the
mind


think
that
everything
can
be
expressed
by
what
is
physical


neutral
believe
that
everything
can
be
either
mental
or
physical
depending
how
you
see
it


for
example
a
red
spot
on
a
wall
is
physical
because
it
is
an
actual
thing
depending
on
the
physical
wall
but
it
is
mental
because
our
brain
responds
to
the
color


the
most
common
in
the
and
centuries
have
all
been
different
kinds
of
including


psychology
psychology
is
the
study
of
the
way
we
think
feel
and
act


it
involves
the
scientific
study
of
processes
such
as
perception
cognition
feelings
personality
as
well
as
things
around
us
that
might
affect
the
way
we
think


from
this
study
psychologists
try
to
form
rules
for
why
we
act
the
way
we
do


psychology
also
includes
using
this
knowledge
to
help
solve
problems
of
everyday
life
and
treat
<collocation>mental health</collocation>
problems

and

social
psychology
is
the
study
of
how
we
think
feel
and
act
in
groups
of
other
people

shelley
traveled
to
lake
geneva
to
spend
summer
near
the
famous
poet
lord
byron


in
terms
of
english
literature
it
was
a
great
summer


began
work
on
hymn
to
<collocation>intellectual beauty</collocation>
and
mont
blanc


at
the
same
time
mary
was
inspired
to
write
her
classic
work


one
evening
the
group
of
young
writers
decided
to
have
a
contest
telling
horror
stories


another
guest
dr
john
came
up
with
the
vampyre
later
a
strong
influence
on
stoker


other
guests
told
<collocation>scary stories</collocation>
but
mary
could
not
think
of
one


but
that
night
she
dreamt
of
the
story
she
had
wanted
to
tell


she
wrote
it
down
and
in
time
her
story
would
be
published
as
frankenstein
and
it
became
more
successful
than
any
of
the
other
writings
produced
that
summer


mary
had
a
number
of
different
sources
for
her
work
one
was
the
promethean
myth
from
ovid


the
influence
of
john
milton
paradise
lost
the
book
the
monster
finds
in
the
cabin
is
also
clearly
seen
in
the
novel


also
both
had
read
william


mary
and
were
both
vegetarians
and
strong
advocates
for
animal
rights


one
can
see
references
to
vegetarianism
in
her
writing


for
example
in
her
novel
frankenstein
the
monster
was
a
vegetarian

in
their
new

shelley
and
mary
were
married
now
with
blessing


their
attempts
to
gain
custody
of

the
sum
of
two
numbers
is
what
we
get
when
we
add
the
two
numbers
together


this
operation
is
called
summation


there
are
a
number
of
ways
of

sums

the
most

is
a
mathematical
notation
to
write
long
sums
in
a
short
way


<collocation>sigma notation</collocation>
uses
the
greek
<collocation>letter sigma</collocation>
and
takes
upper
and
<collocation>lower bounds</collocation>
which
tell
us
where
the
sum
begins
and
where
it
ends


the
lower
bound
usually
has
a
variable
called
the
index
given
a
value
such
as
i


this
tells
us
that
the
summation
begins
at
and
goes
up
by
until
it
reaches
the
number
on
the
