pots
in
a
rhythmic
way
they
are
making
a
simple
type
of
music


there
are
four
things
which
music
has
most
of
the
time
music
often
has
pitch


this
means
high
and
low
notes


tunes
are
made
of
notes
that
go
up
or
down
or
stay
on
the
same
pitch


music
often
has
rhythm


rhythm
is
the
way
the
musical
sounds
and
silences
are
put
together
in
a
sequence


every
tune
has
a
rhythm
that
can
be
tapped


music
usually
has
a
regular
beat


music
often
has
dynamics


this
means
whether
it
is
quiet
or
loud
or
somewhere
in
between


music
often
has
timbre


this
is
a
french
word
pronounced
the
french
way


the
timbre
of
a
sound
is
the
way
that
a
sound
is
interesting


the
sort
of
sound
might
be
harsh
gentle
dry
warm
or
something
else


timbre
is
what
makes
a
clarinet
sound
different
from
an
oboe
and
what
makes
one
person
voice
sound
different
from
another
person


definitions
there
is
no
simple
definition
of
music
which
covers
all
cases


it
is
an
art
form
and
opinions
comes
into
play


music
is
whatever
people
think
is
music


a
different
approach
is
to
list
the
qualities
music
must
have
such
as
sound
which
has
rhythm
melody
pitch
timbre


these
and
other
attempts
do
not
capture
all
aspects
of
music
or
leave
out
examples
which
definitely
are
music


according
to
thomas
music
is
a
certain
<collocation>reciprocal relation</collocation>
established
between
a
person
his
behavior
and
a
sounding
object


musical
experience
and
the
music
together
are
called
phenomena
and
the
activity
of
describing
phenomena
is
called


history
musicians
of
tomb
of
dynasty
western
even
in
the
stone
age
people
made
music


the
first
music
was
probably
made
trying
to
imitate
sounds
and
rhythms
that
occurred
naturally


human
music
may
echo
these
phenomena
using
patterns
repetition
and
tonality


this
kind
of
music
is
still
here
today


shamans
sometimes
imitate
sounds
that
are
heard
in
nature


it
may
also
serve
as
entertainment
games
or
have
practical
uses
like
luring
animals
when
hunting


some
animals
also
can
use
music


songbirds
use
song
to
protect
their
territory
or
to
attract
a
mate


monkeys
have
been
seen
beating
<collocation>hollow logs</collocation>


this
may
of
course
also
serve
to
defend
the
territory


the
first
musical
instrument
used
by
humans
was
probably
the
voice


the
human
voice
can
make
many
different
kinds
of
sounds


the
larynx
voice
box
is
like
a
wind
instrument


the
oldest
known
neanderthal
hyoid
bone
with
the
modern
human
form
was
found
in
indicating
that
the
neanderthals
had
language
because
the
<collocation>hyoid supports</collocation>
the
voice
box
in
the
human
throat


most
likely
the
first
rhythm
instruments
or
<collocation>percussion instruments</collocation>
involved
the
clapping
of
hands
stones
hit
together
or
other
things
that
are
useful
to
keep
a
beat


there
are
finds
of
this
type
that
date
back
to
the
paleolithic


some
of
these
are
ambiguous
as
they
can
be
used
either
as
a
tool
or
a
musical
instrument


the
first
flutes
the
<collocation>babe flute</collocation>
the
oldest
flute
ever
discovered
may
be
the
<collocation>babe flute</collocation>
found
in
the
slovenian
cave
