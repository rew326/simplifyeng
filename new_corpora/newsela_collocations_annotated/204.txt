the
ideas
about
the
locations
of
the
stars
and
sun
was
disproved
or
proved
to
not
be
true
in


the
person
who
first
thought
of
the
idea
about
the
earth
going
around
the
sun
was
nicholas
copernicus


galileo
galilei
and
johannes
two
other
scientists
helped
to
prove
that
copernicus
idea
was
right


they
looked
at
how
the
moons
of
some
planets
moved
in
the
sky
and
they
used
this
to
prove
copernicus
right


newton
also
wrote
a
book
about
gravity
which
helped
to
prove
copernicus
idea
right


hawking
also
talks
a
little
about
the
other
topics
things
in
the
book


chapter
this
is
a
light
cone


in
this
chapter
stephen
hawking
talks
about
space
and
time


he
describes
the
motion
of
planets
moving
around
the
sun
and
how
gravity
works
between
the
planets
and
the
sun


he
also
talks
about
the
ideas
of
absolute
rest
and
absolute
position


these
ideas
are
about
the
thought
that
events
stay
in
place
over
a
period
of
time


this
was
found
not
to
be
true
by
newton
laws
of
gravity


the
idea
of
absolute
rest
did
not
work
when
objects
move
very
fast
at
the
speed
of
light
or
light
speed


the
speed
of
light
was
found
out
in
by
the
danish
astronomer
ole
roemer


the
speed
of
light
was
found
to
be
very
fast
but
at
a
finite
speed


however
scientists
found
a
problem
when
they
tried
to
say
that
light
always
traveled
at
the
same
speed


the
scientists
created
a
new
idea
called
the
ether
which
tried
to
explain
light
speed


einstein
said
that
time
was
not
absolute
or
always
the
same


the
idea
of
the
ether
was
said
to
be
not
needed
by
another
scientist
albert
einstein


he
said
that
the
idea
of
the
ether
was
not
needed
if
another
idea
the
idea
of
absolute
time
or
time
that
is
always
the
same
was
dropped


einstein
idea
was
also
the
same
as
henry
idea


einstein
idea
is
called
the
theory
of
relativity


also
in
this
chapter
stephen
hawking
talks
about
light


he
says
that
events
can
be
described
by
light
broken
link
cone
cones


the
top
of
the
light
cone
tells
where
the
light
from
the
event
will
travel


the
bottom
tells
where
the
light
was
in
the
past


the
center
of
the
light
cone
is
the
event


besides
light
cones
stephen
hawking
also
talks
about
how
light
can
bend


when
light
goes
past
a
big
thing
like
a
star
the
light
changes
direction
because
the
star
has
a
lot
of
gravity


after
talking
about
light
stephen
hawking
talks
about
time
in
einstein
theory
of
relativity


one
broken
link
prediction
prediction
that
einstein
theory
makes
is
that
time
will
go
by
slower
when
something
is
near
big
things
like
the
earth


however
when
something
is
farther
away
from
the
big
thing
time
will
go
by
faster


stephen
hawking
used
the
idea
of
two
twins
two
people
who
are
the
living
at
different
places
to
describe
his
idea


if
one
of
the
twins
went
to
live
on
a
high
place
such
as
a
mountain
and
another
twin
went
to
live
at
a
lower
place
such
as
near
the
sea
the
twin
who
went
to
live
on
the
mountain
would
be
a
<collocation>little bit</collocation>
older
than
the
twin
who
went
to
live
at
the
sea


chapter
the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
is
shown
here


from
the
picture
we
can
tell
the
universe
is
getting
bigger
over
time


in
this
chapter
stephen
hawking
talks
about
the
expanding
universe


this
means
he
believes
the
universe
is
getting
bigger
over
time


one
of
the
things
he
uses
to
explain
his
idea
is
the
doppler
shift


the
doppler
shift
happens
when
something
moves
toward
or
away
from
another
object


there
are
two
types
of
things
that
happen
in
doppler
shift
red
shifting
and
blue
shifting


red
shifting
happens
when
something
is
moving
away
from
us


this
is
down
to
the
wavelength
of
the
visible
light
reaching
us
increasing
and
the
frequency
decreasing
which
shifts
the
visible
light
towards
the
end
of
the
<collocation>electromagnetic spectrum</collocation>


is
linked
to
the
belief
that
the
universe
is
expanding
as
the
wavelength
of
the
light
is
increasing
almost
as
if
stretched
as
planets
and
galaxies
move
away
from
us
which
<collocation>shares similarities</collocation>
to
that
of
the
<collocation>doppler effect</collocation>
involving
sound
waves


blue
shifting
happens
when
something
is
moving
toward
us
the
opposite
process
of
in
which
the
<collocation>wavelength decreases</collocation>
and
frequency
increases
shifting
the
light
towards
the
blue
end
of
the
spectrum


a
scientist
named
hubble
found
that
many
stars
are
red
shifted
and
are
moving
away
from
us


stephen
hawking
uses
the
doppler
shift
to
explain
that
the
universe
is
getting
bigger


the
beginning
of
the
universe
is
thought
to
have
happened
through
something
called
the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>


the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
was
a
very
big
explosion
that
created
the
universe


chapter
this
chapter
is
about
the
uncertainty
principle


the
uncertainty
principle
says
that
the
speed
and
the
position
or
where
something
is
of
a
particle
can
not
be
found
at
the
same
time


to
find
where
a
particle
is
scientists
shine
light
at
the
particle


if
a
high
frequency
light
is
used
the
light
can
find
the
position
more
accurately
but
the
particle
speed
will
be
unknown
because
the
light
will
change
the
speed
of
the
particle


if
a
lower
frequency
light
is
used
the
light
can
find
the
speed
more
accurately
but
the
particle
position
will
be
unknown


the
uncertainty
principle
disproved
the
idea
of
a
theory
that
was
deterministic
or
something
that
would
predict
everything
in
the
future


here
is
a
picture
of
a
light
wave


how
light
behaves
is
also
talked
more
about
in
this
chapter


some
theories
say
that
light
acts
like
particles
even
though
it
really
is
made
of
waves
one
theory
that
says
this
is
quantum
hypothesis


a
different
theory
also
says
that
light
waves
also
act
like
particles
a
theory
that
says
this
is
uncertainty
principle


light
interference
causes
many
colors
to
appear


light
waves
have
crests
and
troughs


the
<collocation>highest point</collocation>
of
a
wave
is
the
crest
and
the
lowest
part
of
the
wave
is
a
trough


sometimes
more
than
one
of
these
waves
can
broken
link
interfere
interfere
with
each
other
the
crests
and
the
troughs
line
up


this
is
called
light
interference


when
light
waves
interfere
with
each
other
this
can
make
many
colors


an
example
of
this
is
the
colors
in
<collocation>soap bubbles</collocation>


chapter
quarks
and
other
elementary
particles
very
small
things
are
the
topic
of
this
chapter


quarks
are
very
small
things
that
make
up
everything
we
see
matter


there
are
six
different
flavors
of
quarks
the
up
quark
down
quark
strange
quark
charmed
quark
bottom
quark
and
top
quark


quarks
also
have
three
colors
red
green
and
blue


there
are
also
which
are
the
opposite
of
the
regular
quarks


in
total
there
are
different
types
of
regular
quarks
and
different
types
of


quarks
are
known
as
the
building
blocks
of
matter
because
they
are
the
smallest
thing
that
make
up
all
the
matter
in
the
universe


a
particle
of
spin
needs
to
be
turned
around
all
the
way
to
look
the
same
again
like
this
arrow


all
particles
for
example
the
quarks
have
something
called
spin


the
spin
of
a
particle
shows
us
what
a
particle
looks
like
from
different
directions


for
example
a
particle
of
spin
looks
the
same
from
every
direction


a
particle
of
spin
looks
different
in
every
direction
unless
the
particle
is
spun
completely
around
spun
degrees


stephen
hawking
example
of
a
particle
of
spin
is
an
arrow


a
particle
of
spin
two
needs
to
be
turned
around
halfway
or
degrees
to
look
the
same


the
example
given
in
the
book
is
of
a
arrow


there
are
two
groups
of
particles
in
the
universe
particles
with
a
spin
of
and
particles
with
a
spin
of
or


all
of
these
particles
follow
<collocation>exclusion principle</collocation>


<collocation>exclusion principle</collocation>
says
that
particles
can
not
be
in
the
same
place
or
have
the
same
speed


if
<collocation>exclusion principle</collocation>
did
not
exist
then
everything
in
the
universe
would
look
the
same
like
a
roughly
uniform
and
dense
soup


this
is
a
proton


it
is
made
up
of
three
quarks


all
the
quarks
are
different
colors
because
of
confinement


particles
with
a
spin
of
or
move
force
from
one
particle
to
another


some
examples
of
these
particles
are
virtual
and
virtual
photons


virtual
have
a
spin
of
and
they
represent
the
force
of
gravity


this
means
that
when
gravity
affects
two
things
move
to
and
from
the
two
things


virtual
photons
have
a
spin
of
and
represent
electromagnetic
forces
or
the
force
that
holds
atoms
together


besides
the
force
of
gravity
and
the
electromagnetic
forces
there
are
weak
and
strong
nuclear
forces


weak
nuclear
forces
are
the
forces
that
cause
radioactivity
or
when
matter
emits
energy


weak
nuclear
force
works
on
particles
with
a
spin
of


strong
nuclear
forces
are
the
forces
that
keep
the
quarks
in
a
neutron
and
a
proton
together
and
keeps
the
protons
and
neutrons
together
in
an
atom


the
particle
that
carries
the
strong
nuclear
force
is
thought
to
be
a
gluon


the
gluon
is
a
particle
with
a
spin
of


the
gluon
holds
together
quarks
to
form
protons
and
neutrons


however
the
gluon
only
holds
together
quarks
that
are
three
different
colors


this
makes
the
end
product
have
no
color


this
is
called
confinement


some
scientists
have
tried
to
make
a
theory
that
combines
the
electromagnetic
force
the
weak
nuclear
force
and
the
strong
nuclear
force


this
theory
is
called
a
grand
unified
theory
or
a
gut


this
theory
tries
to
explain
these
forces
in
one
big
unified
way
or
theory


chapter
a
picture
of
a
black
hole
and
how
it
changes
light
around
it


black
holes
are
talked
about
in
this
chapter


black
holes
are
stars
that
have
collapsed
into
one
very
small
point


this
small
point
is
called
a
singularity


black
<collocation>holes suck</collocation>
things
into
its
center
because
its
gravity
is
very
strong


some
of
the
things
it
can
suck
in
are
light
and
stars


only
very
large
stars
called
are
big
enough
to
become
a
black
hole


the
star
must
be
one
and
a
half
times
the
mass
of
the
sun
or
larger
to
turn
into
a
black
hole


this
number
is
called
the
limit


if
the
mass
of
a
star
is
less
than
the
limit
it
will
not
turn
into
a
black
hole
instead
it
will
turn
into
a
different
smaller
type
of
star


the
boundary
of
the
black
hole
is
called
the
<collocation>event horizon</collocation>


if
something
is
in
the
<collocation>event horizon</collocation>
it
will
never
get
out
of
the
black
hole


black
holes
can
be
shaped
differently


some
black
holes
are
perfectly
spherical
like
a
ball


other
black
holes
bulge
in
the
middle


black
holes
will
be
spherical
if
they
do
not
rotate


black
holes
will
bulge
in
the
middle
if
they
rotate


black
holes
are
difficult
to
find
because
they
do
not
let
out
any
light


they
can
be
found
when
black
<collocation>holes suck</collocation>
in
other
stars


when
black
<collocation>holes suck</collocation>
in
other
stars
the
black
hole
lets
out
which
can
be
seen
by
telescopes
an
object
that
can
see
things
very
far
away


in
this
chapter
stephen
hawking
talks
about
his
bet
with
another
scientist
kip


stephen
hawking
bet
that
black
holes
did
not
exist
because
he
did
not
want
his
work
on
black
holes
to
be
wasted


he
lost
the
bet


chapter
this
chapter
explains
more
about
black
holes


stephen
hawking
realized
that
the
<collocation>event horizon</collocation>
of
a
black
hole
could
only
get
bigger
not
smaller


the
area
of
the
<collocation>event horizon</collocation>
of
a
black
hole
gets
bigger
whenever
something
falls
into
the
black
hole


he
also
realized
that
when
two
black
holes
combine
the
size
of
the
new
<collocation>event horizon</collocation>
is
greater
than
or
equal
to
the
sum
of
the
event
horizons
of
the
two
other
black
holes


this
means
that
a
black
hole
<collocation>event horizon</collocation>
can
never
get
smaller


disorder
also
known
as
entropy
is
related
to
black
holes


there
is
a
scientific
law
that
has
to
do
with
entropy


this
law
is
called
the
second
law
of
thermodynamics
and
it
says
that
entropy
or
disorder
will
always
increase
in
an
isolated
system
for
example
the
universe


the
relation
between
the
amount
of
entropy
in
a
black
hole
and
the
size
of
the
black
hole
<collocation>event horizon</collocation>
was
first
thought
of
by
a
research
student
jacob
and
proven
by
stephen
hawking


stephen
hawking
calculations
said
that
black
holes
emit
radiation


this
was
strange
because
it
was
already
said
that
nothing
can
escape
from
a
black
hole
<collocation>event horizon</collocation>


this
problem
was
solved
when
the
idea
of
pairs
of
virtual
particles
was
thought
of


one
of
the
pair
of
particles
would
fall
into
the
black
hole
and
the
other
would
escape


this
would
look
like
the
black
hole
was
emitting
particles


this
idea
seemed
strange
at
first
but
many
people
accepted
it
after
a
while


chapter
how
the
universe
started
and
how
it
might
end
is
talked
about
in
this
chapter


most
scientists
believe
that
the
universe
started
in
an
explosion
called
the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>


the
model
for
this
is
called
the
hot
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
model


when
the
universe
starts
getting
bigger
the
things
inside
of
it
also
begin
to
get
cooler


when
the
universe
was
first
beginning
it
was
infinitely
hot


the
temperature
of
the
universe
cooled
and
the
things
inside
the
universe
began
to
clump
together


stephen
hawking
also
talks
about
how
the
universe
could
have
been


for
example
if
the
universe
formed
and
then
collapsed
quickly
there
would
not
be
enough
time
for
life
to
form


another
example
would
be
a
universe
that
expanded
too
quickly


if
a
universe
expanded
too
quickly
it
would
become
almost
empty


the
idea
of
many
universes
is
called
the
interpretation


<collocation>inflationary models</collocation>
are
also
discussed
in
this
chapter
and
so
is
the
idea
of
a
theory
that
unifies
<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
and
gravity


each
particle
has
many
histories


this
idea
is
known
as
theory
of
sum
over
histories


a
theory
that
unifies
<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
and
gravity
should
have
theory
in
it


to
find
the
chance
that
a
particle
will
pass
through
a
point
the
waves
of
each
particle
needs
to
be
added
up


these
waves
happen
in
imaginary
time


<collocation>imaginary numbers</collocation>
when
multiplied
by
themselves
make
a
negative
number
