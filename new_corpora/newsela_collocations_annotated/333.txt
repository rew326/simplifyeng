the
white
and
black
colors
are
for
camouflage
to
help
them
hide
when
they
swim


so
when
a
predator
looking
from
underwater
sees
the
white
belly
and
wings
of
the
penguin
they
can
not
see
it
well
with
the
light
coming
from
above


seen
from
above
the
penguin
black
back
blends
in
with
the
dark
water


the
biggest
penguins
may
stand
nearly
feet
tall
cm
and
can
weigh
almost
pounds
kg


the
smallest
kinds
are
only
about
one
foot
cm
tall


penguins
have
a
thick
layer
of
blubber
that
helps
them
keep
warm
and
their
feathers
are
very
tightly
packed
to
make
another
cover


they
also
have
a
layer
of
woolly
down
under
the
feathers
that
are
coated
with
a
type
of
oil
that
makes
them
waterproof


life
penguins
eat
krill
fish
squid
and
other
small
animals
from
the
ocean
which
they
catch


they
are
at
home
in
the
ocean


they
come
up
on
the
land
or
ice
to
lay
their
eggs
and
raise
the
chicks


the
animals
all
nest
together
in
a
huge
group
called
a
broken
link
rookery
rookery


they
usually
make
nests
on
the
ground
with
rocks
or
mud


after
the
penguins
mate
the
mother
lays
her
egg
on
the
ice
before
winter


she
lets
the
father
take
care
of
it
by
putting
it
on
his
foot
and
covering
it
up
with
his
warm
belly


the
mother
then
goes
for
two
months
to
live
in
the
ocean
eating
and
eating
and
getting
fat


the
fathers
all
huddle
together
in
a
group
to
help
protect
each
others
eggs


they
do
not
eat
anything
but
live
off
of
the
fat
on
their
bodies


when
the
baby
penguin
comes
out
of
the
egg
the
father
gives
it
a
liquid
that
he
makes
inside
his
throat


soon
the
mother
joins
them
and
gives
the
baby
some
food


the
hungry
father
will
go
out
to
the
ocean
and
find
some
food


he
will
return
after
weeks
and
then
the
two
of
the
parents
will
take
turns
going
out
finding
food
and
coming
back
to
take
care
of
their
chick


different
kinds
there
are
living
species
types
of
penguins


the
penguin
is
today
generally
considered
a
subspecies
of
the
little
penguin


it
is
still
unclear
if
the
royal
penguin
is
a
subspecies
of
the
macaroni
penguin


it
is
also
possible
that
northern
and
southern
penguins
are
separate
species


it
is
a
common
misconception
that
some
species
of
penguins
withhold
pouches
however
this
is
not
true

this

was
made
by
christian

it
was
the

day
as
a
pagan
holiday
called


the
missionaries
came
to
areas
where
pagans
lived


they
tried
to
make
the
pagans
believe
in
christianity


so
they
made

significance
halloween
is
a
holiday
in
many
english
speaking
countries
that
is
celebrated
on
the
night
of
october


children
wear
costumes
and
they
go
to
peoples
homes
saying
trick
or
treat


to
ask
for
candy
sweets
in
the
<collocation>united kingdom</collocation>
or
lollies
in
australia
and
then
people
give
it
to
them


this
practice
originally
involved
a
threat


a
threat
is
when
someone
says
that
they
will
do
something
bad
if
they
do
not
get
what
they
want


in
this
case
the
threat
could
be
explained
as
give
me
a
treat
or
i
will
play
a
trick
on
you


children
today
usually
do
not
play
tricks
if
they
do
not
get
treats


however
some
children
still
get
up
to
mischief
pranks
or
things
to
make
fun
of
people
like
putting
toilet
paper
in
trees
writing
on
windows
with
soap
or
throwing
eggs
at
peoples
houses


people
sometimes
dress
up
as
ghosts
witches
goblins
and
other
scary
things
for
halloween


origins
the
pagan
holiday
that
the
all
saints
holy
day
replaced
was
also
known
as
the
day
of
the
dead


many
and
modern
pagans
celebrate
the
day
of
the
dead


fact
date
october
this
is
a
happy
holiday
even
though
it
celebrates
death


it
is
the
day
that
the
souls
of
dead
people
are
believed
to
come
back
to
earth


many
lutheran
churches
celebrate
a
holiday
on
october
called
the
reformation


this
holiday
celebrates
the
day
that
martin
luther
put
the
theses
on
a
church
door


halloween
halloween
it
is
said
that
on
the
night
of
all
hallow
eve
the
gap
between
the
living
and
dead
worlds
are
closer
and
that
<collocation>dead souls</collocation>
come
back
to
earth


the
souls
would
then
look
for
a
living
body
to
possess
for
the
next
year


people
not
wanting
to
be
possessed
would
leave
food
and
drinks
outside
their
doors
to
please
the
souls


over
time
beggars
started
taking
and
then
begging
for
food
and
then
children
started
to


this
is
only
believed
in
some
religions


dressing
up
as
well
as
leaving
food
out
some
people
would
dress
up
as
ghosts
and
scary
things
so
the
<collocation>dead souls</collocation>
would
think
that
they
were
dead
too
or
to
scare
them
away


eventually
these
two
traditions
combined
creating


and
diego
carmen

usually
known
as
was
a
mexican
painter


she
was
known

her

to

a

she
was
born
