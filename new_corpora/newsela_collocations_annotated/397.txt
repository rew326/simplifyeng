european

per

is
a
country
in
the
north
sea
but
it
is
not
an
island


a
structure
called
roughs
tower
was
built
in
the
sea
by
the
british
royal
navy
and
later
became


it
is
very
small


there
is
only
room
for
people
on
it


even
though
a
man
named
michael
bates
says
is
a
country
not
all
countries
agree
with
him


once
some
people
from
the
netherlands
went
to
to
take
it
over


michael
bates
did
not
want
this
to
happen
so
he
used
helicopters
and
fought
them
to
get
it
back


he
won
and
put
some
of
those
people
in
jail
until
he
was
pressured
to
let
them
go
by
other
countries


if
a
boat
goes
too
near
people
from
might
fire
guns
at
the
boat


even
though
michael
bates
says
he
is
the
prince
of
it
is
very
small
so
he
usually
is
not
there


other
people
stay
there
to
take
care
of


has
its
own
stamps
national
anthem
money
flag
and
more
things
just
like
a
real
country


bates
reasons
why
should
be
a
real
country
are
these
is
out
in
the
ocean
and
when
was
created
no
country
owned
the
ocean


also
people
asked
michael
bates
to
let
his
prisoners
from
the
netherlands
go


bates
said
that
if
they
thought
was
not
a
country
they
would
not
ask
him
to
do
that

above
in

the
two
most
common
rules
of
statehood
are
the
and
<collocation>declaratory theories</collocation>
of
state
creation


in
the
theory
a
state
exists
by
recognition
by
other
states


the
theory
splits
on
whether
this
recognition
requires
<collocation>diplomatic recognition</collocation>
or
just
recognition
of
existence


no
other
state
grants
official
recognition
but
it
has
been
argued
by
bates
that
negotiations
carried
out
by
germany
constituted
recognition
of
existence


in
the
declaratory
theory
of
statehood
an
entity
becomes
a
state
as
soon
as
it
meets
the
minimal
criteria
for
statehood


therefore
recognition
by
other
states
is
purely
declaratory

he
used

too

used
for
anything
