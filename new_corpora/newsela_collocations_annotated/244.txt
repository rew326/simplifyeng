story
the
main
character
of
the
movie
is
thomas
anderson
played
by
reeves
who
is
a
computer
programmer
at
a
big
software
company
but
he
is
also
an
underground
hacker


thomas
meets
trinity
played
by
moss
who
then
introduces
him
to
morpheus
played
by
laurence
who
gives
him
a
choice
between
taking
a
blue
pill
or
a
red
pill


if
he
took
the
blue
pill
he
would
wake
up
at
his
bed
and
would
be
bothered
anymore
but
if
he
took
the
red
pill
morpheus
would
show
him
the
truth
about
the
matrix


thomas
takes
the
red
pill


then
morpheus
tells
thomas
he
is
actually
neo
or
the
one


he
explains
neo
that
the
matrix
is
a
computer
program
made
by
robots
to
simulate
a
world
which
humans
think
its
real


he
then
explains
neo
that
because
he
is
the
one
he
is
able
to
modify
the
matrix
however
he
wants


morpheus
then
helps
neo
to
get
out
of
the
matrix


at
the
beginning
neo
is
skeptical
about
his
power
but
after
training
he
is
able
to
show
his
real
power


neo
trinity
morpheus
and
the
rest
of
the
rebels
then
go
on
a
journey
to
free
humans
from
the
matrix
symbolism
there
is
a
lot
of
symbolism
in
the
matrix


common
sources
are
christianity
buddhism
hinduism
the
concept
of
maya
the
ancient
philosopher
plato
and
plato
cave
modern
philosophers
such
as
descartes
and
modern
authors
such
as
william
gibson


descartes
says
that
maybe
humans
are
brains
in
jars


a
monster
is
maybe
tricking
humans


the
monster
makes
humans
believe
that
they
are
in
the
real
world
but
actually
humans
are
simply
brains


humans
can
not
know
what
is
real


philosophy
there
are
also
references
to
simulacra
and
simulation
a
very
modern
philosophy
book
by
jean


says
that
in
the
modern
world
copies
of
copies
are
made


the
real
is
gone
because
people
do
not
know
what
the
first
things
were


for
example
a
modern
person
who
eats
a
chicken
did
not
kill
the
chicken


that
person
does
not
know
what
a
real
chicken
is


the
chicken
meat
is
false
because
the
person
did
not
kill
the
chicken


the
person
reality
is
the
chicken
meat


trivia

the
letters
in
neo

neo
becomes
one


morpheus
is
the
greek
god

nebuchadnezzar
morpheus
ship
gets
its
name
from
the
king
from
babylon
who
had
many
dreams
and
was
a
king
of
change
and
of

people

including

this
was
the
first
big

by
non

on

in
when
japanese
war
planes
attacked
the
us
naval
base
at

harbor
hawaii
was
not
yet
part
of

there
had

some
big
terrorist
acts
against
american
targets
before
but
most
of
them
have
been
outside
the
such
as
the
marine
camp
in
lebanon


many
conspiracy
theories
have
appeared
which
say
that
certain
people
in
the
united

government
knew
about
the
attacks
beforehand
or
even
made

happen


the
world
<collocation>trade center</collocation>
before


war
on
terror
main
war
on
terrorism
after
the
attack
the
united
states
blamed
which
the
thought
was
a
terrorist
group


president
george
bush
said
he
would
start
a
war
on
terror


he
meant
that
the
united
states
would
do
more
things
to
try
to
stop
terrorism
in
the
future


bush
said
this
was
meant
to
protect
americans
and
their
property
from
terrorists


for
example
the
american
government
would
be
reorganized


security
in
public
places
was
made
stronger
especially
at
airports


americans
were
told
every
day
whether
there
was
a
serious
threat
of
terrorism


this
was
done
by
giving
a
color
for
the
day


red
meant
there
was
a
high
risk
green
meant
a
low
risk
and
there
were
many
levels
in
between


the
war
on
terror
also
led
to
real
wars


the
leader
of
bin
laden
lived
in
the
islamic
of
afghanistan


the
united
states
told
the
government
of
afghanistan
called
the
to
turn
bin
laden
over
to
them


the
would
not
do
this


the
leader
of
the
<collocation>mullah muhammad</collocation>
demanded
to
see
proof
from
the
united
states
government


if
proof
was
not
given
mullah
said
that
he
would
not
hand
over
bin
laden


president
george
bush
said
that
he
did
not
need
to
provide
proof


the
united
states
then
went
to
war
against
afghanistan


the
was
removed
from
power
a
new
government
was
put
in
power
and
a
new
president
was
chosen
by
the
people
of
afghanistan


while
this
was
happening
the
united
states
government
changed
in
a
few
ways


the
department
of
transportation
dot
created
the
transportation
security
administration


before
security
at
american
airports
was
provided
by
the
airlines


the
made
it
the
government
job
to
provide
airport
security


new
officers
were
hired
by
to
work
at
airports
and
to
fly
on
planes
as
<collocation>air marshals</collocation>


the
also
provides
security
on
american
trains
and
subways


a
new
department
of
homeland
security
was
also
created


it
became
their
job
to
protect
americans
and
their
property
inside
the
united
states


when
this
department
was
created
the
moved
from
the
dot
to
homeland
security


after
defeating
the
president
george
bush
thought
the
us
should
invade
iraq


he
believed
that
iraq
helped
terrorist
groups
including


he
said
he
had
evidence
that
iraq
was
also
making
weapons
of
mass
destruction


he
sent
secretary
of
state
colin
to
the
united
nations
to
show
them
some
of
the
evidence


in
march
the
united
states
began
its
invasion
of
iraq


four
other
countries
also
took
part
including
the
<collocation>united kingdom</collocation>
australia
poland
and
denmark


the
government
of
iraq
was
overthrown
and
the
people
of
iraq
elected
a
new
government


no
weapons
of
mass
destruction
were
found
in
iraq
