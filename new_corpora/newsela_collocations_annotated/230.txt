it
was
a
time
when
there
were
a
lot
of
changes
in
society


after
the
wars
that
napoleon
had
waged
there
were
not
so
many
<collocation>ruling aristocratic</collocation>
families


there
was
a
lot
of
feeling
of
nationalism
as
countries
united


century
music
is
often
nationalistic
composers
wrote
music
that
was
typical
of
their
own
country


some
of
the
greatest
composers
include
ludwig
van
beethoven
<collocation>franz schubert</collocation>
hector
chopin
robert
felix
mendelssohn
johannes
brahms
tchaikovsky
edward
and

century
what
is
known
as
century
classical
music
or
modern
music
is
music
from
about
onwards


at
this
time
many
composers
felt
that
everything
had
already
been
done
by
the
composers
of
the
past
so
they
wanted
to
find
new
ways
of
composing


debussy
arnold
and
stravinsky
in
particular
found
new
ways
of
writing
music
which
was
not
necessarily
tonal
in
any
particular
key


classical
music
was
influenced
by
jazz
especially
with
american
composers


later
in
the
century
people
such
as
pierre
and
experimented
in
many
other
ways
including
with
electronic
music
tape
recorders


today
composers
have
combined
some
of
these
ideas
to
develop
their
own
styles


some
of
the
most
important
composers
are
debussy
jean
ravel
arnold
stravinsky
aaron
benjamin
britten
leonard
philip
glass

conclusion
it
has
never
been
possible
to
say
exactly
what
is
meant
by
classical
music


many
different
kinds
of
music
influence
one
another


since
it
has
been
even
harder
to
make
clear
dividing
lines
between
rock
pop
classical
folk
jazz
and
world
music


this
shows
that
classical
music
like
other
kinds
of
music
continues
to
develop
and
reflect
the
society
from
which
it
comes

this

has
influenced

he
describes
the
way
that
a
prince
by
which
means
a
ruler
can
control
the
people
he
rules


he
looks
especially
at
what
he
calls
the
new
prince
saying
that
a
prince
from
a
royal
family
has
an
easier
job
because
the
people
are
used
to
his
family
and
the
way

all
that
such
a

needs
to

carefully
stick
to
the

working
that
the
people
are
used
to


a
new
prince
has
a
much
more
difficult
job
because
he
must
get
people
used

his

power
and
build
up
new
ways
of
working
that
people
can
get
used
to


this
job
means
that
in
the
new
prince
has
to
act
in
a
way
people
would
not
quickly
criticize
but
says
this
may
mean
doing
bad
but
necessary
things
which
people
do
not
see
or
remember


otherwise
a
new
prince
will
find
it
difficult
to
get
anything
important
done
or
even
to
keep
ruling
