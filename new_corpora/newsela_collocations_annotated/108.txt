this
was
the
golden
age
of
russian
literature


russian
literature
became
famous
throughout
the
world


all
of
russia
began
to
use
russian
as
its
language
of
literature
education
and
official
communication


until
the
century
only
the
upper
classes
and
people
in
cities
spoke
the
literary
language


russians
from
the
countryside
continued
to
speak
their
local
dialects


starting
in
the
century
all
children
were
required
to
go
to
school


many
people
had
radios
and
televisions


this
helped
spread
standard
russian


in
the
century
the
dialects
of
russian
mostly
disappeared


they
were
gone
by
the
middle
of
the
century


standard
russian
replaced
them
almost
completely


naming
in
russian
a
person
name
has
three
parts


these
are
the
first
name
the
second
name
and
the
family
name


parents
choose
the
first
name
for
their
child


some
common
russian
names
for
boys
are
and


some
common
russian
names
for
girls
are
anna
and


the
second
name
is
called
the
patronymic


it
comes
from
the
first
name
of
one
father


the
russian
word
for
this
is


take
for
example
a
boy
whose
father
is
named


the
boy
patronymic
is


another
example
a
boy
father
is
named


the
boy
patronymic
is


if
a
girl
father
is
named
her
patronymic
is


if
her
father
is
named
her
patronymic
is


the
patronymic
of
a
boy
ends
with
or


the
patronymic
of
a
girl
ends
with
or


boys
have
the
same
family
name
as
their
fathers


girls
also
use
their
father
family
name
but
with
one
difference


an
a
is
put
on
the
end
of
the
name


take
for
example
a
man
with
the
family
name


his
son
family
name
is


his
daughter
family
name
is


another
example
a
man
name
is


he
has
a
son
named
and
a
daughter
named


the
son
full
name
is


the
daughter
full
name
is


there
are
also
many
people
in
russia
with
family
names
that
are
not
russian


some
of
these
names
have
only
one
form


that
means
the
family
name
is
the
same
for
sons
and
daughters


some
examples
are
a
ukrainian
name
a
german
hebrew
name
or
a
georgian
name


<collocation>grammar case</collocation>
like
latin
greek
and
german
russian
has
a
case
system


in
russian
the
case
system
applies
to
nouns
pronouns
adjectives
numerals
and
participles


the
case
system
is
a
set
of
word
endings
attached
to
the
ends
of
words
that
show
the
<collocation>grammatical roles</collocation>
of
words
in
a
sentence


because
the
<collocation>grammatical roles</collocation>
are
shown
by
the
endings
the
order
of
words
in
a
sentence
is
more
free
in
russian
than
for
example
in
english


there
are
six
cases
in
russian


the
<collocation>nominative case</collocation>
which
is
the
form
listed
in
the
dictionary
is
used
for
the
subject
of
the
sentence


the
case
often
shows
ownership


the
case
is
used
for
a
direct
object
the
case
for
an
indirect
object


the
instrumental
case
is
used
for
the
tool
or
instrument
with
which
something
is
done


the
<collocation>prepositional case</collocation>
is
used
after
certain
prepositions
such
as
in
and
on
but
other
prepositions
may
require
the
use
of
other
cases


each
of
the
cases
has
other
uses
besides
the
basic
ones
just
listed


gender
and
number
in
russian
nouns
have
one
of
three
genders
masculine
feminine
or
neuter


<collocation>masculine nouns</collocation>
usually
end
in
consonants
neuter
nouns
usually
end
in
o
or
e
and
<collocation>feminine nouns</collocation>
usually
end
in
a
or


there
is
also
the
plural
which
acts
much
like
a
fourth
gender
when
a
word
is
made
into
the
plural
its
gender
does
not
matter
as
far
as
the
case
system
is
concerned


adjectives
in
russian
an
adjective
a
describing
word
must
agree
with
the
word
it
describes
in
gender
and
number


in
the
<collocation>nominative case</collocation>
adjectives
that
describe
feminine
words
usually
end
in
or


ones
that
describe
masculine
words
usually
end
in
or


ones
that
describe
neuter
words
usually
end
in
or


ones
that
describe
plural
words
usually
end
in
or


these
endings
change
depending
on
the
case

that
the
british
owned
it


but
starting
in
the
late
spanish
religious
leaders
of
the
roman
catholic
church
missionaries
got
large
gifts
of
land
in
the
area
north
of
baja
california
from
the
spanish
king
and
queen


these
religious
people
set
up
small
towns
and
villages
the
famous
<collocation>california missions</collocation>


when
mexico
was
no
longer
controlled
by
spain
the
mexican
government
took
over
the
villages
and
they
soon
became
empty


san
francisco
california
in
as
the
war
was
starting
some
americans
in
california
hoped
to
create
a
california
republic


these
men
flew
a
bear
flag
that
had
a
golden
bear
with
a
star
on
it


this
republic
ended
suddenly
however
when
commodore
john
of
the
united
states
navy
sailed
into
san
francisco
bay


he
said
that
california
was
now
part
of
the
united
states


after
the
war
with
mexico
ended
california
was
split
between
the
two
countries


the
mexican
portion
became
the
mexican
states
of
baja
california
north
and
baja
california
sur
south


baja
means
lower
in
spanish


the
western
part
of
the
part
given
to
the
united
states
became
today
state
of
california


in
there
were
about
people
in
today
california
on
the
american
side


today
the
state
has
a
total
of
nearly
people


in
gold
was
suddenly
found
and
the
number
of
people
went
up
very
fast
as
the
<collocation>gold rush</collocation>
took
hold


in
california
became
a
state
in
the
union
the
united
states


during
the
american
civil
war
many
people
in
california
especially
in
the
southern
part
of
california
thought
the
south
was
right


some
people
in
southern
california
even
wanted
southern
california
to
leave
the
rest
of
the
state
and
join
the
confederate
states
of
america


however
this
did
not
happen


california
joined
the
war
to
and
helped
the
the
north
the
union
and
sent
many
troops
east
to
fight
the
confederacy


at
first
travel
between
the
far
west
and
the
east
coast
of
the
united
states
was
dangerous
and
took
a
lot
of
time


going
by
land
was
very
difficult
because
there
were
no
roads
and
no
trains
and
many
<collocation>native americans</collocation>
were
attacking
american
people
heading
west
in
wagons


the
only
other
way
was
to
travel
by
boat
around
the
<collocation>cape horn</collocation>
at
the
southern
end
of
south
america


this
took
months
since
the
trip
was
thousands
of
miles
long
and
the
<collocation>panama canal</collocation>
had
not
yet
been
built
either


but
in
the
connection
got
better
quickly
because
the
first
railroad
across
the
continent
was
finished


meanwhile
more
people
in
california
were
learning
that
the
land
there
was
very
good
to
grow
fruit
and
other
crops


oranges
were
grown
in
many
parts
of
california


this
was
the
beginning
of
the
huge
farming
business
that
california
has
today


present
day
in
there
were
only
a
million
people
in
california
and
in
angeles


today
california
has
more
people
than
any
other
state


starting
in
the
variety
of
people
became
much
greater
as
many
different
people
from
around
the
world
came
to
the
united
states
and
often
decided
to
live
in
california


california
is
thought
to
be
a
very
liberal
state
but
there
are
still
a
lot
of
people
who
are
republicans


technology
is
very
advanced
and
many
new
cultural
trends
begin
there


engineering
and
computers
play
a
big
part
in
the
state
life


for
over
a
<collocation>hundred years</collocation>
film
has
been
one
of
the
most
important
businesses
in
california


by
the
television
had
also
become
an
important
business
in
california

propaganda
the
from


propaganda
is
a
form
of
communication
to
distribute
information


it
is
always
biased


the
information
is
designed
to
make
people
feel
a
certain
way
or
to
believe
a
certain
thing


the
information
is
often
political


it
is
hard
to
tell
whether
the
information
is
true
or
false


very
often
the
information
is
confusing
and
unfair


propaganda
does
tend
to
make
disputes
last
longer
and
be
more
difficult
to
resolve


the
word
propaganda
comes
from
latin


at
first
it
meant
ideas
to
be
spread
around


but
in
the
first
<collocation>world war</collocation>
it
came
to
mean
political
ideas
that
are
supposed
to
be
misleading


propaganda
is
like
advertising
in
some
ways


for
example
it
uses
the
mass
media
to
spread
its
ideas


but
advertising
is
usually
trying
to
sell
something
whereas
propaganda
is
about
ideas


it
is
often
political
and
used
by
states
or
political
parties
not
private
companies


propaganda
is
often
used
during
wars


there
it
can
be
very
useful
