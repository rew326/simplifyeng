term
universe

everything
that

or
the
beginning
of

as
in

aristotle

roughly
<collocation>analogous elements</collocation>

the

the

matter
in

and

how
matter
is
created
destroyed
or
altered
in
its
properties
and
similarly
how
form
is
altered


physical
laws
were
the
rules
governing
the
properties
of
matter

and
their
changes


later
philosophers
such
as
and

or
refined

for
example
and

governing

it

to

each
existing
but
not
able

interact
with
each
other


an
easy
way
to
think
of
this
is
a
group
of
separate
<collocation>soap bubbles</collocation>
in
which
people
living
on
one
<collocation>soap bubble</collocation>
can
not
interact
with
those
on
other
<collocation>soap bubbles</collocation>


according
to
one
common
terminology
each
<collocation>soap bubble</collocation>
of
is
denoted
as
a
universe
whereas
our
particular
is
denoted
as
the
universe
just
as
we
call
our

the
entire
collection
of
these

in
principle
the

and
of

of

although

observable
reality
according
to
a
definition
the
universe
is
everything
within
our
connected
that
could
have
a
chance
to
interact
with
us
and
vice
versa


according
to
the
general
idea
of
relativity
some
regions
of
space
may
never
interact
with
ours
even
in
the
lifetime
of
the
universe
due
to
the
finite
speed
of
light
and
the
<collocation>ongoing expansion</collocation>
of
space


for
example
radio
messages
sent
from
earth
may
never
reach
some
regions
of
space
even
if
the
universe
would
exist
forever
space
may
expand
faster
than
light
can
traverse
it


it
is
worth
emphasizing
that
those
distant
regions
of
space
are
taken
to
exist
and
be
part
of
reality
as
much
as
we
are
yet
we
can
never
interact
with
them
even
in
principle


the
spatial
region
within
which
we
can
affect
and
be
affected
is
denoted
as
the
<collocation>observable universe</collocation>


strictly
speaking
the
<collocation>observable universe</collocation>
depends
on
the
location
of
the
observer


by
traveling
an
observer
can
come
into
contact
with
a
greater
region
of
than
an
observer
who
remains
still
so
that
the
<collocation>observable universe</collocation>
for
the
former
is
larger
than
for
the
latter


nevertheless
even
the
most
<collocation>rapid traveler</collocation>
may
not
be
able
to
interact
with
all
of
space


typically
the
<collocation>observable universe</collocation>
is
taken
to
mean
the
universe
observable
from
our
<collocation>vantage point</collocation>
in
the
milky
way
galaxy


basic
data
on
the
universe
the
universe
is
thought
to
be
mostly
made
of
dark
energy
and
dark
matter
both
of
which
are
not
understood
right
now


less
than
of
the
universe
is
ordinary
matter


the
elementary
particles
from
which
the
universe
is
constructed


six
leptons
and
six
quarks
comprise
most
of
the
matter
for
example
the
protons
and
neutrons
of
atomic
nuclei
are
composed
of
quarks
and
the
<collocation>ubiquitous electron</collocation>
is
a
lepton


these
particles
interact
via
the
gauge
shown
in
the
middle
row
each
corresponding
to
a
particular
type
of
<collocation>gauge symmetry</collocation>


the
as
yet
unobserved
is
believed
to
confer
mass
on
the
particles
with
which
it
is
connected


the
graviton
a
supposed
gauge
for
gravity
is
not
shown


the
universe
is
huge
and
possibly
infinite
in
volume


the
matter
which
can
be
seen
is
spread
over
a
space
at
least
billion
light
years
across


for
comparison
the
diameter
of
a
typical
galaxy
is
only
and
the
typical
distance
between
two
neighboring
galaxies
is
only
million


as
an
example
our
milky
way
galaxy
is
roughly
light
years
in
diameter
and
our
nearest
sister
galaxy
the
<collocation>andromeda galaxy</collocation>
is
located
roughly
million
light
years
away


there
are
probably
more
than
billion
galaxies
in
the
<collocation>observable universe</collocation>


<collocation>typical galaxies</collocation>
range
from
dwarf
with
as
few
as
ten
million
stars
up
to
giants
with
one
trillion
stars
all
orbiting
the
galaxy
center
of
mass


thus
a
very
<collocation>rough estimate</collocation>
from
these
numbers
would
suggest
there
are
around
one
stars
in
the
<collocation>observable universe</collocation>
though
a
study
by
australian
national
university
astronomers
resulted
in
a
figure
of
x


the
matter
that
can
be
seen
is
spread
throughout
the
universe
when
averaged
over
distances
longer
than
million


however
on
smaller
matter
is
observed
to
form
clumps
many
atoms
are
condensed
into
stars
most
stars
into
galaxies
most
galaxies
into
galaxy
groups
and
clusters
and
lastly
the
structures
such
as
the
great
wall
of
galaxies


the
present
overall
density
of
the
universe
is
very
low
roughly
grams
per
<collocation>cubic centimetre</collocation>


this
appears
to
consist
of
dark
energy
cold
dark
matter
and
ordinary
matter


the
density
of
atoms
is
about
a
single
hydrogen
atom
for
every
four
cubic
meters
of
volume


the
properties
of
dark
energy
and
dark
matter
are
not
known


dark
matter
slows
the
expansion
of
the
universe


dark
energy
makes
its
expansion
faster


the
universe
is
old
and
changing


the
best
good
guess
of
the
universe
age
is
billion
years
old
based
on
what
was
seen
of
the
cosmic
<collocation>microwave background</collocation>
radiation


independent
estimates
based
on
measurements
such
as
radioactive
dating
agree
although
they
are
less
precise
ranging
from
billion
years
to
billion
years


the
universe
has
not
been
the
same
at
all
times
in
its
history


this
getting
bigger
accounts
for
how
people
can
see
the
light
from
a
galaxy
billion
light
years
away
even
if
that
light
has
traveled
for
only
billion
years
the
very
space
between
them
has
expanded


this
expansion
is
consistent
with
the
observation
that
the
light
from
<collocation>distant galaxies</collocation>
has
been
the
photons
emitted
have
been
stretched
to
longer
wavelengths
and
lower
frequency
during
their
journey


the
rate
of
this
spatial
expansion
is
accelerating
based
on
studies
of
type
ia
supernovae
and
other
data


the
relative
amounts
of
different
chemical
elements
especially
the
lightest
atoms
such
as
hydrogen
deuterium
and
helium
seem
to
be
identical
in
all
of
the
universe
and
throughout
all
of
the
history
of
it
that
we
know
of


the
universe
seems
to
have
much
more
matter
than
antimatter


the
universe
appears
to
have
no
net
electric
charge


gravity
is
the
<collocation>dominant interaction</collocation>
at
cosmological
distances


the
universe
also
seems
to
have
no
net
momentum
or
angular
momentum


the
absence
of
net
charge
and
momentum
is
expected
if
the
universe
is
finite


the
universe
appears
to
have
a
smooth
continuum
made
of
three
<collocation>spatial dimensions</collocation>
and
one
temporal
time
dimension


on
the
average
space
is
very
nearly
flat
close
to
zero
curvature
meaning
that
euclidean
geometry
is
experimentally
true
with
high
accuracy
throughout
most
of
the
universe


however
the
universe
may
have
more
dimensions
and
its
spacetime
may
have
a
multiply
connected
global


the
universe
has
the
same
physical
laws
and
<collocation>physical constants</collocation>
throughout


according
to
the
prevailing
<collocation>standard model</collocation>
of
physics
all
matter
is
composed
of
three
generations
of
leptons
and
quarks
both
of
which
are


these
elementary
particles
interact
via
at
most
three
<collocation>fundamental interactions</collocation>

which
includes
electromagnetism
and
the
weak
nuclear
force
the
strong
nuclear
force
described
by
quantum
and
gravity
which
is
best
described
at
present
by
general

special
relativity
holds
in
all
the

in

and

otherwise
general

there
is
no
explanation
for

values
that

appear
to
have
throughout

such
as

<collocation>theoretical models</collocation>
general
theory
of

main
general
relativity
accurate
predictions
of
the
universe
past
and
future
require
an
accurate
theory
of
gravitation


the
best
theory
available
is
albert
einstein
general
theory
of
relativity
which
has
passed
all
experimental
tests
so
far


however
since
<collocation>rigorous experiments</collocation>
have
not
been
carried
out
on
cosmological
length
scales
general
relativity
could
conceivably
be
inaccurate


nevertheless
its
predictions
appear
to
be
consistent
with
observations
so
there
is
no
reason
to
adopt
another
theory


general
relativity
provides
of
a
set
of
ten
nonlinear
partial
<collocation>differential equations</collocation>
for
the
spacetime
metric
einstein
field
equations
that
must
be
solved
from
the
distribution
of
and
momentum
throughout
the
universe


since
these
are
unknown
in
exact
detail
cosmological
models
have
been
based
on
the
cosmological
principle
which
states
that
the
universe
is
homogeneous
and


in
effect
this
principle
asserts
that
the
gravitational
effects
of
the
various
galaxies
making
up
the
universe
are
equivalent
to
those
of
a
fine
dust
distributed
uniformly
throughout
the
universe
with
the
same
average
density


the
assumption
of
a
uniform
dust
makes
it
easy
to
solve
einstein
field
equations
and
predict
the
past
and
future
of
the
universe
on
cosmological
time
scales


einstein
field
equations
include
a
cosmological
constant
that
is
related
to
an
energy
density
of
empty
space


depending
on
its
sign
the
cosmological
constant
can
either
slow
negative
or
accelerate
positive
the
expansion
of
the
universe


although
many
scientists
including
einstein
had
speculated
that
was
zero
recent
<collocation>astronomical observations</collocation>
of
type
ia
supernovae
have
detected
a
large
amount
of
dark
energy
that
is
accelerating
the
universe
expansion


<collocation>preliminary studies</collocation>
suggest
that
this
dark
energy
is
related
to
a
positive

alternative
theories
can

<collocation>big bang</collocation>
model
main
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
the
prevailing
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
model
accounts
for
many
of
the
experimental
observations
described
above
such
as
the
correlation
of
distance
and
of
galaxies
the
universal
ratio
of
hydrogen
helium
atoms
and
the
ubiquitous
microwave
radiation
background


as
noted
above
the
arises
from
the
metric
expansion
of
space
as
the
space
itself
expands
the
wavelength
of
a
photon
traveling
through
space
likewise
increases
decreasing
its
energy


the
longer
a
photon
has
been
traveling
the
more
expansion
it
has
undergone
hence
older
photons
from
more
<collocation>distant galaxies</collocation>
are
the
most


determining
the
correlation
between
distance
and
is
an
important
problem
in
experimental
physical
cosmology


other
experimental
observations
can
be
explained
by
combining
the
overall
expansion
of
space
with
nuclear
and
atomic
physics


as
the
universe
expands
the
energy
density
of
the
electromagnetic
radiation
decreases
more
quickly
than
does
that
of
matter
since
the
energy
of
a
<collocation>photon decreases</collocation>
with
its
wavelength


thus
although
the
energy
density
of
the
universe
is
now
dominated
by
matter
it
was
once
dominated
by
radiation
poetically
speaking
all
was
light


as
the
universe
expanded
its
energy
density
decreased
and
it
became
cooler
as
it
did
so
the
elementary
particles
of
matter
could
associate
stably
into
ever
larger
combinations


thus
in
the
early
part
of
the
era
stable
protons
and
neutrons
formed
which
then
associated
into
atomic
nuclei


at
this
stage
the
matter
in
the
universe
was
mainly
a
hot
dense
plasma
of
negative
electrons
<collocation>neutral neutrinos</collocation>
and
positive
nuclei


nuclear
reactions
among
the
nuclei
led
to
the
present
of
the
lighter
nuclei
particularly
hydrogen
deuterium
and
helium


eventually
the
electrons
and
nuclei
combined
to
form
stable
atoms
which
are
transparent
to
most
wavelengths
of
radiation
at
this
point
the
radiation
from
the
matter
forming

ubiquitous
background
of
microwave
radiation
observed
today


chief
nuclear
reactions
responsible
for
the
relative
amounts
of
light
atomic
nuclei
observed
in
the
universe


other
observations
are
not
clearly
answered
by
known
physics


according
to
the
prevailing
theory
a
slight
imbalance
of
matter
over
antimatter
was
present
in
the
universe
creation
or
developed
very
shortly
thereafter


although
the
matter
and
antimatter
mostly
annihilated
one
another
producing
photons
a
small
residue
of
matter
survived
giving
the
present
universe


several
lines
of
evidence
also
suggest
that
a
<collocation>rapid cosmic</collocation>
inflation
of
the
universe
occurred
very
early
in
its
history
roughly
seconds
after
its
creation


recent
observations
also
suggest
that
the
cosmological
constant
is
not
zero
and
that
the
net
content
of
the
universe
is
dominated
by
a
dark
energy
and
dark
matter
that
have
not
been
characterized
scientifically


they
differ
in
their
gravitational
effects


dark
matter
as
ordinary
matter
does
and
thus
slows
the
expansion
of
the
universe
by
contrast
dark
energy
serves
to
accelerate
the

expansion

measurement
is
a
process
that
uses
numbers
to
describe
things
based
on
what
we
can
observe
about
them


this
is
done
to
be
able
to
compare
them
to
each
other


we
can
measure
how
big
things
are
how
warm
they
are
how
heavy
they
are
and
lots
of
other
features
as
well


units
of
measurement
provide
standards
for
our
comparisons
so
that
the
numbers
from
our
measurements
refer
to
the
same
thing


for
example
the
metre
is
a
standard
unit
to
measure
length


before
it
was
defined
as
the
distance
between
two
markers
on
a
special
rod


now
scientists
define
the
metre
as
a
fraction
of
the
speed
of
light


saying
something
has
a
length
of
metres
means
that
it
is
exactly
twice
as
long
as
that
rod
used
to
define
the
metre
or
that
light
takes
twice
the
time
defined
for
a
metre
to
travel
that
distance


today
most
units
of
measure
fall
into
one
of
three
systems


the
older
two
the
british
imperial
system
and
the
closely
related
us
customary
system
use
the
foot
as
a
measure
of
length
the
pound
as
a
measure
for
weight
and
the
second
as
a
measure
for
time


there
are
other
units
as
well


in
these
systems
the
number
of
smaller
units
that
make
the
bigger
units
varies


for
example
there
are
inches
in
a
foot
and
ounces
in
a
pound


a
newer
system
is
the
metric
system
or
si
system
which
usually
use
of
the
smaller
unit

number
and
unit
of
measure
the
property
of
the
thing
being
measured
is
given
as
a
number
of
units
of
measure


the
number
only
has
sense
when
the
unit
of
measurement
is
also
given


for
example
the
<collocation>eiffel tower</collocation>
in
paris
france
is
meters
tall


that
is
the
distance
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
of
the
<collocation>eiffel tower</collocation>
is
meters


the
property
of
the
<collocation>eiffel tower</collocation>
being
measured
is
a
distance


the
number
measured
is


this
number
does
not
make
sense
without
the
unit
of
measure


the
unit
of
measure
is
the
meter


measurement
<collocation>standards standards</collocation>
are
special
objects
that
are
used
to
make
measurements
in
terms
of
fixed
units
of
measurement


a
metre
stick
is
an
example
of
a
standard


when
you
measure
something
with
a
metre
stick
you
can
compare
that
measurement
to
anything
else
that
is
also
measured
with
a
metre
stick


this
makes
measurement
easier
and
comparisons
between
measurements
easier


size
of
units
of
measurement
there
are
units
of
measurement
of
different
sizes


there
are
small
units
of
measurement
to
measure
small
things


there
are
big
units
of
measurement
to
measure
big
things


science
medicine
and
engineering
use
smaller
units
of
measurement
to
measure
small
things
with
less
error


it
is
easier
to
measure
large
things
using
larger
units
of
measurement


large
measurements
like
the
width
of
a
galaxy
and
small
measurements
like
the
mass
of
an
atom
use
special
units
of
measurement


systems
of
units
of
measurement
there
are
many
different
standards
and
units
used
all
over
the
world


metric
system
see
si
and
metric
system
the
metric
system
is
a
system
of
measurement
used
in
most
of
the
world


it
is
also
called
the
international
system
of
units
or
si


units
of
measure
in
the
metric
system
include
the
units
of
length
or
linear
size
are
based
on
the
metre


they
include
the
kilometre
km
which
is
meters
the
centimetre
cm
and
the
millimetre
mm
which
is
of
a
meter


the
unit
of
volume
is
the
litre


it
is
used
for
measuring
an
amount
of
liquid


a
abbreviated
as
ml
is
the
amount
of
liquid
that
would
fill
up
a
cube
that
measures
centimetre
on
each
side


one
l
litre
of
liquid
would
fill
up
a
cube
that
is
cm
on
each
side


the
unit
of
mass
is
the
kilogram


a
kilogram
kg
weighs
the
same
as
a
litre
of
water
at
normal
temperature
and
pressure


gram
g
is
the
weight
of
of
water
at
degrees
celsius


the
<collocation>metric tonne</collocation>
is
kilograms
or
a
million
grams


british
imperial

imperial
units
imperial
units
were
defined
in
the
<collocation>united kingdom</collocation>
in


these
units
were
based
on
similar
units
that
were
in
use
before


imperial
units
were
used
in
countries
that
were
part
of
the
british
empire


while
many
of
these
countries

the

also
based

<collocation>united kingdom</collocation>
from
before
american
independence


but
some
of
the
units
are
different
to
the
british
ones


for
example
there
are
<collocation>imperial fluid</collocation>
ounces
in
an
<collocation>imperial pint</collocation>
but
us
fluid
ounces
in
a
us
pint


additionally
the
us
fluid
ounce
is
slightly
bigger
than
the
<collocation>imperial fluid</collocation>
ounce


the
result
is
that
us
pints
and
gallons
are
smaller
than
<collocation>imperial pints</collocation>
and
gallons


in
the
united
states
the
metric
system
has
been
legal
for
trade
since
but
other
measurements
such
as
the
