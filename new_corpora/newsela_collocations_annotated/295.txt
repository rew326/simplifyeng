specific
things
but
not
good
at
dealing
with
new
things
they
have
seen
before


for
example
a
common
computer
program
can
turn
a
report
of
names
and
hours
worked
into
paychecks
for
the
workers
at
a
company


but
the
same
program
could
not
answer
questions
from
an
employee
about
why
the
company
will
not
pay
for
nap
time


that
is
the
difference
between
a
program
and
ai


in
some
cases
ai
can
be
simulated
imitated
at
least
in
certain
areas


with
enough
effort
programmers
can
make
a
big
program
that
knows
about
many
things
and
can
answer
questions
about
those
things


programs
that
can
beat
humans
at
chess
have
been
around
for
a
long
time
but
that
not
true
ai
it
just
a
very
good
program
on
how
to
follow
strategy
to
win
at
chess


if
simulated
ai
is
asked
about
something
it
does
not
know
it
can
not
come
up
with
a
good
answer
based
on
other
things
it
already
knows


for
example
it
might
know
the
<collocation>weather forecast</collocation>
and
about
how
plants
grow
but
if
asked
if
the
grass
will
be
green
next
week
simulated
ai
will
not
ever
realize
it
needs
to
think
about
what
the
temperature
and
rainfall
will
be
for
the
next
week


a
true
ai
program
will
be
able
to
understand
how
to
answer
new
questions
like
that


to
work
in
a
world
where
answers
are
not
yes
or
no
but
also
maybe
likely
and
not
likely
researchers
have
worked
on
fuzzy
logic
and
neural
networks


sometimes
ai
is
meant
to
be
a
simulation
of
human
intelligence
often
as
a
part
of
research
in
the
area
of
psychology


in
this
case
it
is
the
study
of
mental
processes
through
the
use
of
<collocation>computer models</collocation>


the
question
of
what
it
means
to
be
or
having
consciousness
knowing
that
you
have
a
physical
body
and
how
you
think
about
your
self
is
part
of
it


if
a
computer
sees
itself
in
a
mirror
would
it
realize
what
it
sees


can
a
computer
be
scared
of
death


history
the
name
came
from
the
topic
of
a
college
conference
by
john


the
idea
of
thinking
machines
had
been
around
before
this


in
alan
wrote
a
paper
called
computing
machinery
and
intelligence


he
started
with
the
question
can
machines
think


since
thinking
is
hard
to
define
went
to
another
question
instead
can
machines
trick
a
human
into
thinking
they
are
talking
to
another
human
instead
of
to
a
machine
