a
mathematical
equation
is
a
formula
containing
an

sign
with
a
mathematical
expression
on
each
side
of
it


the
equals
sign
says
that
both
sides
are
exactly
the

value


an
equation
can
be
as
simple

there
are
two

the
kind
of
equation
that
lets
you
calculate
the

variables


the

is
only
true
if
the

you
would
