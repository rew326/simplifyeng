history
begins
when
there
is
a
written
record
and
writing
like
so
much
else
was
brought
to
britain
by
the
romans


rome
ruled
in
britain
from
to
but
they
ruled
only
england
and
wales


the
romans
never
ruled
scotland
north
of
the
valley
or
ireland
their
northern
boundary
varied
from
time
to
time
and
was
marked
for
a
while
at
wall


after
the
romans
two
waves
of
immigrants
came
to
britain


the
first
were
german
tribes
the
angles
saxons
and
jutes


english
the
language
is
a
development
from
old
english
and
is
a
germanic
language


the
second
were
the
vikings


britain
unified
after
a
long
period
when
england
was
split
into
various
kingdoms
it
was
finally
made
into
one
country
by
in
ad


england
and
wales
were
unified
by
edward
i
longshanks
by
force
in
the
century


this
union
is
known
as
britain


union
with
scotland
took
much
longer
there
were
hundreds
of
years
of
conflicts
between
the
two
countries


this
union
is
known
as
great
britain


in
when
queen
elizabeth
i
of
england
died
her
closest
relative
was
king
james
vi
of
scotland


he
became
king
of
england
as
well
as
king
of
scotland
but
the
two
countries
stayed
separate


in
the
scottish
and
english
parliaments
agreed
the
treaty
of
union
which
joined
the
two
countries
into
one
country
called
the
kingdom
of

britain
under
queen
anne


queen
elizabeth
has
reigned
since


by
both
scotland
and
england
had
already
independently
had
much
influence
over
ireland
for
over
years


in
that
year
laws
were
passed
in
great
britain
and
ireland
to
merge
the
two
states


the
new
country
was
called
the
<collocation>united kingdom</collocation>
of
great
britain
and
ireland


in
much
of
ireland
became
independent
as
the
irish
free
state
now
called
ireland
from
the
<collocation>united kingdom</collocation>


however
six
northern
counties
called
northern
ireland
continue
to
be
part
of
the
<collocation>united kingdom</collocation>


the
country
was
renamed
the

of

britain

northern
ireland


parliament
the

parliament
started
a
thousand
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
as
an
advisory
body
for
the
monarch
but
by
the
century
it
had
gained
enough
power
to
successfully
defeat
charles
i
in
the
english
civil
war


<collocation>oliver cromwell</collocation>
became
<collocation>lord protector</collocation>


though
the
monarchy
was
restored
after
his
death
the
crown
slowly
became
the
secondary
power
and
parliament
the
first


members
of
parliament
called

elected

until
the
early
twentieth
century
only
men
who
owned
property
could
vote


in
the
<collocation>nineteenth century</collocation>
more
people
were
given
suffrage
the
right
to
vote
but
even
so
by
women
could
not
vote
and
only
of
men
were
rich
enough
to

in

history
many
people
in
history
had
ideas
to
explain
the
universe


most
early
models
had
the
earth
at
the
center
of
the
universe


some
ancient
greeks
thought
that
the
universe
has
infinite
space
and
has
existed
forever


they
thought
it
had
a
set
of
spheres
which
corresponded
to
the
fixed
stars
the
sun
and
various
planets


the
spheres
circled
about
a
spherical
but
unmoving
earth


over
the
centuries
better
observations
and
better
ideas
of
gravity
led
to
copernicus
sun
centred
model


this
was
hugely
controversial
at
the
time
and
was
fought
long
and
hard
by
authorities
of
the
christian
church
see
and
galileo


the
invention
of
the
telescope
in
the
netherlands
was
a
milestone
in
astronomy


by
the
century
they
were
good
enough
for
other
galaxies
to
be
distinguished


the
modern
optical
uses
visible
light
telescope
is
still
more
advanced


meanwhile
the
newtonian
dynamics
equations
showed
how
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
worked


the
improvement
of
telescopes
led
astronomers
to
realize
that
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
is
in
a
galaxy
made
of
billions
of
stars
the
milky
way
and
that
other
galaxies
exist
outside
it
as
far
as
we
can
see


careful
studies
of
the
distribution
of
these
galaxies
and
their
<collocation>spectral lines</collocation>
have
led
to
much
of
modern
cosmology

to

they
formed
shortly
after
the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>


<collocation>big bang</collocation>
the
most
used
scientific
model
of
the
universe
is
known
as
the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
theory


the
universe
expanded
from
a
very
hot
dense
phase
called
the
epoch
in
which
all
the
matter
and
energy
of
the
universe
was
concentrated


several
independent
experimental
measurements
support
the
expansion
of
space
and
more
generally
the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
idea


recent
observations
support
the
idea
that
this
expansion
is
happening
because
of
dark
energy


most
of
the
matter
in
the
universe
may
be
in
a
form
which
can
not
be
detected
by
present
methods


this
has
been
named
dark
matter


just
to
be
clear
dark
matter
and
energy
have
not
been
detected
directly
that
is
why
they
are
called
dark


their
existence
is
inferred
by
deduction
from
observations
which
would
be
difficult
to
explain
otherwise


current
thinking
in
cosmology
is
that
the
age
of
the
universe
is
billion
years
and
that
the
diameter
of
the
universe
is
at
least
billion
light
years
or
e
metres


according
to
general
relativity
space
can
get
bigger
faster
than
the
speed
of
light
but
we
can
view
only
part
of
the
universe
because
of
the
speed
of
light


we
can
not
see
space
beyond
the
limitations
of
light
or
any
electromagnetic
radiation


etymology
synonyms
and
meaning
the
word
universe
comes
from
the
old
french
word
which
comes
from
the
latin
word


the
latin
word
was
used
by
cicero
and
later
latin
authors
in
many
of
the
same
senses
as
the
modern
english
word
is
used


a
different
interpretation
way
to
interpret
of
is
everything
rotated
as
one
or
everything
rotated
by
one


this
refers
to
an
early
greek
model
of
the
universe


in
that
model
all
matter
was
in
rotating
spheres
centered
on
the
earth
according
to
aristotle
the
rotation
of
the
<collocation>outermost sphere</collocation>
was
responsible
for
the
motion
and
change
of
everything
within


it
was
natural
for
the
greeks
to
assume
that
the
earth
was
stationary
and
that
the
heavens
rotated
about
the
earth
because
<collocation>careful astronomical</collocation>
and
physical
measurements
such
as
the
pendulum
are
required
to
prove
otherwise


the
most
common
term
for
universe
among
the
ancient
greek
philosophers
from
<collocation>pythagoras onwards</collocation>
was
the
all
defined
as
all
matter
and
all
space


broadest
meaning
the
broadest
word
meaning
of
the
universe
is
found
in
de
by
the
medieval
philosopher
johannes
who
defined
it
as
simply
everything
everything
that
exists
and
everything
that
does
not
exist


time
is
not
considered
in
definition
thus
his
definition
includes
everything
that
exists
has
existed
and
will
exist
as
well
as
everything
that
does
not
exist
has
never
existed
and
will
never
exist


this
definition
was
not
adopted
by
most
later
philosophers
but
something
similar
is
in
quantum
physics


definition
as
reality
see
also
reality
physics
usually
the
universe
is
thought
to
be
everything
that
exists
has
existed
and
will
exist


this
definition
says
that
the
universe
is
made
of
two
elements
space
and
time
together
known
as
or
the
vacuum
and
matter
and
different
forms
of
energy
and
momentum
occupying


the
two
kinds
of
elements
behave
according
to
physical
laws
in
which
we
describe
how
the
elements
interact
