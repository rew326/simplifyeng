sides


some
people
in
kyoto
believe
that
these

complex
date
february
the
symbol
of
anarchy
anarchy
from
greek
meaning
without
also
used
as


it
is
a
word
that
has
more
than
one
use


some
of
its
uses
are
when
there
is
no
leader
or
when
nobody
has
power
over
everyone
used
just
in
the
anarchist
movement


when
there
is
no
political
order
and
there
is
confusion
used
often
from
mass
media
when
persons
do
not
have
any
reason
to
work
together
or
do
not
have
anything
that
makes
them
feel
like
a
group


in
the
first
use
an
anarchy
might
be
a
or
real
society
based
on
a
group
beliefs
about
anarchism
see


in
the
second
use
anarchy
has
to
do
with
having
no
political
order


the
cia
world
says
that
there
is
only
one
nation
somalia
that
is
in
a
state
of
anarchy


in
somalia
the
government
is
no
longer
in
control
and
some
parts
of
the
country
are
ruled
by
mobs
and
warlords
who
sometimes
fight
one
another


there
are
a
small
number
of
other
places
afghanistan
albania
burundi
and
and
where
government
is
emerging
or
transitional
and
were
in
in
the
near
past


the
dc
says
that
the
solomon
islands
is
tending
towards
because
violence
corruption
and
crime
have
undermined
stability
and
civil
society


another
use
of
the
word
anarchy
is
when
it
is
said
as
the
anarchy


this
is
the
name
that
is
sometimes
given
to
the
civil
war
and
unsettled
government
in
england
when
stephen
of
england
was
king


when
there
is
no
political
order
more
than
one
government
or
political
authority
might
sometimes
compete
for
the
same
food
oil
land
or
groups
of
people


the
word
anarchy
to
used
to
describe
this


however
because
there
is
more
than
one
competing
authority
a
better
word
might
be


the
difference
between
anarchy
and
is
important
to
someone
who
thinks
that
true
anarchy
would
work
well


the
word
for
someone
who
thinks
this
is
anarchist
and
the
word
for
this
kind
of
thinking
is
anarchism


anarchism
has
been
thought
about
for
hundreds
of
years


anarchy
which
follows
the
death
of
a
ruler
and
ceases
when
his
successor
rises
to
power
is
called
literally
rules


where
the
word
comes
from
the
word
anarchy
comes
from
the
greek
word
which
means
without
a
leader


while
the
popular
understanding
of
anarchism
is
of
a
violent
movement
anarchism
is
a
much
more
subtle
and
<collocation>nuanced tradition</collocation>
then
a
simple
opposition
to
government
power


anarchists
oppose
the
idea
that
power
and
domination
are
necessary
for
society
and
instead
advocate
more
forms
of
social
political
and
economic
organization

only
pairs
with
t

only
pairs
with
g


the
bases
are
held
together
by
hydrogen
bonds


adenine
a
and
thymine
t
can
pair
up
because
they
make
two
hydrogen
bonds
and
cytosine
c

pair
up
to
make
three
hydrogen

although
the
bases
are
always
in
fixed
pairs
the
pairs
can
come
in
any
order
or
similarly
or


this
way
can
write
codes
out
of
the
letters
that
are
the
bases


these
codes
contain
the
message
that
tells
the

what
to

on
chromosomes
the
is
bound
up
with
proteins
called
to
form


this
association
takes
part
in
and
<collocation>gene regulation</collocation>


genes
are
switched
on
and
off
during
development
and
cell
activity
and
this
regulation
is
the
basis
of
most
of
the
activity
which
takes
place
in
cells


copying
when
is
copied
this
is
called
replication


briefly
the
hydrogen
bonds
holding
together
<collocation>paired bases</collocation>
are
broken
and
the
molecule
is
split
in
half
the
legs
of
the
ladder
are
separated


this
gives
two
single
strands


new
strands
are
formed
by
matching
the
bases
a
with
t
and
g
with
c
to
make
the
missing
strands


first
an
enzyme
called
splits
the
down
the
middle
by
breaking
the
hydrogen
bonds


then
after
the
molecule
is
in
two
separate
pieces
another
molecule
called
makes
a
new
strand
that
matches
each
of
the
strands
of
the
split
molecule


each
copy
of
a
molecule
is
made
of
half
of
the
original
starting
molecule
and
half
of
new
bases


mutations
when
is
copied
mistakes
are
sometimes
made
these
are
called
mutations


there
are
three
main
types
of
mutations
deletion
where
one
or
more
bases
are
left
out


substitution
where
one
or
more
bases
are
substituted
for
another
base
in
the
sequence


insertion
where
one
or
more
extra
base
is
put
in


duplication
where
a
sequence
of
bases
pairs
are
repeated


mutations
may
also
be
classified
by
their
effect
on
the
structure
and
function
of
proteins
or
their
effect
on
fitness


mutations
may
be
bad
for
the
organism
or
neutral
or
of
benefit


sometimes
mutations
are
fatal
for
the
organism
the
protein
made
by
the
new
does
not
work
at
all
and
this
causes
the
embryo
to
die


on
the
other
hand
evolution
is
moved
forward
by
mutations
when
the
new
version
of
the
protein
works
better
for
the
organism


protein
synthesis
a
section
of
that
contains
instructions
to
make
a
protein
is
called
a
gene


each
gene
has
the
sequence
for
at
least
one


proteins
form
structures
and
also
form
enzymes


the
enzymes

most
of
the
work
in
cells


proteins

made
out
of
smaller
which
are
formed
of
amino

make
a
protein
to
do
a
particular
job
the

history
of
research
james
watson
and
francis
crick
right
with

was
first
isolated
extracted
from
cells
by
swiss
physician
in
when
he
was
working
on
bacteria
from
the
pus
in
surgical
bandages


the
molecule
was
found
in
the
nucleus
of
the
cells
and
so
he
called
it


in
frederick
discovered
that
traits
of
the
smooth
form
of
could
be
transferred
to
the
rough
form
of
the
same
bacteria
by
mixing
killed
smooth
bacteria
with
the
live
rough
form


this
system
provided
the
first
clear
suggestion
that
carries
genetic
information


the
experiment
identified
as
the
transforming
principle
in


role
in
heredity
was
confirmed
in
when
<collocation>alfred hershey</collocation>
and
martha
chase
in
the
hershey
chase
experiment
showed
that
is
the
genetic
material
of
the
bacteriophage


in
the
found
that
the
amount
of
thymine
t
present
in
a
molecule
of
was
about
equal
to
the
amount
of
adenine
a
present


he
found
that
the
same
applies
to
guanine
g
and
cytosine
c


rules
this
finding


in
james
watson
and
francis
crick
suggested
what
is
now
accepted
as
the
first
correct
model
of
structure
in
the
journal
nature


their
molecular
model
of
was
then
based
on
a
single
diffraction
image
photo
taken
by
<collocation>rosalind franklin</collocation>
and
gosling
in
may


experimental
evidence
supporting
the
watson
and
crick
model
was
published
in
a
series
of
five
articles
in
the
same
issue
of
nature


of
these
franklin
and
gosling
paper
was
the
first
publication
of
their
own
diffraction
data
and
original
analysis
method
that
partly
supported
the
watson
and
crick
model
this
issue
also
contained
an
article
on
structure
by
and
two
of
his
colleagues
whose
analysis
and
in
vivo
patterns
also
supported
the
presence
in
vivo
of
the
configurations
as
proposed
by
crick
and
watson
for
their
molecular
model
of
in
the
previous
two
pages
of

in
after
franklin
death
watson
crick
and
jointly
received
the
nobel
prize
in
physiology
or
medicine


nobel
prizes
were
awarded
only
to
living
recipients
at
the
time


a
debate
continues
about
who
should
receive
credit
for
the
discovery


in
crick
explained
the
relationship
between
and
proteins
in
the

of

more
work
by

showed
that

called


these
findings
represent
the
birth

marx
thought
that
this
<collocation>class struggle</collocation>
would

the
book

his
ideas
are

his
most
important
work
is
das
or
the
capital


he
spent
many
years
working
on
the
three
parts
of
the
book


das
describes
how
capitalism
works
and
the
problems
this
creates
such
as
division
of
labor
and
exploitation


the
book
has
led
to
many
arguments
between
those
who
agree
with
the
book
and
those
who
do
not


marx
ideas
have
been
thought
of
as
responsible

like
the
russian

marx
most
popular
theory
was
his
materialism


he
believed
that

things
are
all
rooted

in

later
life
he
was
more

marx
was
born
in

he
had
to
move
many
times

bread
at
a
bakery
different
types
of
<collocation>bread bread</collocation>
is
a
type
of
baked
food


it
is
mainly
made
from
dough
which
is
made
mainly
from
flour
and
water


usually
salt
and
yeast
are
added


bread
is
often
baked
in
an
oven


bread
can
be
toasted
or
used
to
make
sandwiches


pizza
is
a
food
based
on
bread


there
are
many
different
kinds
of
bread


the
two
main
types
of
bread
are
leavened
bread
is
made
by
adding
yeast
or
other
leavening
to
the
dough


the
yeast
produces
gas
that
makes
the
<collocation>dough lighter</collocation>


leavened
bread
can
be
made
into
<collocation>larger loaves</collocation>
baked
in
an
oven


this
is
the
main
type
of
bread
eaten
in
europe
america
and
many
parts
of
asia


unleavened
is
baked
from
a
dough
of
water
and
flour
with
no
yeast


it
is
baked
in
flat
rounds
like
tortilla
or


this
type
of
bread
can
not
be
made
thick
as
it
would
be
too
dense
to
eat


<collocation>unleavened bread</collocation>
is
eaten
throughout
the
middle
east
africa
parts
of
asia
and
as
the
central
american
tortilla


baking
can
be
done
on
a
metal
plate
or
hot
stone
or
in
an
oven


the
color
and
taste
of
the
bread
depend
on
the
kind
of
flour
used
and
the
style
of
baking


flour
made
from
the
whole
grain
gives
darker
bread


flour
made
just
from
the
polished
wheat
grain
gives
a
very
white
bread


rye
and
<collocation>barley flour</collocation>
give
darker
types
of
bread


the
type
of
flour
also
changes
how
long
the
bread
can
be
kept
before
going
bad


some
strains
of
wheat
are
resistant
to
fungus
but
may
not
produce
a
bread
as
tasty
as
a
weaker
strain


<collocation>religious breads</collocation>
christianity
and
judaism
have
rules
about
the
use
of
bread
in
their
religions


<collocation>unleavened bread</collocation>
is
eaten
by
jews
during
the
passover


the
catholic
celebration
of
the
eucharist
uses
unleavened
wafers


<collocation>orthodox churches</collocation>
forbid
the
use
of
<collocation>unleavened bread</collocation>
for
the
eucharist
<collocation>old testament</collocation>
and
permit
leavened
bread
only
as
a
symbol
of
the
new


this

one
of

bread
is
an
important
part
of
life
in
many
countries
because
so
many
people

many
cultures

is
so
important
that
it
is
part
of
religious
rituals

a
form

japanese


they
believe
there
are
many
kami

gods
or
nature

some
are
the

from
the
japanese
words
lang
ja

word
for
god

word
for

way
or

means
the
way
of
the
gods

the
main
religion
of
japan
before
