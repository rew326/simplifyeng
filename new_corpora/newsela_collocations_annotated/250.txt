properties
sulfur
is
a
yellow
solid
that
is
a


it
is
brittle
easily
broken
and
crystalline


it
burns
easily
releasing
toxic
fumes
of
<collocation>sulfur dioxide</collocation>


it
has
a
very
faint
odor


if
it
is
melted
and
cooled
very
quickly
it
makes
a
rubbery
form
of
sulfur
that
is
called
plastic
sulfur


it
gradually
turns
back
into
the
yellow
brittle
form


it
does
not
dissolve
in
water


the
smell
normally
known
as
sulfur
comes
from
hydrogen
sulfide
and
similar
chemicals


these
sulfides
are
produced
when

decay
without

sulfur
comes
in
several

oxidation

aluminium
or

a
<collocation>chemical element</collocation>


the

is

properties
aluminium
is
a
very
good
conductor
of
electricity
and
heat


it
is
light
and
strong


it
can
be
hammered
into
sheets
malleable
or
pulled
out
into
wires
ductile


it
is
a
highly
reactive
metal
although
it
is
<collocation>corrosion resistant</collocation>


aluminium
prevents
corrosion
by
forming
a
small
thin
layer
of
<collocation>aluminium oxide</collocation>
on
its
surface


this
layer
protects
the
metal
by
preventing
oxygen
from
reaching
it


corrosion
can
not
occur
without
oxygen


because
of
this
thin
layer
the
of
aluminium
is
not
seen


occurrence
and
<collocation>preparation pure</collocation>
aluminium
is
made
from
bauxite
a
kind
of
rock
that
has
<collocation>aluminium oxide</collocation>
and
many
impurities


the
bauxite
is
crushed
and
reacted
with
<collocation>sodium hydroxide</collocation>


the
<collocation>aluminium oxide</collocation>
dissolves


then
the
<collocation>aluminium oxide</collocation>
is
dissolved
in
liquid
a
rare
mineral


is
normally
produced
artificially
though


the
<collocation>aluminium oxide</collocation>
is
to
make
aluminium
and
oxygen


aluminium
was
once
considered
a
precious
metal
that
was
even
more
valuable
than
gold


this
is
no
longer
true
because
as
technology
improved
it
became
cheaper
and
easier
to
make
pure
metal


<collocation>compounds aluminium</collocation>
forms
chemical
compounds
in
the
oxidation
state


they
are
generally


aluminium
chloride
and
<collocation>aluminium oxide</collocation>
examples


very
rarely
are
compounds
in
the
or
oxidation
state


uses
aluminium
has
many
uses


much
of
it
is
used
in
overhead
power
cables


it
is
also
widely
used
in
<collocation>window frames</collocation>
and
aircraft
bodies


it
is
found
at
home
as
saucepans
soft
drink
cans
and
<collocation>cooking foil</collocation>


aluminium
is
also
used
to
coat
<collocation>car headlamps</collocation>
and
<collocation>compact discs</collocation>


<collocation>pure aluminium</collocation>
is
very
soft
so
a
harder
metal
is
almost
always
added


the
harder
metal
is
usually
copper


alloys
are
to
make
ships
because
the
aluminium
prevents
corrosion
and
the
copper
prevents
barnacles


aluminium
compounds
are
used
in
deodorants
water
processing
plants
food
additives
and
antacids


recycling
since
aluminium
needs
to
be
made
by
electrolysis
it
requires
a
very
large
amount
of
electrical
power


recycling
aluminium
would
be
much
cheaper


that
why
recycling
plants
were
opened


the
cost
of
recycling
aluminium
is
much
less
than
the
cost
of
making
it
from
bauxite


toxicity
aluminium
is
not
used
in
the
human
body
although
it
is
very
common


people
debate
whether
its
use
in
deodorants
and
water
treatment
is
healthy


aluminium
ions
slow
down
plant
growth
in
<collocation>acidic soils</collocation>


aluminium
may
be
a
factor
in
alzheimer
disease
a
disease
when
the
brain
stops
working
and
the
patient
is
confused


but
the
alzheimer
society
says
overwhelming
medical
and
scientific
opinion
is
that
studies
have
not
convincingly
demonstrated
a
causal
relationship
between
aluminium
and
alzheimer
disease

history
texas
was
first
explored
in
by
spanish
explorers
on
accident
they
arrived
when
their
ship
sank
off
the
coast


it
did
not
become
a
colony
until
when
france
claimed
it


in
response
spain
set
up
a
rival
colony
in
by
setting
up
a
religious
outpost
in
the
eastern
part
of
texas


spain
did
not
come
back
to
texas
until
to
protect
its
colonies
in
the
west
from
french
forces


two
years
later
san
antonio
was
started


the
pressure
between
the
spaniards
and
<collocation>native americans</collocation>
in
east
texas
stopped
many
settlers
from
coming
to
texas


to
stop
the
violence
and
the
increasing
native
american
raids
spain
called
a
truce
between
many
tribes
in
and


tensions
rose
in
texas
after
the
united
states
bought
a
large
amount
of
nearby
land
from
france
in


this
land
was
called
the
louisiana
purchase


people
began
wondering
whether
spain
or
the
united
states
could
claim
texas


when
mexico
got
independence
from
spain
in
texas
became
part
of
mexico


americans
and
other
settlers
came
into
texas
when
mexico
allowed
settlers
to
settle
here


after
many
settlers
came
to
texas
mexico
started
taxing


this
outraged
many
settlers


those
from
the
south
were
even
more
outraged
because
mexico
banned
all
slavery
in
many
southerners
saw
slavery
as
a
way
of
life
back
then


on
march
texas
declared
independence
from
mexico
and
soon
they
were
at
war


texas
won
but
mexico
refused
to
recognize
texas
as
an
independent


texas
soon
asked
to
become
a
state
of
the
united
states


years
later
in
the
us
added
texas
as
a
state
and
mexico
broke
off
<collocation>diplomatic relations</collocation>


mexico
resisted
offers
by
the
to
buy
land
extending
from
texas
to
the
pacific
ocean


in
a
dispute
over
the
border
between
texas
and
mexico
resulted
in
armed
conflict
and
the
war
began


the
united

won
the
war

won
lands
that
later
formed
the
states
of
california
arizona

mexico
received

dollars
and
gave
up
its
claims
to
texas


after

was
elected
president
of

texas
joined
the
newly

fought
in

civil
war
in

the

texas

on

silesia
west
prussia
