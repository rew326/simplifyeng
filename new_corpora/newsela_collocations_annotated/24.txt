e
prime
it
means
english
prime
is
a
way
of
speaking
english
without
using
the
verb
to
be
in
any
way
be
is
am
are
was
were
been
and
being


instead
an
e
prime
speaker
or
writer
uses
different
verbs
like
to
become
to
remain
and
to
equal
or
they
might
choose
to
rearrange
the
sentence
to
show
that
the
thing
does
not
actually
act


for
example
in
e
prime
a
writer
would
change
the
statement
mistakes
were
made
to
joe
made
mistakes


this
change
in
wording
reveals
an
actor
joe
where
the
previous
form
concealed
the
actor


users
of
e
prime
would
consider
the
changed
sentence
more
accurate


what
e
prime
is
david
first
suggested
e
prime
in


had
studied
the
discipline
way
of
thinking
of
general
semantics


the
main
idea
of
general
semantics
is
that
people
can
only
know
what
they
observe
and
experience
when
they
see
hear
touch
taste
smell
think
and
feel
and
furthermore
that
what
they
observe
and
experience
can
affect
how
they
observe
and
experience
in
the
future


because
each
person
has
different
experiences
throughout
their
lives
they
interpret
their
experiences
differently


students
of
general
semantics
and
users
of
e
prime
contend
that
to
say
this
cat
is
soft
leaves
out
many
other
attributes
and
implies
that
the
outside
object
of
the
cat
is
the
same
as
the
inside
experience
of
softness


instead
e
prime
users
say
this
cat
feels
soft
to
me
to
remind
themselves
of
the
following
that
their
experience
of
softness
involves
both
the
outside
object
called
cat
and
the
eyes
hands
brain
and
nervous
system
of
the
observer


that
someone
else
might
experience
different
aspects
of
the
cat


that
they
themselves
might
experience
something
different
at
a
different
time
or
in
different
circumstances


the
cat
might
scratch
them
or
look
or
feel
wet
or
matted
with
dirt


what
e
prime
is
not
although
languages
like
russian
arabic
turkish
and
cantonese
do
not
always
use
a
separate
verb
for
to
be
they
do
have
the
idea
of
being


for
example
an
english
speaker
might
say
this
apple
is
red


an
arabic
speaker
might
say
this
apple
red


most
languages
can
be
used
to
express
the
idea
of
a
red
apple


an
e
prime
user
chooses
to
only
say
that
this
apple
looks
red
to
me
to
remind
themselves
that
seeing
red
involves
both
the
apple
and
the
eye
and
brain
of
the
person
looking
at
the
apple


many
teachers
of
english
encourage
students
to
use
verbs
other
than
to
be


to
them
using
more
active
verbs
makes
writing
clearer
and
more
interesting


these
teachers
want
to
improve
their
students
writing
and
may
not
agree

he
can
still

by

the

is
giving

they

we

when

in

put

and
political
priorities
as
the
way
to
achieve
better

to

when

subjects
and
objects
in
economics
the
subjects
in
economic
study
are
households
business
companies
the
government
the
state
and
foreign
countries


households
offer
their
factors
of
production
to
companies


this
includes
work
land
capital
machines
buildings
and
information


they
get
income
which
they
use
to
buy
or
consume
goods


business
companies
produce
and
sell
goods
and
buy
factors
of
production
from
households
and
from
other
companies


the
state
or
public
sector
includes
institutions
and
organizations


the
state
takes
some
of
the
earnings
from
the
business
companies
and
households
and
uses
it
to
pay
for
public
goods
like
streets
or
education
to
be
available
for
everyone


the
last
subject
is
foreign
countries
this
includes
all
households
business
companies
and
state
institutions
which
are
not
based
in
one
own
country


they
demand
and
supply
goods
from
abroad


the
objects
in
economic
study
are
<collocation>consumer goods</collocation>
capital
goods
and
factors
of
production


<collocation>consumer goods</collocation>
are
classified
as
usage
goods
for
example
gasoline
or
toilet
paper
as
purpose
goods
for
example
a
house
or
bicycle
and
as
services
for
example
the
work
of
a
doctor
or
<collocation>cleaning lady</collocation>


capital
goods
are
goods
which
are
necessary
for
producing
other
goods


examples
of
these
are
buildings
equipment
and
machines


factors
of
production
are
work
ground
capital
information
and
environment


general
economic
rules
all
people
have
to
decide
between
their
options


the
cost
of
a
goods
is
what
a
person
gives
up
for
the
goods


when
a
person
gives
up
something
like
money
to
get
a
good
he
also
gives
up
other
things
that
he
could
have
gotten
instead


the
true
cost
of
something
is
what
you
give
up
to
get
it


this
includes
the
money
spent
in
buying
or
doing
something
but
also
the
economic
benefits
utility
that
you
did
get
because
you
bought
or
did
that
thing
and
can
no
longer
buy
or
do
something
else


this
is
called
opportunity
cost


people
react
to
incentives


making
an
option
more
attractive
will
make
more
people
choose
it


markets
are
usually
good
for
the
organization
of
economic
life


in
the
free
market
goods
will
be
shared
by
people
and
companies
making
small
decisions


the
invisible
hand
of
the
market
adam
smith
states
that
if
everyone
tries
to
get
what
they
want
everyone
will
be
as
as
they
could
possibly
be


sometimes
prices
do
not
fully
show
the
cost
or
benefit
to
society


for
example
air
pollution
is
bad
for
society
and
education
is
good
for
society


the
government
can
put
a
tax
or
do
something
to
reduce
sales
on
items
that
are
bad
for
society


it
can
also
support
like
giving
money
for
items
that
are
good
for
society


the
living
standard
of
a
country
depends
on
the
skills
to
produce
services
and
goods


productivity
is
the
amount
of
the
produced
goods
divided
by
total
working
hours


when
there
is
an
increase
in
the
total
money
supply
or

main
branches
of
economics
are
microeconomics
and
macroeconomics


macroeconomics
is
about
the

if
a
country
wealth

or
if
millions
of
people
become

is
about
smaller

as
how
families
and
households

the
element
sulphur
has
a
crystalline
structure
bromine
is
one
of
only
two
elements
that
are
liquid
at
the
other
is
mercury
a
<collocation>chemical element</collocation>
is
a
substance
that
contains
only
one
type
of
atom


an
element
is
the
smallest
amount
of
a
substance
can
still
keep
its
properties


if
a
substance
contains
more
than
one
type
of
atom
it
is
a
compound


an
element
can
be
a
solid
liquid
or
gas


the
smallest
particle
of
such
an
element
is
an
atom


atoms
are
made
up
of
protons
neutrons
and
electrons


element
contains
only
one
kind
of
atom


the
number
of
protons
in
the
atoms
of
an
element
is
known
as
that
element
atomic
number


for
example
all
atoms
with
protons
in
their
nuclei
are
of
the
<collocation>chemical element</collocation>
carbon
and
all
atoms
with
protons
in
their
nuclei
are
of
the
element
uranium


elements
are
the
basic
building
blocks
for
all
types
of
substances


when
they
are
combined
with
each
other
they
can
form
molecules


different
chemical
elements
are
known
to
modern
chemistry


of
these
elements
can
be
found
in
nature
and
the
human
body
is
made
up
of
elements


the
others
can
only
be
made
in
laboratories


the
last
natural
element
discovered
was
uranium
in


the
first
element
was
technetium
in


chemical
elements
are
commonly
arranged
in
the
<collocation>periodic table</collocation>


where
the
elements
are
in
the
table
tells
us
about
their
properties
relative
to
the
other

chemical
symbols
chemical
elements
are
also
given
a
unique
chemical
symbol


chemical
symbols
are
used
all
over
the
world


this
means
that
no
matter
which
language
is
spoken
there
is
no
confusion
about
what
the
symbol
means
