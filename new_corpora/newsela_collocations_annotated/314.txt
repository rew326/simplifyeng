messiah
or
the
anointed
one
is
the
figure
promised
by
god
to
the
jews
for
the
salvation
of
the
world


the
jews
think
that
the
messiah
will
be
a
human
being
that
will
save
israel
and
lead
the
whole
world
into
the
end
of
days
and
eternal
peace


other
people
in
real
life
or
fiction
are
called
messianic
if
they
have
the
qualities
of
a
messiah
or
people
think
they
will
bring
about
a
better
world


the
how
where
and
why
why
jews
believe
the
biblical
prophets
inspired
by
god
to
tell
of
his
coming


during
the
period
of
the
roman
rule
in
century
the
idea
of
the
messiah
became
very
important
in
jewish
thought
and
teaching


according
to
the
scriptures
the
messiah
would
rescue
the
people
from
the
romans
and
restore
the
country


where
it
is
not
known
but
most
jews
believe
that
messiah
will
come
to
israel


how
there
are
many
of
ideas
about
how
the
messiah
will
come
judge

or
a

jesus
as
the
messiah
christianity
which
began
in
israel
with
jewish
followers
of
jesus
hebrew
holds
that
the
messiah
foretold
by
the
jewish
scriptures
is
jesus
and
that
in
fulfillment
of
prophecy
jesus
died
for
the
sins
of
the
world
rose
from
the
dead
and
lives
today
seated
at
the
right
hand
of
god
until
his
return


most
jews
do
not
hold
these
beliefs
those
who
do
are
sometimes
called
<collocation>messianic jews</collocation>


some
<collocation>messianic jews</collocation>
and
other
christians
see
the
fact
that
a
majority
of
jews
do
not
hold
these
beliefs
as
a
fulfillment
of
prophecy


see
epistle
to
the
romans
chapter
muslims
believe
that
jesus
was
the
son
of
mary
that
he
was
a
mighty
prophet
of
god
and
that
he
was
the
messiah
though
in
islam
the
messiah
has
a
different
role
than
he
does
in
christianity
or
judaism


they
believe
that
he
will
come
again
