history
the
first
time
we
know
an
actor
worked
was
in
probably
on
november


the
changes
in
calendar
between
then
and
now
means
that
we
are
not
sure
it
was
november


this
actor
was
called
and
he
was
greek


the
place
where
the
play
happened
was
called
the
theatre
dionysus


he
was
the
first
person
to
speak
words
as
a
character


this
was
a
big
change
in
storytelling


before
then
people
sang
and
danced
stories
but
no
one
had
been
a
person
in
the
story


today
we
call
actors
thespians
because
of


naming
in
the
past
the
name
actor
was
only
for
men


women
only
began
performing
often
in
the
century


when
they
began
people
called
them
the
actresses


in
the
ancient
world
and
in
the
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>
people
thought
it
was
bad
shameful
for
a
woman
to
act


people
thought
this
until
the
century


in
the
time
of
william
shakespeare
men
and
boys
played
women
roles
but
women
may
have
acted
secretly
