supply
is
the
amount
that
is
available
of
something
based
on
a
price


in
economics
the
law
of
supply
and
demand
will
decide
the
price
at
which
something
will
be
bought
and
sold


demand
is
the
total
amount
of
goods
or
services
which
people
want
to
buy
for
a
set
price


the
demand
for
an
item
indicates
how
much
it
is
needed
or
wanted


this
is
important
in
economics
because
the
law
of
supply
and
demand
will
decide
the
price
at
which
something
will
be
bought
and
sold


demand
is
the
amount
of
goods
that
people
want
to
buy
at
a
given
price


prices
go
up
when
supply
is
less
and
demand
is
more


it
follows
the
law
of
demand
where
as
price
increases
<collocation>demand decreases</collocation>
and
vice
versa
showing
an
inverse
relationship
between
quantity
demanded
and
price


this
is
known
as
the
law
of
demand
which
assumes
that
the
consumer
is
alive


sometimes
the
demand
does
not
change
much
no
matter
what
the
price
is


one
example
is
when
people
are
addicted
to
illegal
drugs


these
people
need
to
get
their
drugs
they
will
pay
any
price
they
can
afford


this
effect
is
known
as

actually
you
can
say
that
the

was
only
an
extension
to

the

be

<collocation>excellent reference</collocation>
book
and
to
provide
learning
materials
for
those
who
want
to
study


in
the
edition
had
a
third
wish
to
put
together
all
that
everyone
knows


the
history
of
the
britannica
can
be
divided
into
five
main
eras
or
lengths
of
time


first
era
in
its
first
years
editions
the
britannica
was
controlled
by
the
people
who
first
wrote
it
colin
and
andrew
bell
and
by
their
friends
and
relations
such
as
thomas
george
and
constable


the
britannica
was
first
published
between
and
in
edinburgh
a
city
in
scotland
called
the
britannica
or
a
dictionary
of
arts
and
sciences
compiled
upon
a
new
plan


it
was
written
to
replace
the
french


its
logo
which
is
the
floral
emblem
of
scotland
shows
that
the
britannica
was
a
scottish
business


the
encyclopedia
being
created
is
one
of
the
most
famous
events
that
happened
in
the
time
when
scotland
started
inventing
many
things
or
the
age
of
enlightenment


the
britannica
started
as
set
in
the
edition
written
by
one
young
editor
william
slowly
the
britannica
changed
in
the
first
era
to
a
set
written
by
many
people


although
a
few
other
had
been
fighting
with
the
britannica
such
as
rees
and
encyclopaedia
these
encyclopedias
either
went
bankrupt
or
were
not
finished
because
the
people
writing
them
argued


when
the
first
era
was
almost
over
the
britannica
had
many
people
helping
to
write
it
all
having
different
types
of
skills


the
encyclopedia
managed
to
get
so
many
people
by
inviting
their
friends
to
help


the
middle
century
editions
of
britannica
included
important
research
such
as
thomas
young
article
on
egypt
which
included
the
translation
of
the
hieroglyphs
on
the
stone
pictured


second
era
in
the
second
era
editions
the
britannica
was
owned
by
the
edinburgh
company
a
c
black


although
some
of
the
people
who
helped
write
the
britannica
helped
because
they
were
friends
of
the
most
important
editors
many
other
people
wanted
to
help
the
britannica
because
it
was
becoming
very
successful


these
people
came
from
many
other
countries
and
some
of
them
were
very
famous
for
the
things
they
wrote
about


an
index
of
all
the
articles
was
written
to
add
to
the
edition
of
the
encyclopedia
and
they
continued
to
make
an
index
until


the
first
english
chief
editor
was
thomas
spencer
who
led
the
making
of
the
famous
edition
which
is
also
called
the
scholar
edition


the
edition
is
considered
to
be
the
britannica
most
meant
for
students
ever
written


however
at
the
end
of
the
century
the
edition
was
already
too
old
and
the
britannica
had
many
financial
problems


third
era
advertisement
for
the
edition
from
the
may
issue
of
national
geographic
magazine
in
the
third
era
editions
the
britannica
was
owned
by
american
people
who
started
to
advertise
a
lot
to
earn
more
money


the
american
owners
also
slowly
made
the
britannica
articles
simpler
so
it
could
serve
more
people


the
edition
is
said
by
many
people
to
be
the
best
edition
of
the
encyclopedia


its
owner
<collocation>horace hooper</collocation>
worked
extremely
hard
to
make
the
edition
perfect


when
hooper
had
financial
problems
the
britannica
was
managed
by
sears
roebuck
for
about
years


in
the
of
sears
harrison
owned
the
britannica


in
he
started
to
continuously
revise
the
encyclopedia
often
still
done
so
today
in
which
every
article
is
checked
at
least
two
times
every
ten
years


this
was
a
big
difference
from
before
when
the
articles
were
not
changed
until
they
wrote
a
new
edition
about
every
years
with
some
articles
used
again
without
revising
them


he
also
quickly
made
some
educational
products
which
made
the
encyclopedia
even
more
well
known
by
everyone


in
william
managed
the
britannica
until
his
death
in


also
set
up
the
foundation
which
managed
the
britannica
until


in
near
the
end
of
this
era
the
britannica
celebrated
its
year
anniversary


the
encyclopedia
now
britannica
international

translated
from
the
original
edition
with
a
few
articles
modified
or
rewritten
is
published
by

of

publishing
house
the
and
of
the
all
volumes
are
index


print
version
since
the
britannica
has
had
four
parts
the
the
the
and
a
index


the
britannica
articles
are
found
in
the
and
which
contain
and
books
respectively
each
book
having
about
one
thousand
pages


the
has
detailed
articles
which
can
be
as
short
as
pages
and
as
long
as
pages
and
having
references
and
named
writers


the
has
about
articles
and
about
contain
less
than
words
no
references
and
no
named
contributors


the
articles
are
supposed
to
be
for
quick
and
to
help
in
finding
more
information
in
the


the
articles
are
supposed
to
be
articles
on
their
subjects
and
articles
of
information
where
you
can
not
find
anywhere
else


the
longest
article
pages
is
on
the
united
states
and
came
from
putting
the
articles
on
the
individual
states
together


information
can
be
found
in
the
britannica
by
following
the
notes
telling
where
people
can
find
more
information
in
the
and
but
there
are
very
little
of
this
with
about
only
one
of
this
every
page


so
readers
are
asked
to
try
to
use
the
indexes
or
the
which
organises
what
is
in
the
britannica
by
topic


the
use
of
the
is
its
outline
of
knowledge
which
wants
to
organise
all
of
everything
people
know


the
outline
is
thought
through
by
the
britannica
editors
to
decide
which
articles
should
be
included
in
the
and


the
outline
is
also
intended
to
be
a
study
guide
and
to
tell
a
student
who
wants
to
learn
a
topic
in
depth
what
articles
to
use


however
libraries
say
that
very
few
people
use
it
and
reviewers
recommend
the
encyclopedias
to
not
print
it
anymore


the
also
has
diagrams
printed
on
transparent
paper
of
big
topics
and
a
section
which
lists
the
people
working
together
to
make
the
encyclopedia


altogether
the
and
have
about
million
words
and
pictures


the
index
has
pages
which
lists
all
the
topics
written
about
in
the
britannica


the
britannica
uses
the
british
spellings
and
not
american
spellings


for
example
it
uses
color
not
color
center
not
center
and
encyclopedia
not
encyclopedia


however
this
rule
is
not
always
followed
for
example
defense
and
not
defense


the
other
spellings
of
the
word
is
sometimes
shown
with
a
link
for
example
color
see
colour


since
the
articles
of
the
britannica
have
been
revised
often
with
about
of
the
articles
brought
to
be
each
year


one
britannica
website
says
that
of
the
articles
were
revised
in
the
past
three
years
but
another
britannica
says
only
of
the
articles
were
revised


the
way
the
articles
are
arranged
in
alphabet
order
in
the
and
is
very
accurate


letters
are
ignored
and
articles
with
numbers
such
as
war
of
are
arranged
as
if
the
number
had
been
written
out
war
of


if
the
articles
have
the
same
names
articles
about
persons
go
first
then
by
places
then
by
things


people
with
the
same
names
are
arranged
first
alphabetically
by
country
and
then
by
their
time


similarly
places
that
have
the
same
names
are
arranged
by
alphabet
by
the
country
they
are

a
pipeline
is
a
long
tube
that
is
used
to
transport
liquids
or
gases
over
long
distances


pipelines
are
made
of
metal


while
the
transport
of
liquids
and
gases
is
common
some
pipelines
are
used
to
transport
coal
or
<collocation>iron ore</collocation>
which
are
mixed
with
mud


<collocation>such pipelines</collocation>
are
sometimes
called
slurry
pipelines


even
though
a
pipeline
is
very
expensive
to
build
it
often
is
a
more
economical
form
of
transport
that
the
transport
by
road


many
stadiums
use
a
central
tank
for
beer


each
bar
is
served
by
a
pipeline
from
the
central
tank


even
though
mail
and
other
goods
can
also
be
delivered
that
way
the
system
is
generally
not
referred
to
as
pipeline


in
this
case
capsules
are
used


these
are
propelled
by
air


<collocation>technology pipeline</collocation>
networks
are
made
of
different
components


these
are
the
supply
station
is
where
the
pipeline
starts


very
often
there
are
tanks
that
act
as
a
buffer
there
are
several
pumps
and
compressors
which
move
the
product
through
the
pipeline


partial
<collocation>delivery stations</collocation>
allow
to
deliver
part
of
the
product
<collocation>block valve</collocation>
stations
use
valves
to
isolate
the
pipeline
into
independent
segments


regulator
stations
are
used
to
release
some
of
the
pressure
the
final
delivery
station
is
where
the
product
is
delivered
to
the
consumer


very
often
tanks
are
used
as
a
buffer
