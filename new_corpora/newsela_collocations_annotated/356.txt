said
that
the
nazis
themselves
had
done
it
to
come
to
power


on
the
very
same
day
an
emergency
law
called
was
passed


the
government
claimed
it
was
to
protect
the
state
from
people
trying
to
hurt
the
country


with
this
law
most
of
the
civil
rights
of
the
republic
did
not
count
any
longer


this
was
used
by
the
nazis
against
the
other
political
parties


members
of
the
communist
and
parties
were
put
into
prison
or
killed


people
were
threatened
and
there
was
a
lot
of
violence
against
them


the
nazis
became
the
biggest
party
in
the
parliament


by
they
managed
to
make
all
other
parties
illegal


democracy
was
replaced
with
a
dictatorship

started


western

like
france
belgium
and
the

were
occupied
and
to

treated
by
germany
as
colonies
while
in
eastern
countries
such
as
poland
and
the
soviet
union
the
nazis
planned
to
enslave
the
slavic
peoples
so
that
german
settlers
could
take
their
land


the
nazis
made
alliances
with
other
european
countries
such
as
finland
and
italy


every
other
european
country
that
allied
with
germany
did
it
because
they
did
want
to
be
taken
over
by
germany

alliances
and

the
nazis
managed
to
control
much
of
europe

millions
of
these
people
at
the
concentration
camps
with
poison
gas


the
nazis
also
killed
millions
of
people
in
these
groups
by

labor
without
giving
them
much
food

armies
who
had
fought
right
across
germany
after
invading
nazi
europe
from
normandy
in
france
on

the
nazis
lost
because
the
allies
had
many
more
soldiers
and
more
money
than
them

the
invasion
of
berlin
hitler
may
have
shot
himself

trial
for
the
nazis
after
the
war
the
allied
governments
such
as
the
united
states
britain
and
soviet
union
held
trials
for
the
nazi
leaders


these
trials
were
held
in
in
germany


for
this
reason
these
trials
were
called
the
trials


the
allied
leaders
accused
the
nazi
leaders
of
murdering
millions
of
people
in
the
holocaust
of
starting
wars
of
conspiracy
and
belonging
to
illegal
organizations


most
nazi
leaders
were
found
guilty
by
the
court
and
they
were
sent
to
jail
or
executed
by
hanging


nazis
after
the
war
while
there
has
not
been
a
nazi
state
since
there
are
still
people
who
believe
in
those
ideas


these
people
called
neo
nazis
which
means
new
nazis
claim
that
northern
and
western
european
white
people
are
superior
to
all
other
races
of
people
tell
the
truth
about
the
jews
and
the
holocaust
and
tell
other
people
to
hate
jewish
people
and
other
groups
of
people
because
they
believe
that
jews
have
too
much
world
influence


a
few
people
and
some
former
german
soldiers
say
that
the
holocaust
killings
never
happened
or
that
fewer
people
were
killed
in
the
holocaust


people
with
these
ideas
are
called
holocaust
deniers


after
the
war
laws
were
made
in
germany
and
other
countries
especially
countries
in
europe


these
laws
say
it
is
forbidden
to
say
that
the
holocaust
never
really
happened


sometimes
they
also
ban
questioning
the
number
of
people
affected
by
it
which
is
saying
that
not
so
many
people
were
killed
as
most
people
think


there
has
been
some
controversy
over
this
as
affecting
people
free
speech


certain
countries
such
as
germany
austria
and
france
also
ban
the
use
of
nazi
symbols
to
stop
nazis
from
using
them

jehovah
witnesses
is
a
group
with
more
than
seven
million
members
throughout
the
world


they
believe
god
is
about
to
end
the
present
system
of
life
in
the
world
with
its
crime
violence
sickness
and
death
and
replace
it
with
his
kingdom
which
will
bring
about
peace
for
all
humans
who
live
by
bible
standards


most
of
the
religion
beliefs
are
based
on
the
bible
and
these
beliefs
were
taught
by
charles
russell
a
preacher
who
started
a
bible
study
group
in
pennsylvania
usa
in
and
later
started
publishing
a
religious
magazine
called
the
watchtower


many
of
those
beliefs
especially
about
who
god
is
and
what
his
plans
are
for
humans
and
the
earth
are
different
to
what
is
taught
in
mainstream
christian
churches


jehovah
witnesses
believe
that
only
people
will
go
to
heaven
and
that
the
remaining
people
who
obey
god
will
live
forever
on
a
paradise
earth


they
do
not
believe
that
god
is
a
trinity
and
teach
that
when
people
die
they
remain
in
their
grave
until
<collocation>jesus christ</collocation>
them
after
god
kingdom
or
government
is
ruling
over
earth


witnesses
are
best

for
preaching
their
beliefs
from

in

official
history
in
a
young
clothing
shop
owner
named
charles
russell
heard
an
adventist
preacher
explain
that
the
bible
contained
clues
that
showed
god
was
about
to
set
up
a
kingdom
or
government
over
earth


he
said
the
kingdom
which
is
mentioned
many
times
in
the
new
testament
of
the
bible
would
be
based
in
heaven
and
it
would
completely
change
the
way
of
life
for
everyone
in
the
world


russell
studied
that
preacher
teachings
then
changed
some
of
them
to
arrive
at
a
set
of
beliefs
of
his
own


using
a
combination
of
bible
verses
and
historical
dates
he
came
to
the
decision
that
god
would
very
soon
call
to
heaven
a
group
of
saints
who
would
become
the
kings
of
that
kingdom


there
would
also
be
other
saints
who
were
faithful
christians
of
the
past
who
had
since
died
who
would
also
make
up
a
total
of
kings
in
heaven


churches
at
the
time
were
teaching
that
humans
were
still
waiting
for
jesus
to
return
to
earth
in
his
second
coming
but
russell
believed
all
those
bible
clues
proved
jesus
had
actually
returned
in
for
what
he
called
his
or
presence


russell
believed
part
of
god
plan
was
also
to
start
armageddon
which
he
believed
would
be
a
complete
breakdown
of
law
and
order
on
earth
when
governments
and
classes
of
people
would
fight
among
themselves


but
after
that
he
believed
god
would
end
sickness
and
death
and
allow
humble
and
<collocation>obedient christians</collocation>
to
live
forever
in
perfect
health


russell
believed
it
was
very
important
that
all
christians
including
those
who
were
attending
churches
should
learn
those
truths
he
believed
had
been
carefully
hidden
in
the
bible
for
thousands
of
years


he
therefore
established
a
<collocation>publishing group</collocation>
called
the
watch
tower
bible
and
<collocation>tract society</collocation>
of
pennsylvania


he
wrote
several
books
set
up
some
bible
study
classes
where
people
could
study
his
teachings
and
began
publishing
a
magazine
zion
watch
tower
and
herald
of

which
announced
that
christ
was
already
present


he
wrote
about
his
belief
that
god
would
bring
about
all
those
events
by


by
the
time
russell
died
in
the
articles
books
pamphlets
and
sermons
he
had
written
totaled
printed
pages
with
almost
<collocation>million copies</collocation>
of
his
books
printed
and
distributed
around
the
world


his
position
as
president
of
the
watch
tower
society
was
taken
by
one
of
his
followers
joseph
franklin
rutherford


rutherford
began
writing
and
publishing
many
books
as
well


he
made
some
changes
to
russell
teachings
and
also
required
all
the
study
groups
or
congregations
around
the
world
to
agree
to
a
united
set
of
teachings
and
rules
issued
by
the
watch
tower
society
in
<collocation>new york</collocation>


he
told
all
members
of
the
religion
that
they
should
start
to
go
door
to
door
preaching
about
god
kingdom
and
also
sell
watch
tower
society
publications
so
more
people
would
hear
the
message


in
rutherford
introduced
the
name
jehovah
witnesses
for
the
religion
partly
to
highlight
what
the
religion
believed
was
god
holy
name


by
the
time
rutherford
died
in
the
religion
had
a
worldwide
membership
of


some
of
the
new
teachings
however
resulted
in
suffering
for
many
jehovah
witnesses


thousands
were
sent
to
prison
or
beaten
or
killed
in
several
countries
during
<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii
because
they
refused
to
fight
and
later
in
the
united
states
many
children
were
expelled
from
schools
because
they
refused
to
salute
the
flag
because
they
thought
that
was
something
that
god
would
not
approve


some
countries
still
have
laws
against
members
practising
that
religion


but
jehovah
witnesses
continued
to
grow
rapidly
partly
because
they
were
becoming
more
skilled
at
teaching
the
public
in
their
preaching
and
by
they
had
more
than
two
million
members
around
the
world
and
many
properties
at
their
<collocation>new york</collocation>
headquarters


from
the
religion
encouraged
members
to
believe
that
god
would
bring
armageddon
in
and
that
the
kingdom
would
be
set
up
very
soon
after


some
witnesses
sold
businesses
and
homes
gave
up
jobs
delayed
medical
operations
and
decided
against
starting
a
family
because
they
expected
armageddon
to
arrive


the
religion
leaders
later
apologised
for
those
statements
which
they
said
were
made
because
they
were
so
keen
for
the
kingdom
to
come


many
members
left
at
the
time
because
they
were
<collocation>disappointed nothing</collocation>
had
happened
but
membership
later
climbed
even
higher


what
they
believe
like
jews
muslims
and
christians
jehovah
witnesses
believe
there
is
a
god
who
is
the
creator
and
the
most
powerful
individual
in
the
universe


but
they
have
some
different
beliefs
from
those
religions


they
say
god
explained
in
the
bible
that
his
name
is
jehovah
which
is
a
translation
of
the
hebrew
letters
and
they
believe
it
is
important
that
people
know
that
name


they
believe
that
<collocation>jesus christ</collocation>
is
god
son
and
the
holy
spirit
is
the
power
that
god
can
use
or
let
other
people
use
to
help
his
purposes


they
do
not
believe
in
the
trinity


they
believe
the
bible
is
a
book
that
god
wrote
with
the
help
of
humans
and
it
is
therefore
completely
true
and
the
best
guide
to
how
people
should
live


jehovah
witnesses
believe
that
god
made
adam
and
eve
the
first
humans
and
put
them
in
a
paradise
called
eden


they
think
that
when
adam
and
eve
sinned
god
removed
his
special
protection
and
that
therefore
they
began
to
get
sick
and
die


because
they
were
no
longer
perfect
they
were
unable
to
have
perfect
children
so
from
that
point
humans
would
find
it
very
hard
to
avoid
sinning


they
believe
that
jehovah
later
sent
jesus
to
die
to
make
a
way
for
humans
to
get
back
the
paradise
that
adam
and
eve
lost
and
restore
them
to
perfect
health
and
life


jehovah
witnesses
believe
that
only
people
who
are
referred
to
in
revelation
chapters
and
will
go
to
heaven
to
be
kings
and
priests
with
<collocation>jesus christ</collocation>


they
say
that
god
is
going
to
use
his
powers
perhaps
involving
storms
or
earthquakes
to
start
a
worldwide
war
called
armageddon
and
that
billions
of
people
who
do
not
obey
god
or
worship
him
the
way
he
expects
will
be
killed


the
people
who
he
approves
will
survive
that
great
war
and
will
be
given
the
opportunity
to
live
forever
because
god
will
remove
all
sickness
disease
and
death


god
will
then
begin
to
turn
earth
into
a
<collocation>peaceful paradise</collocation>
where
there
will
be
no
crime
violence
or
wars
because
criminals
and
dishonest
people
will
have
died
at
armageddon


he
will
also
resurrect
bring
back
to
life
the
billions
of
people
who
died
in
the
past
so
they
can
learn
the
truth
about
god
and
show
they
want
to
live
obediently
in
a
paradise
as
well


jehovah
witnesses
believe
that
only
their
religion
truly
<collocation>obeys god</collocation>
instructions
and
that
god
disapproves
of
all
other
religions
including
catholics
protestants
buddhists
and
muslims
because
they
refuse
to
really
follow
the
bible


they
believe
the
leader
of
all
those
religions
is
satan
the
devil
who
tries
to
trick
people
into
thinking
they
are
pleasing
god
with
their
worship


for
that
reason
they
believe
only
baptised
members
of
jehovah
witnesses
will
be
saved
at
armageddon
though
god
will
make
the
final
choice


what
they
do
jehovah
witnesses
are
best
known
for
their
ministry
work


they
believe
<collocation>jesus christ</collocation>
ordered
them
at
matthew
to
go
make
disciples
of
all
the
nations
warning
people
that
the
day
of
god
judgement
or
armageddon
will
happen
soon


jehovah
witnesses
believe
their
preaching
work
is
a
fulfillment
of
prophesy
located
at
matthew
and
this
gospel
of
the
kingdom
will
be
preached
in
the
whole
world
as
a
testimony
to
all
nations
and
then
the
end
will
come


all
witnesses
are
expected
to
spend
time
regularly
in
public
preaching
work
which
usually
involves
offering
the
watchtower
other
watch
tower
society
publications


since
the
internet
jehovah
witnesses
also
preach
online
with
some
<collocation>bible studies</collocation>
taking
place
over
communication
networks
such
as


they
teach
people
witness
doctrine
about
jehovah
and
his
plans
for
the
earth
and
are
required
to
give
a
monthly
written
report
on
how
much
time
they
have
spent
in
that
ministry


the
buildings
where
jehovah
witnesses
meet
to
worship
are
called
kingdom
halls


unlike
many
other
churches
these
halls
do
not
have
altars
statues
symbols
such
as
the
cross
or
candles


each
congregation
has
two
meetings
a
week
which
are
broken
down
into
four
meeting
events
the
service
or
ministry
meeting
the
ministry
school
both
held
on
the
same
night
and
then
the
watchtower
study
and
a
public
talk
both
held
on
the
same
day


members
are
expected
to
attend
them
both
as
well
as
big
conventions
and
assemblies
several
times
a
year
some
of
them
at
hired
<collocation>sports arenas</collocation>
where
often
thousands
of
jehovah
witnesses
gather


most
meetings
consist
of
talks
or
study
sessions
based
on
articles
in
watch
tower
society
books
and
magazines
about
the
bible
or
christian
life


at
the
<collocation>congregation meetings</collocation>
members
of
the
audience
including
children
are
often
invited
to
make
comments
and
respond
to
questions
asked
by
the
speaker


the
religion
has
elders
and
ministerial
servants
who
are
called
bishops
and
deacons
in
some
other
christian
churches
but
they
have
no
paid
clergy
and
most
elders
support
themselves
by
having
other
jobs


also
they
do
not
consider
themselves
to
be
superior
to
other
members
of
the
congregation
and
do
not
set
themselves
apart
in
any
way
such
as
dressing
in
a
certain
way


members
of
the
religion
are
expected
to
live
up
to
high
moral
standards
and
told
they
should
always
be
honest


they
are
not
allowed
to
have
sex
with
people
they
are
not
married
to
and
homosexual
activity
is
also
banned


they
are
encouraged
to
marry
only
other
baptised
jehovah
witnesses
and
they
are
warned
that
god
does
not
like
married
couples
to
divorce


they
are
not
allowed
to
smoke
tobacco
or
take
illegal
drugs
but
are
allowed
to
drink
alcohol
if
they
do
not
get
drunk


they
do
not
vote
in
elections
salute
flags
sing
national
anthems
join
armies
or
fight
in
wars
and
they
also
do
not
celebrate
birthdays
christmas
easter
and
other
common
religious
holidays


they
also
refuse
to
have
<collocation>blood transfusions</collocation>
because
they
believe
that
in
the
bible
god
said
blood
should
not
be
taken
into
the
body


they
are
warned
not
to
make
close
friends
with
people
who
are
not
jehovah
witnesses
because
of
the
danger
that
those
people
could
make
their
faith
in
god
weaker
however
association
is
not
banned
in
places
were
it
not
possible
to
have
no
contact
such
as
places
of
work
as
this
is
considered
extreme
and
unnecessary


jehovah
witnesses
are
quite
strict
about
who
can
be
a
member


any
jehovah
witness
who
is
suspected
of
breaking
any
of
the
rules
of
the
religion
including
the
bible
moral
standards
may
be
asked
to
appear
before
an
investigation
held
by
elders
but
this
is
not
public
and
handled
discreetly


a
member
of
the
religion
who
disagrees
with
any
official
teaching
and
talks
or
writes
about
it
may
also
be
called
to
appear
and
answer
questions


that
investigation
is
called
a
<collocation>judicial committee</collocation>
and
if
the
elders
decide
the
person
is
guilty
and
does
not
regret
what
they
did
they
may
tell
the
person
they
have
been
which
means
they
are
no
longer
a
member
of
the
religion
or
approved
by
god


when
that
happens
no
other
jehovah
witness
is
allowed
to
talk
to
that
person
until
they
are
allowed
back
in


that
system
of
punishing
members
has
been
criticised
by
some
people
including
former
jehovah
witnesses
as
harsh
and
unfair


the
style
of
leadership
of
the
religion
has
also
been
described
by
some
authors
as
autocratic
and
totalitarian
because
of
the
way
members
have
to
be
completely
obedient
to
the
leaders
avoiding
any
criticism
of
the
religion
or
its
teachings
