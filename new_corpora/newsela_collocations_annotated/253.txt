life
<collocation>abraham lincoln</collocation>
was
born
on
february
in
kentucky


his
parents
were
thomas
lincoln
a
farmer
and
nancy
hanks


his
family
was
very
poor


abraham
had
one
brother
and
one
sister


his
brother
died
in
childhood


they
grew
up
in
a
small
log
cabin
house
with
just
one
room
inside


although
slavery
was
legal
in
kentucky
at
that
time
lincoln
father
who
was
a
religious
baptist
refused
to
own
any
slaves


when
lincoln
was
seven
years
old
his
family
moved
to
indiana
and
later
to
illinois


in
his
childhood
he
helped
his
father
on
the
farm
but
when
he
was
years
old
he
left
home
and
moved
to
new
salem
illinois
where
he
worked
in
a
general
store


later
he
said
that
he
had
gone
to
school
for
just
one
year
but
that
was
enough
to
learn
how
to
read
write
and
do
simple
math


in
he
married
mary
lincoln


they
had
four
children
but
three
of
them
died
when
they
were
very
young


<collocation>abraham lincoln</collocation>
was
sometimes
called
lincoln
or
honest
after
he
ran
miles
to
give
a
customer
the
right
amount
of
change


the
nickname
honest
came
from
a
time
when
he
started
a
business
that
failed


instead
of
running
away
like
many
people
would
have
he
stayed
and
worked
to
pay
off
his
debt


he
has
also
been
called
the
great
emancipator
because
of
his
work
to
end
slavery
in
the
united
states


in
he
declared
that
all
slaves
held
in
the
rebellious
confederate
states
were
free


he
also
sponsored
the
thirteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution


ratified
in
nine
months
after
his
assassination
that
amendment
completely
outlawed
slavery
in
the
united
states


early
political
career
lincoln
started
his
political
career
in
when
he
ran
for
the
illinois
general
assembly
but
he
lost
the
election


he
served
as
a
captain
in
the
army
during
the
<collocation>black hawk</collocation>
war
a
war
with
native
american
tribes


when
he
moved
to
springfield
in
he
began
to
work
as
a
lawyer


soon
he
became
one
of
the
most
highly
respected
lawyers
in
illinois


in
as
a
member
of
the
illinois
general
assembly
lincoln
issued
a
written
protest
of
its
passage
of
a
resolution
stating
that
slavery
could
not
be
abolished
in
washington
in
he
won
a
court
case
bailey
cromwell
representing
a
black
woman
who
claimed
she
had
already
been
freed
and
could
not
be
sold
as
a
slave


in
he
lost
a
case
rutherford
representing
a
slave
owner
robert
claiming
return
of
<collocation>fugitive slaves</collocation>


in
lincoln
joined
the
whig
party
and
was
elected
to
one
term
in
the
house
of
representatives


after
that
he
ignored
his
political
career
and
instead
became
a
very
good
railroad
lawyer


in
in
reaction
to
the
passage
of
the
act
lincoln
became
involved
in
politics
again


he
joined
the
republican
party
which
had
recently
been
formed
in
opposition
to
the
expansion
of
slavery


in
he
wanted
to
become
senator
although
this
was
unsuccessful
the
debates
drew
national
attention
to
him


the
republican
party
nominated
him
for
the
<collocation>presidential election</collocation>
of


presidency
a
sketch
of
candidate
<collocation>abraham lincoln</collocation>
the
first
photographic
image
of
the
new
president
lincoln
was
chosen
as
a
candidate
for
the
elections
in
for
different
reasons


among
these
reasons
were
that
his
views
on
slavery
were
less
extreme
than
those
of
other
people
who
wanted
to
be
candidates


lincoln
was
from
what
was
then
one
of
the
western
states
and
had
a
bigger
chance
of
winning
the
election
there


other
candidates
that
were
older
or
more
experienced
than
him
had
enemies
inside
the
party


lincoln
family
was
poor
which
added
to
the
republican
position
of
free
labor
the
opposite
of
slave
labor


lincoln
won
the
election
in
and
was
made
the
president
of
the
united
states


he
won
with
almost
no
votes
in
the
south


for
the
first
time
a
president
had
won
the
election
because
of
the
large
support
he
got
from
the
states
in
the
north


during
his
presidency
lincoln
became
because
of
his
large
stovepipe
hat


he
used
his
tall
hat
to
store
papers
and
documents
when
he
was
traveling


lincoln
and
the
civil
war
after
lincoln
election
seven
states
south
carolina
mississippi
alabama
florida
georgia
texas
and
louisiana
formed
the
confederate
states
of
america


when
the
united
states
refused
to
surrender
fort
in
south
carolina
the
confederates
attacked
the
fort
beginning
the
american
civil
war


later
four
more
states
arkansas
virginia
tennessee
and
north
carolina
joined
the
confederacy
for
a
total
of
eleven


in
his
whole
period
as
president
he
had
to
rebuild
the
union
with
military
force
and
many
<collocation>bloody battles</collocation>


he
also
had
to
stop
the
border
states
like
kentucky
missouri
and
maryland
from
leaving
the
union
and
joining
the
confederacy


lincoln
was
not
a
general
and
had
only
been
in
the
army
for
a
short
time
during
the
<collocation>black hawk</collocation>
war


however
he
still
took
a
major
role
in
the
war
often
spending
days
and
days
in
the
war
department


his
plan
was
to
cut
off
the
south
by
surrounding
it
with
ships
control
the
mississippi
river
and
take
richmond
the
confederate
capital


he
often
clashed
with
generals
in
the
field
especially
george
and
fired
generals
who
lost
battles
or
were
not
aggressive
enough


eventually
he
made
ulysses
grant
the
top
general
in
the
army


emancipation
proclamation
with
the
emancipation
proclamation
on
january
lincoln
ordered
the
freedom
of
all
slaves
in
those
states
still
in
rebellion
during
the
american
civil
war


it
did
not
actually
immediately
free
all
those
slaves
however
since
those
areas
were
still
controlled
by
the
rebelling
states
of
the
confederacy


only
a
small
number
of
slaves
already
behind
union
lines
were
immediately
freed


as
the
union
army
advanced
nearly
all
four
million
slaves
were
effectively
freed


some
former
slaves
joined
the
union
army


the
proclamation
also
did
not
free
slaves
in
the
slave
states
that
had
remained
loyal
to
the
union
the
federal
government
of
the
us


neither
did
it
apply
to
areas
where
union
forces
had
already
regained
control


until
the
thirteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
in
only
the
states
had
power
to
end
slavery
within
their
own
borders
so
lincoln
issued
the
proclamation
as
a
war
measure


the
proclamation
made
freeing
the
slaves
a
union
goal
for
the
war
and
put
an
end
to
movements
in
european
nations
especially
in
great
britain
and
france
that
would
have
recognized
the
confederacy
as
an
independent
nation


lincoln
then
sponsored
a
<collocation>constitutional amendment</collocation>
to
free
all
slaves


the
thirteenth
amendment
making
slavery
illegal
everywhere
in
the
united
states
was
passed
late
in
eight
months
after
lincoln
was
assassinated

and
many
