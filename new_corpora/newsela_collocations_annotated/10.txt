animals
can
mainly
be
divided
into
two
main
groups
the
invertebrates

the

are
animals
with

is
adapted
to
a

acceleration
is
a
measure
of
how
fast
velocity
changes


acceleration
is
the
change
of
velocity
divided
by
the

acceleration
is
a
vector
and

includes
both
a

is
the

down
the
main
laws

according
to
newton
second
law

the
force
something
needs
to
accelerate
an
object
depends
on
the
object
mass
the
amount
of
stuff
the
object
is
made
from
or
how
heavy
it
is


the
formula
of
newton

law
of
motion
is
f
m
a
where
a
is
the
acceleration
f
is
the
force
and
m
the

one
of
the

deceleration
deceleration
is
the
opposite
of

this
means
that
something
slows
down
instead
of
speeding
up


for

brakes
it
is
decelerating

so
that

goodwill
by
