want
and
ignorance
two
poor
children
in
dickens
novel
a
want
is
a
wish
or
a
desire
for
something


if
a
person
would
like
to
have
something
but
can
choose
not
to
have
it
that
thing
is
wanted
or
can
be
called
a
want


to
want
is
not
the
same
as
to
need
which
is
when
someone
must
have
something


people
often
talk
about
needing
a
thing
when
they
really
just
want
it


wants
can
be
for
the
same
things
as
needs


for
example
a
person
can
need
to
eat
food
and
can
want
to
eat
cake


if
there
is
no
cake
then
he
or
she
may
have
to
eat
something
else
perhaps
bread


the
need
is
no
longer
so
important
the
person
is
no
longer
hungry
although
the
want
may
still
be
there


if
there
is
cake
then
the
person
needs
and
wants
can
both
be
met


in
economics
a
want
is
about
goods
or
services


choice
is
how
to
satisfy
or
meet
a
want
when
there
are
different
ways
to
do
this


want
can
also
be
the
idea
of
what
it
means
to
be
poor
hungry
or
with
no
money


charles

languages
you

a
german
soldier
named
von
wrote
in
his
classic
book
on
war
der
ist
der
mit
war
is
just
politics
by
other
means
and
war
is
a
way
of
using
force
to
get
our
enemies
to
do
what
we
want
them
to
do


wars
have
been
fought
to
control
natural
resources
for
religious
or
cultural
reasons
over
political
balances
of
power
legitimacy
correctness
of
particular
laws
to
settle
arguments
about
land
or
money
and
many
other
issues


the
reasons
of
any
war
are
very
complex
while
a
war
can
start
for
just
about
any
reason
there
is
usually
more
than
one
cause

kinds
of
war
sometimes
people
do
see
a
difference
between
fighting
between
countries
or
people
and
the
formal
declaration
of
a
state
of
war


those
who
do
see
this
difference
usually
only
use
the
word
war
for
the
fighting
where
the
countries
governments
have
officially
declared
war
on
each
other


smaller
armed
conflicts
are
often
called
riots
rebellions
coups


when
one
country
sends
armed
forces
to
another
country
supposedly
to
help
keep
order
or
prevent
killings
of
innocents
or
other
crimes
against
humanity
or
to
protect
another
government
friendly
to
it
against
an
uprising
that
country
sometimes
calls
it
a
police
action
instead
of
a
war


some
people
disagree
with
the
use
of
this
word


a
war
between
peoples
and
groups
in
the
same
country
is
known
as
a
civil
war


some
people
say
peace
is
the
absence
of
war


another
way
to
classify
warfare
splits
it
into
four
generations
of
war


first
<collocation>generation warfare</collocation>
first
<collocation>generation warfare</collocation>
reflects
tactics
of
the
era
of
the
smoothbore
musket
the
tactics
of
line
and
column


operational
art
in
the
first
generation
did
not
exist
as
an
idea
although
it
was
practiced


second
<collocation>generation warfare</collocation>
second
<collocation>generation warfare</collocation>
was
developed
in
response
to
the
rifled
musket
barbed
wire
the
and
indirect
fire
artillery


tactics
were
based
on
one
group
firing
and
another
moving
but
they
remained
linear
with
the
defense
still
trying
to
prevent
all
penetrations
and
the
attacks
along
a
sideways
line
advanced
by
rushes
in
small
groups


second
generation
tactics
remained
the
basic
tactics
of
the
until
the
and
they
are
still
practiced
by
most
american
units
in
the
field


third
<collocation>generation warfare</collocation>
third
<collocation>generation warfare</collocation>
was
first
developed
by
the
germans
in
<collocation>world war</collocation>
i
to
make
up
for
their
inability
to
match
their
enemies
industrial
production


its
tactics
were
the
first
truly
nonlinear
tactics
attacks
rely
on
penetration
to
get
around
and
collapse
the
enemy
combat
forces
rather
than
seeking
to
get
close
to
the
enemy
and
destroy
them
and
defense
was
in
depth
and
often
provoked
invited
or
encouraged
penetration
to
set
the
enemy
up
for
a
counterattack


fourth
<collocation>generation warfare</collocation>
fourth
<collocation>generation warfare</collocation>
is
what
most
people
call
a
guerrilla
war


fourth
<collocation>generation warfare</collocation>
is
far
different
from
the
other
generations
as
the
objective
is
not
winning
a
military
victory
but
rather
to
destroy
the
spirit
or
political
means
of
the
enemy
from
attacking
you


usually
it
is
when
a
country
is
brought
into
another
one
or
when
an
outside
force
is
trying
to
destroy
the
current
government


for
example
the
later
part
of
the
second
iraq
war
or
the
occupation
period
can
be
considered
fourth
<collocation>generation warfare</collocation>


laws
of
war
a
number
of
treaties
and
other
agreements
control
warfare


put
together
these
are
called
the
laws
of
war


the
most
common
and
famous
of
those
are
the
<collocation>geneva conventions</collocation>
the
earliest
of
which
began
to
take
effect
in
the
mid


treaty
signing
has
been
a
part
of
international
diplomacy
and
too
many
treaties
to
mention
in
this
article
have
been
signed


a
couple
of
examples
are
resolutions
of
the
geneva
international
conference

treatment

school
year
can

there
are
several
ways
used
to
measure
the
length
of
a
year


a
solar
year
is
based

the
gregorian
calendar
is

the
solar
year


the

days
hours
minutes
each
or
days
long


a

is
the
time
between
two
vernal
the
first

between
the
times
when
the

an
eclipse
year
is

this
is
when
the

through
a
part
of
the
sky
where
it
is
possible
for
the
sun
earth
and
moon
to
be
in
a
line


it
is
also
when
<collocation>solar eclipses</collocation>
can
happen


solar
and
lunar
years
are
used
by
different
societies
in
daily
life


the
other
measurements
are
used
by
astronomers


there
was
no
year
numbered
year
zero
in
a

system
of

because
it
would

there
is
a

which
was
the
year
ad
one
in
the
anno
domini
system
also
called
ce
in
the
common
era
used
with
our
gregorian
calendar


however
some
astronomers
call
the
year
or

to
make
it
easier
for
them
to
count
leap
years
before
that
year

chinese
speaking
settlements
the
chinese
language
is
the
language
used
by
chinese
in
china
and
elsewhere


it
forms
one
of
the
groups
of
a
language
family
called
the
family
of
languages


chinese
is
the
most
spoken
language
in
the
world


chinese
can
refer
to
the
written
or
the
spoken
languages


chinese
is
special
because
although
there
are
many
spoken
languages
they
use
only
one
way
of
writing
the
language


therefore
it
is
possible
to
communicate
by
writing
the
same
way


many
people
in
china
think
that
although
these
different
languages
sound
different
they
are
still
one
language


they
call
these
different
languages
fang
yan
to
tell
them
apart
from
one
another


fang
means
part
of
the
country
and
yan
means
speech
so
literally
it
means
the
speech
of
one
part
of
the
country


they
have
one
standard
language
for
all
of
the
schools
in
china
and
taiwan


it
is
also
a
standard
for
language
teaching
in
some
other
countries


in
english
we
call
it
mandarin


in
china
they
call
it
pu
tong
or
common
to
everybody
speech


in
taiwan
they
call
it
or
language
of
the
whole
country


they
need
a
standard
language
because
otherwise
even
though
they
are
in
the
same
country
many
people
could
not
understand
each
other


the
chinese
language
is
like
a
big
tree


the
base
of
the
tree
started
thousands
of
<collocation>years ago</collocation>


it
now
has
several
main
limbs


some
people
call
just
a
branch
what
other
people
call
a
main
limb
so
you
can
say
there
are
six
or
seven
main
limbs


each
of
these
main
limbs
splits
off
into
branches
about
the
way
there
are
branches
of
english
spoken
in
great
britain
the
united
states
australia
india
and
so
forth


line
the
chinese
limbs
up
by
number
of
speakers
and
we
get
mandarin
the
language
spoken
in
an
area
centering
on
shanghai
the
language
spoken
in
province
cantonese
the
language
spoken
mostly
in
province
but
also
by
many
speakers
in
taiwan
the
language
spoken
mostly
in
province
a
language
that
is
historically
that
of
a
refugee
group
and
so
not
so
closely
concentrated
in
any
one
area
in
china
it
is
called
or
guest
family
speech
and
a
language
spoken
in
an
area
that
centers
on
province


just
as
the
romance
languages
all
come
from
the
area
around
rome
and
are
based
on
latin
the
chinese
languages
all
have
some
common
source
so
they
keep
many
common
things
among
them


chinese
is
used
by
the
han
people
in
china
and
other
groups
who
have
come
into
china
and
think
of
themselves
as
chinese


chinese
is
almost
always
written
in
chinese
characters


they
are
symbols
that
have
meaning
called


they
also
give
some
indication
of
pronunciation


but
just
as
sounds
very
different
in
english
french
and
spanish
the
same
character
can
get
very
different
pronunciations
among
the
seven
main
limbs
of
chinese
or
even
sometimes
from
branch
to
branch


since
chinese
characters
have
been
around
for
at
least
years
it
is
no
wonder
that
people
in
places
far
from
each
other
would
say
them
differently
just
as
can
be
read
differently
in
different
languages


chinese
people
needed
to
write
down
pronunciations
in
dictionaries


chinese
does
not
have
an
alphabet
so
how
to
write
down
sounds
was
a
big
problem
in
the
beginning


nowadays
the
mandarin
language
uses
to
represent
the
sounds
in
roman
letters


all
the
chinese
languages
or
dialects
uses
tones


this
means
that
they
use
high
and
low
pitches
to
help
make
differences
in
meaning
clear


chinese
does
not
have
very
many
syllables


for
instance
the
words
for
mother
hemp
horse
scold
and
a
kind
of
word
put
at
the
end
of
sentences
to
make
them
into
questions
are
all
pronounced
ma
in
mandarin


so
for
mother
you
say
ma
high
and
level


for
hemp
you
say
ma
starting
low
and
ending
high


for
horse
you
say
ma
starting
fairly
high
dipping
very
low
and
then
going
back
up
again


for
scold
you
say
ma
starting
high
and
ending
low


then
to
make
a
question
out
of
a
statement
you
add
ma
but
you
keep
it
very
soft
and
short
and
about
on
the
same
level


mandarin
has
first
tone
second
tone
third
tone
fourth
tone
and
neutral
tone


other
chinese
languages
have
more
tones
some
as
many
as
nine

in
the
government
of
the
people
republic
of
china
made
public
a
set
of
simplified
chinese
characters
to
make
learning
reading
and
writing
the
chinese
language
easier


in
mainland
china
and
singapore
people
use
these
simpler
characters


in
<collocation>hong kong</collocation>
taiwan
and
other
places
where
they
speak
chinese
people
still
use
the
more
<collocation>traditional characters</collocation>


the
korean
language
also
uses
chinese
characters
to
represent
certain
words


the
japanese
language
uses
them
even
more
often


these
characters
are
known
in
korean
as
and
in
japanese
as
kanji


a
chinese
person
with
a
good
education
today
knows
characters


about
chinese
characters
are
needed
to
read
a
mainland
newspaper


however
people
who
have
learned
only
the
most
frequently
used
characters
can
read
a
newspaper
but
they
will
have
to
guess
some
words


examples
here
are
some
samples
of
some
words
and
sentences
in
mandarin
chinese


simplified
characters
are
on
the
left
and
<collocation>traditional characters</collocation>
are
on
the
right


the
pronunciation
is
given
in
the
system
which
may
not
always
be
as
simple
as
it
looks
for
those
who
have
not
studied
it


the
<collocation>traditional characters</collocation>
are
now
used
in
<collocation>hong kong</collocation>
and
taiwan


chinese
from
mainland
china
uses
the
simplified
characters
but
may
recognize
<collocation>traditional characters</collocation>


before
chinese
was
written
using
only
<collocation>traditional characters</collocation>


at
that
time
most
chinese
people
could
not
read
or
write
at
all


the
government
of
the
people
republic
of
china
thought
that
the
<collocation>traditional characters</collocation>
were
very
hard
to
understand
