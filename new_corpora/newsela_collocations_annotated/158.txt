history
although
crude
chemical
warfare
has
been
employed
in
many
parts
of
the
world
for
thousands
of
years
modern
chemical
warfare
began
during
<collocation>world war</collocation>
i
see
<collocation>chemical weapons</collocation>
in
<collocation>world war</collocation>
i


initially
only
commercially
available
chemicals
and
their
variants
were
used


these
included
chlorine
and
phosgene
gas


the
methods
used
to
disperse
these
agents
during
battle
were
relatively
unrefined
and
inefficient


even
so
casualties
could
be
heavy
due
to
the
mainly
<collocation>static troop</collocation>
positions
which
were
characteristic
features
of
<collocation>trench warfare</collocation>


germany
the
first
side
to
employ
chemical
warfare
on
the
battlefield
simply
opened
canisters
of
chlorine
upwind
of
the
opposing
side
and
let
the
prevailing
winds
do
the
dissemination


soon
after
the
french
modified
artillery
munitions
to
contain
phosgene
a
much
more
effective
method
that
became
the
principal
means
of
delivery


since
the
development
of
modern
chemical
warfare
in
<collocation>world war</collocation>
i
nations
have
pursued
research
and
development
on
<collocation>chemical weapons</collocation>
that
falls
into
four
major
categories
new
and
more
deadly
agents
more
efficient
methods
of
delivering
agents
to
the
target
dissemination
more
reliable
means
of
defense
against
<collocation>chemical weapons</collocation>
and
more
sensitive
and
accurate
means
of
detecting
chemical
agents


germany
was
the
first
to
produce
chemical
agents


use
in
antiquity
the
first
form
of
chemical
warfare
was
in
the
form
of
poisoned
arrows
and
during
the
stone
age


these
were
dipped
in
poison
like
that
from
snakes
or
scorpions


sometimes
poisonous
plants
were
used


the
ancient
chinese
used
various
forms
of
poisonous
smokes
when
they
besieged
a
city


ancient
greeks
used
a
form
of
burning
wood
pitch
and
sulphur


<collocation>world war</collocation>
one
poison
gas
was
first
used
in
<collocation>world war</collocation>
one


france
was
the
first
country
to
make
this
type
of
gas


however
germany
was
the
first
to
use
it
in
battle
on
march
when
they
used
tear
gas
against
france


it
was
included
in
some
of
the
new
deadly
weapons
of
<collocation>world war</collocation>
one


the
three
types
of
gas
used
in
<collocation>world war</collocation>
one
were
chlorine
gas
tear
gas
phosgene
gas
and
<collocation>mustard gas</collocation>


tear
gas
made
a
person
cough
and
go
blind
very
fast


phosgene
caused
a
person
to
cough
and
choke
much
worse
than
tear
gas


<collocation>mustard gas</collocation>
was
the
worst
gas
because
it
almost
impossible
to
protect
against


it
caused
sores
on
the
outside
and
inside
of
the
body


modern
use
they
were
not
used
very
much
in
<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii
apart
by
the
japanese
army
during
the
invasion
of
china


this
was
because
everybody
was
afraid
that
the
other
side
would
use
weapons
like
theirs


also
<collocation>chemical weapons</collocation>
were
not
easy
to
use


the
time
taken
to
use
them
slowed
the
advance
of
one
own
troops


the
raw
materials
for
producing
<collocation>chemical weapons</collocation>
were
not
easy
to
get


this
was
because
<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii
was
fought
in
areas
which
were
not
connected
well
by
railroads


during
the
war
iraq
used
<collocation>chemical weapons</collocation>
but
not
iran


many
people
believe
that
iraq
used
<collocation>chemical weapons</collocation>
against
kurdish
people


according
to
international
law
it
is
wrong
to
use
<collocation>chemical weapons</collocation>


there
are
many
rules
that
ban
the
production
import
and
use
of
<collocation>chemical weapons</collocation>


of
these
the
most
important
is
the
<collocation>chemical weapons</collocation>
convention


united

has
been
an
active
user
of
<collocation>chemical weapons</collocation>
like

even
after

the
president
of

<collocation>ronald reagan</collocation>
called
for
a
worldwide
ban
on
<collocation>chemical weapons</collocation>


after
this
negotiations
between
various
countries
started


the
<collocation>chemical weapons</collocation>
convention
was
signed
in
and
came
into
effect

history
of

in
the
past
iran
was
called
persia
by
people
outside
of
the
country


the
people
that
lived
there
called
the
country
iran


the
official
name
was
persia


this
meant
that
the
name
persia
was
used
when
dealing
with
other
countries
and
in
government
papers


in
then
of
iran
officially
renamed
the
country
iran


this
was
done
to
show
that
iran
belongs
to
all
the
iranians
as
well
as
to
persian
iranians


the
name
iran
means
the
land
of
aryans


it
is
used
in
the
ancient
book
of
the
the


in
the
and
early
century
the
name
aryan
was
used
by
europeans
to
mean
all


the
<collocation>aryan race</collocation>
was
a
term
that
hitler
used
to
describe
his
superior
or
perfect
race
but
it
first
meant
iranians


persian
empire
around
iran
was
the
center
of
the
empire


the
greek
city
states
fought
against
the
persian
armies
led
by
the
great
and


then
alexander
the
great
took
the
country
by
fighting
the
dynasty
of
persia
and
then
later
ruled


after
them
the
dynasty
took
over


other
people
took
persia
by
fighting
like
the
arabs
century
turks
century
and
mongols
century


however
iran
has
always
had
a
different
culture
and
continued
to
survive


new
iran
further
islamic
revolution
the
cia
worked
in
iran
to
create
riots
which
led
to
the
removal
of
<collocation>prime minister</collocation>


the
united
states
and
great
britain
then
made
the
shah
king
of
iran
again


when
the
shah
left
iran
he
had
ruled
for
less
than
a
year


the
iranian
government
was
changed
to
an
islamic
republic
by
islamic
revolution


soon
afterwards
the
iranian
students
movement
with
the
backing
of
the
new
government
took
over
the
embassy
in


they
held
most
of
the
<collocation>diplomats hostage</collocation>
for
days


relations
between
the
two
countries
have
not
been
good
since


for
example
the
us
claims
that
iran
supports
terrorist
groups
against
israel


iran
does
not
see
israel
as
a
country


iran
along
with
most
arab
countries
believes
that
israel
does
not
have
the
right
to
occupy
the
land
of
palestinians


iranians
are
ethnically
not
arabs


iran
defended
itself
against
iraqi
invasion
in
a
war
that
lasted
eight
years


many
arab
and
western
countries
including
the
united
states
provided
weapons
including
biological
and
<collocation>chemical weapons</collocation>
of
mass
destruction
and
technical
support
for
iraq


now
the
west
is
trying
to
prevent
iran
from
using
nuclear
technology
even
though
iran
is
a
member
of
the


the
international
<collocation>atomic energy</collocation>
agency
has
reported
many
times
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
iran
is
developing
nuclear
weapons


however
it
also
says
that
it
can
not
say
for
sure
that
iran
is
not
doing
so
in
secret


a
december
cia
report
on
nuclear
activity
in
iran
that
iran
secret
program
to

his
early
years
was
born
in
the
kingdom
of
in
nepal


at
present
this
birth
place
is
called
in
nepal


he
is
said
to
have
received
enlightenment
in
india


at
that
time
a
clan
called
the
ruled


his
father
was
a
king
named
and
his
mother
was
the
beautiful


lived
in
luxury
his
father
kept
trouble
and
hard
work
far
from
him


a
seer
predicted
that
if
stayed
inside
his
palace
his
whole
life
then
he
would
become
a
great
king


however
if
he
left
the
palace
then
he
would
become
a
great
religious
leader


the
king
did
not
want
his
son
to
become
a
religious
leader


he
kept
in
the
palace
for
his
whole
childhood


when
he
was
older
his
father
found
a
woman
for
to
marry
at
the
age
of


he
married
the
woman
named
and
they
had
a
son


although
had
everything
he
could
want
he
still
was
not
happy


he
wanted
to
learn
the
meaning
of
his
existence


he
got
out
of
the
castle
against
his
father
orders


he
saw
the
four
passing
sights
an
old
crippled
man
a
sick
man
a
dead
man
and
a
holy
man
with
no
home


right
then
knew
that
nothing
can
stop
people
from
being
born
becoming
old
getting
sick
and
dying


he
decided
to
give
up
his
worldly
life


he
would
not
keep
his
wives
his
children
his
wealth
or
his
palace


he
would
become
a
holy
man
with
no
home


he
would
look
for
the
answer
to
the
problem
of
birth
old
age
sickness
and
death


he
left
his
home
in
the
middle
of
a
dark
and
<collocation>stormy night</collocation>


seeking
answers
at
that
time
holy
men
were
usually
ascetics


they
hurt
their
bodies
in
order
to
help
their
spiritual
beings


they
do
not
do
things
they
like
so
they
can
defeat
their
desires


the
most
ascetic
kinds
of
holy
men
were
called


they
practiced
and
made
themselves
suffer
very
much


they
believed
this
would
free
the
soul
from
pain
and
sadness


did
these
things
well


eventually
he
was
better
than
his
teachers


he
still
found
no
answer
and
he
left
his
teachers


some
friends
and
he
went
even
farther


he
ate
only
six
grains
of
rice
a
day


he
tried
holding
his
breath


he
became
just
skin
and
bones
and
he
nearly
died


still
he
had
no
answer


started
to
think
again
about
this
path


he
thought
there
might
be
a
better
way
than
hurting
himself


he
found
a
big
tree
now
called
the
<collocation>bodhi tree</collocation>
and
started
to
meditate


he
told
himself
that
he
would
not
get
up
until
he
had
found
enlightenment


he
meditated
under
the
tree
for
days


his
mind
is
said
to
have
become
pure
and
then
six
years
after
he
began
his
path
he
said
he
found
enlightenment
and
became
a
buddha


the
life
as
a
buddha
also
known
as
deer
park
is
said
to
be
the
place
where
the
buddha
first
taught


when
the
buddha
became
enlightened
he
knew
the
answer
to
suffering
and
he
knew
how
to
defeat
suffering


this
answer
was
called
the
four
noble
truths


he
was
not
sure
if
he
should
teach
his
new
ideas
or
not


he
asked
himself
if
the
world
was
ready
for
such
a
deep
teaching


but
in
the
end
he
decided
to
travel
to
a
town
called
to
teach
the
people
his
new
way


he
taught
about
the
four
noble
truths
and
the
noble
eightfold
path


the
people
listened
to
him


when
he
taught
he
did
not
pretend
to
be
a
god


he
said
he
was
just
a
man
who
had
found
the
meaning
of
life
enlightenment
and
that
any
person
can
also
find
the
meaning
of
life


for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
walked
all
over
southern
nepal
and
parts
of

to
teach
people
what
he
believed


he
started
a

buddha
are

buddhism
is
mostly
about
ending
the
feeling
of

feel
inside

a
part
of
all

is
because
of
desire


and
he
showed
that

end
pain
by
doing
good
things

things
and
training
