there
are
two
main
types
of
total
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
rod
the
retina
has
no
cone
cells


this
makes
it
difficult
to
see
even
lights
of
a
normal
level
this
means
that
people
who
suffer
from
it
are
almost
blind


it
occurs
almost
only
on
the
island
of
a
part
of
the
state
in
the
federated
states
of
micronesia


there
it
is
called
about
one
person
in
of
the
population
has
it


the
island
was
hit
by
a
storm
in
the
century


very
few
men
survived
the
storm


one
of
them
carried
a
gene
for
rod


today
several
hundred
people
live
on
the
island
about
have
this
gene


cone
the
retina
has
both
rods
and
cones
but
only
one
type
kind
of
cone


people
who
suffer
from
this
will
be
able
to
see
patterns
well
in
normal
daylight
but
they
will
not
see
hues


<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
there
are
two
kinds
of
red
green
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
or


is
the
most
common
form
of
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
between
five
and
ten
percent
of
males
suffer
from
it


those
affected
have
trouble
telling
the
difference
between
red
and
green


as
seen
by
people
suffering
from
red
is
darkened


most
often
this
is
because
they
lack
the
receptors
for
long
or
medium
length
light
waves
or
because
these
receptors
have
changed
their
sensitivity


<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
although
the
name
is
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
people
affected
by
this
type
of
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
can
usually
tell
the
difference
between
blue
and
yellow


instead
they
can
not
tell
the
difference
between
blue
and
green
and
also
yellow
and
violet


it
is
different
from
the
other
types
of
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
because
it
is
not
linked
to
sex


it
affects
both
sexes
equally


it
occurs
because
those
affected
lack
receptors
for
short
wavelengths
or
because
these
receptor
changed
their
sensitivity


other
causes
of
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
sometimes
people
do
not
have
problems
seeing
color
but
their
brain
has
trouble
telling
the
color
and
interprets
it
wrong


it
is
also
possible
that
only
certain
parts
of
the
eye
have
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
people
may
become
color
blind
because
of
other
diseases
but
after
the
disease
goes
away
see
normally
again


this
seems
to
be
the
case
with
certain
forms
of
migraine


how
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
is
inherited
males
have
one
x
and
one
<collocation>y chromosome</collocation>
females
have
two
x
chromosomes


many
of
the
genes
involved
in
making
color
vision
work
are
on
the
x
chromosome
they
are
sex
linked


for
this
reason
men
are
more
often
affected
by
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
than
women


the
color
blind
gene
allows
blind
people
see
the
difference
between
red
and
green


the
gene
is
located
on
the
x
chromosome


this
means
that
a
male
will
be
color
blind
if
the
single
x
he
inherits
from
his
mother
contains
the
color
blind
version
of
the
color
blind
gene


a
female
will
inherit
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
only
if
she
inherits
two
x
chromosomes
containing
defective
mutant
color
gene
alleles


in
other
words
a
female
needs
to
inherit
color
blind
genes
from
both
parents
in
order
to
be
color
blind


finding
out
if
someone
suffers
from
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
someone
who
is
not
color
blind
will
clearly
see
the
number
here


a
person
with
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
may
either
see
or
no
number
at
all


special
tests
have
been
developed


these
usually
have
an
image
with
dots
of
different
colors


people
will
then
see
different
images
most
often
arabic
numbers


those
with
certain
types
of
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
will
see
different
numbers
from
those
not
affected
by
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>


because
many
young
children
have
not
learned
numbers
yet
other
tests
have
been
developed


they
use
symbols
like
a
square
a
circle
or
a
car
instead
of
numbers


design
changes
a
color
code
is
when
there
is
much
information
in
the
color
of
certain
item


such
codes
can
not
be
understood
easily
by
those
who
are
color
blind


for
this
reason
color
should
not
be
used
alone
to
give
information


good
<collocation>graphic design</collocation>
avoids
using
color
coding
or
color
differences
alone
to
give
information


this
does
not
only
help
color
blind
people
but
also
normally
sighted
people


cascading
style
sheets
can
be
used
on
web
pages


they
allow
to
give
a
different
color
scheme
for
color
blind
people


certain
color
scheme
generators
help
graphic
designers
see
<collocation>color schemes</collocation>
as
eight
types
of
color
blind
people
see
them


<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
is
very
sensitive
to
changes
in
material


a
color
blind
person
may
be
unable
to
see
the
difference
between
colors
on
a
map
printed
on
paper


the
same
map
on
a
computer
screen
or
television
may
appear
normally


in
addition
some
color
blind
people
find
it
easier
to
tell
the
difference
between
colors
on
artificial
materials
such
as
plastic
or
in
acrylic
paints
than
on
natural
materials
such
as
paper
or
wood


thirdly
for
some
color
blind
people
color
can
only
be
broken
link
distinguish
distinguished
if
there
is
enough
color
thin
lines
might
appear
black
but
a
thicker
line
of
the
same
color
can
be
seen
in
the
correct
color


kill
switches
such
as
this
one
have
to
follow
very
specific
design
rules


these
rules
include
what
colors
to
use


in
certain
cases
when
it
is
important
to
understand
information
very
quickly
the
visual
system
may
drop
the
colors
and
only
work
in
shades
of
gray


this
is
important
to
know
when
designing
the
interfaces
for
objects
that
need
to
be
used
in
an
emergency
situation
like
<collocation>emergency brakes</collocation>
or
emergency
telephones


because
color
blind
people
may
not
see
the
difference
between
colors
such
as
red
and
green
some
countries
such
as
have
refused
to
give
them
driving
licenses


in
people
have
started
to
change
the
laws
so
that
color
blind
people
will
also
be
able
to
drive
legally


in
the
<collocation>united kingdom</collocation>
electricity
wires
in
houses
used
to
be
red
black
and
green


they
were
changed
to
brown
blue
and
to
help
color
blind
people
see
the
difference
between
the
live
and
earth
wires


what
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
is
not
many
people
do
not
understand
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>


people
who
are
color
blind
never
swap
the
colors
they
are
blind
to


they
may
have
trouble
telling
two
colors
from
one
another


that
way
they
may
have
a
problem
finding
the
right
kind
of
apple
in
the
supermarket


the
image
below
first
shows
the
way
that
two
apples
look
to
a
person
with
normal

and
then
the
way
it

history
ancient
at
the
time
of
the
roman
empire
there
was
a
city
here
called


the
main
square
of
is
in
the
same
place
as
the
forum
or
main
square
of
roman
times


after
this
the
city
was
probably
deserted


when
the
hungarians
arrived
in
the
area
it
was
in
ruins


in
the
centuries
hungarians
strengthened
the
old
roman
city
walls
and
built
a
castle


the
town
got
its
hungarian
name
of
from
a
steward
of
the
castle
named


by
it
was
an
important
town


in
king
ii
of
bohemia
took
over
the
castle
and
took
the
children
of
noble
families
as
hostage


but
the
people
of
the
city
opened
the
gates
when
the
army
of
king
iv
of
hungary
arrived


the
king
made
a
free
royal
town


in
hungary
was
invaded
by
ottoman
turks
who
destroyed
many
parts
of
the
city
but
did
not
take
it
over


many
people
from
other
towns
fled
to
for
safety


in
most
of
the
ancient
buildings
in
the
city
were
destroyed
by
a
fire


when
they
were
replaced
they
were
in
a
new
style
called
baroque


many
of
the
baroque
buildings
are
standing
today


was
an
important
town
in
the
empire


in
the
early
it
became
part
of
austria


but
the
townspeople
were
not
happy
with
this
and
in
december
they
voted
that
the
city
should
be
part
of
hungary


since
that
day
the
city
has
been
called
the
most
<collocation>loyal town</collocation>
which
in
hungarian
is
a


a
holiday
is
held
every

ii
suffered
badly


it
was
bombed
several
times


there
were
many
jewish
people
living
in
before
the
war


the
nazis
and
their
hungarian
allies
sent
the
jews
of
to
death
camps
and
killed
nearly
all
of
them
as
well
as
other
people
who
disagreed
with
nazi
ideas


the
soviet
red
army
captured
the
city
on
april


as
part
of
hungary
was
ruled
by
a
socialist
government


at
this
time
many
factories
were
built
around


the
socialist
government
took
away
a
lot
of
the
freedom
that
people
had


in
august
in
there
was
a
big
protest
against
the
socialist
government
which
was
called
the
picnic


while
this
was
happening
more
than
people
who
lived
in
east
germany
which
was
socialist
escaped
to
the
west


this
was
the
beginning
of
a
big
change
for
all
the
socialist
countries
of
europe


people
who
had
not
been
allowed
to
travel
or
live
in
other

were
finally
allowed
to
be
free

<collocation>stellar evolution</collocation>
is
the
study
of
how
a
star
changes
over
time


stars
can
change
very
much
between
when
they
are
first
created
and
when
they
run
out
of
energy


because
stars
can
produce
light
and
heat
for
millions
or
billions
of
years
scientists
study
<collocation>stellar evolution</collocation>
by
studying
many
different
stars
in
different
stages
of
their
life


the
stages
in
a
star
life
are
nebula
star
red
giant
and
either
white
dwarf
followed
by
black
dwarf
neutron
star
or
black
hole


the
sun
how
a
star
is
born
a
star
starts
its
life
as
a
cloud
of
dust
and
gas
called
a
nebula


this
is
pulled
together
by
gravity
which
causes
it
to
heat
up


it
also
starts
to
spin
and
to
look
like
a
ball


when
it
gets
hot
enough
it
starts
to
release
energy
through
nuclear
fusion
changing
hydrogen
to
helium


this
makes
it
shine
very
brightly
and
become
what
astronomers
think
of
as
a
star


it
may
stay
a
star
looking
about
the
same
for
billions
of
years


how
a
star
enters
old
age
sooner
or
later
almost
all
of
the
hydrogen
at
the
center
has
changed
to
helium


this
causes
the
nuclear
reaction
in
the
middle
of
the
star
to
stop
and
the
center
will
start
to
get
smaller
due
to
the
star
gravity


the
layer
of
the
star
just
outside
the
center
will
begin
to
change
hydrogen
to
helium
releasing
energy


the
outer
layers
of
the
star
will
get
much
much
bigger


the
star
will
make
much
more
light
sometimes
as
much
as
ten
thousand
times
as
much
as
it
did
at
first
