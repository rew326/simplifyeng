now
everyone
who

languages
filipino

based
largely
on

and
neighboring
provinces


the
filipino
language
is
a
cousin
of

culture
before
the
spanish
arrived
the
filipinos
did
not
think
of
themselves
as
one
people


most
of
the
philippines
were
buddhist
muslim
and
hindu
empires


the
spaniards
came
in
and
brought
with
them
spanish
culture


they
soon
spread
to
the
islands
making
forts
and
schools
preaching
christianity
and
converting
most
of
the
native
peoples
to
the
catholic
religion


when
the
united
states
colonized
the
islands
in
the
americans
brought
with
them
their
culture
which
has
the
strongest
influence
up
to
now


this
makes
the
philippines
the
most
westernized
country
in
eastern
asia


the
spanish
culture
in
the
philippines
though
is
not
directly
from
spain
but
from
mexico


since
the
philippines
was
ruled
by
spain
through
mexico


it
was
governed
from
mexico
city
which
explains
much
of
the
spanish
influence
in
the
philippines
that
one
could
only
find
in
mexico
and
not
in
spain


also
the
spanish
that
was
spoken
in
the
philippines
was
mexican
spanish
not
european
spanish


a
lot
of
the
foods
in
the
philippines
can
also
be
found
in
mexico

as
a
tradition
usually
eat
with
hands
which
of

tradition


and
most
of

cuisine
is

for
the
most
part


each
