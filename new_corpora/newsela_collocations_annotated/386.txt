to
power
with
a
socialist
plan


his
vision
for
chile
was
one
in
which
the
country
resources
and
wealth
would
be
owned
by
and
distributed
more
democratically

major
industries


such
as

copper
mines
chile
had
one
of
the
largest
copper
mines
in
the
world
but
these
mines
were
not
owned
by
but
by
very
powerful
business
people


this
created
a
serious
problem
with

many
of

reforms

programs
revolved
around
socialism


he
created

took
a
stronger
level

control
within
the
economy


he
died

his
death
has
been
disputed
for
years
some
feel
that
he
took
his
own
life
by
committing
suicide
but
others
feel
that
he
was
murdered
by
militia

then

and
myth

replaced
by

who
overthrew

the
new
<collocation>ruling junta</collocation>
justified
their
coup
claiming
that
chile
could
no
longer
tolerate
the
cancer
of
marxism


the
regime
claimed
had
violated
the
chilean
constitution
strange
considering
that
ended
up
writing
a
completely
new
one


also
after
the
coup
many
rumors
and
myths
emerged
about
death
and
life


many
of
these
myths
attempted
to
discredit
the
character
of
make
him
appear
as
a
coward
weak
or
cruel
person
some
of
his
enemies
claimed
he

one
of
the
more
current
myths
about
has
been
that
he
was
an
and
white
supremacist
odd
considering
that
he
was
a
mestizo
with
jewish
extraction
who
advocated
marxism
which
teaches
that
people
are
divided
by
class
not
race
ethnicity
or
nationality


legacy
and
place
in
history
became
of
interest
to
people
all
over
the
world
because
he
was
the
first
democratically
elected
socialist
in
chile
and
the
first
democratically
elected
marxist
in
the
world


many
people
felt
was
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
in
which
great
changes
to
society
especially
in
developing
countries
could
be
brought
about
peacefully

authority
is
the
ability
of
a
person
or
an
organization
to
conduct
a
certain
lifestyle
for
another
person
or
a
group


authority
is
known
as
one
of
the
basis
of
society
and
stands
against
cooperation


adopting
lifestyle
patterns
as
a
result
of
authority
is
called
obedience
and
authority
as
a
concept
includes
most
leadership
cases


although
authority
is
usually
described
as
human
there
also
<collocation>frequent mention</collocation>
of
divine
authority


authority
is
made
by
a
certain
social
power


this
power
might
be
materialistic
such
as
a
threat
to
harm
someone
or
fictitious
such
as
belief
in
a
certain
person
power


the
power
exists
because
of
the
possible
use
of
sanction
an
action
who
harms
a
person
who
not
obeying
the
authority
or
threatening
it
in
order
to
conduct
a
social
power


authority
may
exists
in
a
direct
way
by
virtue
of
an
actual
power
such
as
a
threat
of
imprisonment
which
is
called
forcing
or
by
that
the
subject
gives
to
the
authority
such
as
recognition
of
<collocation>aristocratic authority</collocation>


in
most
cases
both
types
exist


only
a
few
authorities
are
based
on
physical
power
most
are
based
on
an
organizational
authority
system


in
this
way
the
ability
to
act
depends
on
her
existence


for
example
the
authority
of
a
state
leader
takes
part
when
there
some
sort
of
a
police
that
punishes
individuals
that
do
not
obey
him


the
policeman
are
subordinated
to
the
leader
and
his
rules
because
they
are
also
under
the
police
threat


if
all
citizens
of
the
state
choose
to
deny
the
leader
and
his
rules
the
authority
will
be
lost
but
the
very
fact
that
the
authority

be

obedience
obedience
as
said
is
the
sign
that
means
authority
is
being
enforced


while
obedience
is
the
law
disobedience
and
crime
are
violation
and
resistance
to
the
authority


theoretically
violation
of
the
authority
drags
with
it
a
sanction
or
punishment
that
given
by
the
authority
owner


the
severity
of
the
sanction
and
the
threat
it
presents
are
based
on
the
particular
social
situation
on
the
balance
of
power
on
the
<collocation>local norms</collocation>
and
so
on


stanley
was
a
psychologist
who
was
interested
in
obedience


he
designed
an
experiment
to
measured
how
willing
people
were
to
do
what
an
authority
figure
told
them
to
do


the
experiment
had
three
participants


the
person
running
the
experiment
told
one
participant
the
volunteer
to
pretend
to
be
a
teacher


another
participant
was
an
actor
but
the
volunteer
did
know
this


the
actor
role
was
to
be
the
teacher
student


the
actor
and
the
volunteer
were
separated
with
a
wall


the
person
running
the
experiment
told
the
volunteer
to
test
their
student
ability
to
remember
pairs
of
words


when
the
teacher
student
remembered
a
pair
of
words
incorrectly
the
experimenter
told
the
teacher
to
give
the
student
an
electric
shock
from
an
electroshock
generator


the
electric
shocks
were
not
real
but
the
volunteer
did
not
know
this


every
time
the
student
got
a
question
wrong
the
voltage
of
the
shock
went
up
by
volts


in
first
set
of
experiments
of
the
volunteers
gave
the
highest
shock


it
was
volts


had
two
theories
for
why
he
got
the
results
he
did


the
first
is
the
theory
of
conformism


based
this
theory
on
solomon
<collocation>conformity experiments</collocation>


the
second
is
the
state
theory


according
to
state
theory
the
participants
who
obeyed
the
experimenter
orders
did
this
because
they
did
not
see
themselves
as
responsible
for
their
actions


criticism
many
people
criticize
people
in
authority
and
some
even
criticize
the
existence
of
authority


anarchism
is
a
philosophy
that
opposes
all
forms
of

the
city

the
pupil
is
the
central
transparent
area
showing
as
black
the
pupil
is
the
black
opening
in
the
center
of
the
eye


light
enters
through
the
pupil
and
goes
through
the
lens
which
focuses
the
image
on
the
retina


the
size
of
the
pupil
is
controlled
by
muscles


when
more
light
is
needed
the
pupil
is
made
larger


in
brighter
light
the
pupil
is
made
smaller


the
pupil
can
be
compared
with
the
shutter
of
a
camera


it
is
surrounded
by
the
iris
which
is
the
color
part
of
the
eye


a
pupil
changes
its
size
depending
on
the
length
away
that
the
focus
point
is
the
focus
point
being
the
object
that
the
eye
is
focusing
on


also
the
light
makes
the
pupil
change
its
size


when
it
is
darker
the
pupils
will
dilate
get
bigger
because
they
need
to
allow
more
light
into
the
eye
to
see


when
it
is
very
bright
the
pupil
will
constrict
get
smaller
to
restrict
the
amount
of
light
there
is
getting
into
the
eye
so
we
can
see


the
pupil
is
normally
black
in
most
animals
but
in
some
reptiles
it
can
be
a
different
color


a
translator
reads
something
written
in
one
language
and
speaks
it
or
writes
it
in
another
language


for
example
they
could
read
a
book
in
french
and
then
translate
it
into
english


see
translation
for
more
information


in
order
to
convert
meanings
from
one
language
into
another
one
translators
must
be
able
to
know
deeply
about
the
target
culture
so
that
they
are
effective
in
conveying
the
original
meaning
of
the
source
text
or
material


as
a
result
translators
do
not
only
convert
words
what
makes
it
deeper
than
a
science
but
an
art


translation
is
a
complex
activity
mainly
because
to
interact
and
to
communicate
between
languages
require
more
than
in
the
source
and
the
target
languages
but
flexibility
between
them
in
an
effective
way
for
a
specific
audience
or
special
readers


it
is
a
sort
of
occupation
and
career
that
is
mainly
based
on
research
and
great
skills
for
languages
