pluto
was
considered
a
planet
until
august
when
the
international
astronomical
union
defined
conditions
for

eris

<collocation>elliptical path</collocation>

other
some
scientists
think
that
there
was
once
a
planet
called
which
crashed
into
the
earth
at
one
point
creating
the
moon


definition
of
a
<collocation>planet technically</collocation>
there
was
never
a
scientific
definition
of
the
term
planet
before


when
the
greeks
observed
the
sky
thousands
of
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
they
discovered
objects
that
acted
differently
than
stars


these
points
of
light
seemed
to
wander
around
the
sky
throughout
the
year


the
term
planet
is
derived
from
the
greek
word
meaning
wanderer


recently
however
the
international
astronomical
union
convened
a
planet
definition
committee
deliberated
and
ultimately
reached
consensus
on
a
new
definition
of
planet
which
leaves
us
with
the
eight
planets
we
today
consider
to
comprise
our
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
thus
the
exit
of
pluto


that
new
definition
a
planet
is
a
celestial
body
that
a
is
in
orbit
around
the
sun
b
has
sufficient
mass
for
its
to
overcome
rigid
body
forces
so
that
it
assumes
a
equilibrium
nearly
round
shape
and
c
has
cleared
the
neighborhood
around
its
orbit
meaning
there
are
no
other
bodies
in
its
path
that
it
must
sweep
up
as
it
goes
around
the
sun

periodic
comets
have
a
special
place
in
astronomy
because
their
orbits
are
often
the

we
know
when
they
will
visit
us
and
we
can
plan
to
watch
them
and
send
space
probes
to
look
at
them


on
august
the
international
astronomical
union
standardized
the
way
we
give
names
to
this
type
of
comets


it
made
a
system
of
letters
and
numbers
and
sometimes
a
name


this
system
tells
us
which
comet
is

the
chose
the
letter
p
for
periodic

and
d
for
periodic
comets
that

lost

which

other
letters
are
c
for
comets
and
x
for

where
we
do
not
know
their
orbits


it
also
allows
for
type

say

only


if

displacement
method
referred

no
information
is
gained
about
the
inclination
of
the

plane
of
orbit
around
its
star
and
a
value
for
this
is
needed
to
calculate
the

it
has
become
customary
to
arbitrarily
assume
that
the
plane
is
exactly
lined
up
with
the
line
of

list

date
february
this
is
a
list
of
tallest
structures
in
the
world
past
and
present
of
any
type


most
of
the
structures
are
television
broadcasting
masts


there
are
also
the
taller
structures
like
the
tower
and
the
taller
high
rise
buildings
like
the
<collocation>sears tower</collocation>


the
list
also
includes
some
other
structures
like
oil
platforms
electrical
towers
bridge
towers


list
is
organized
by
absolute
height
since
it
includes
many
different
classes
of
structures


this
list
includes
quite
a
few
masts


a
mast
is
a
support
structure
commonly
used
on

ships
as

for
sails

on

terminology
there
is
often
ambiguity
between
the
terms
tower
and
mast


a
tower
is
a
or
structure
while
a
mast
is
held
up
by
stays
or
guys


both
towers
and
masts
have
limited
floor
space
and
are
structures
as
opposed
to
regular
buildings
which
have
greater
floor
space
for
occupancy


the
terminology
is
further
confused
through
misuse


skyscrapers
are
often
referred
to
as
towers
and
some
towers
use
the
term
mast


ironically
skyscraper
has
some
etymology
from
references
to
<collocation>high sailboat</collocation>
masts


list
by
height
notes
a
minimum
height
limit
of
m
ft
or
m
ft
for
notable
structures
is
used
for
<collocation>practical purposes</collocation>
to
keep
the
list
to
a
reasonable
length


likely
structures
still
missing
from
this
list
include
masts
used
for
the
russian
navigation
system


structures
no
longer
standing
are
in
italics


for
all
structures
the
<collocation>pinnacle height</collocation>
is
given


so
the
height
of
skyscrapers
may
differ
from
the
values
at
list
of
skyscrapers


most
of
the
<collocation>taller masts</collocation>
are
in
the
united
states
where
a
prevalence
of
masts
of
around
feet
m
in
height
is
the
result
of
special
rules
in
that
country
limiting
structures
and
objects
taller

how
acids
work
acids
and
bases
typically
exist
together
in
equilibrium


this
means
that
within
a
sample
of
an
acid
some
molecules
will
give
up
their
protons
and
others
will
accept
them


even
water
is
a
mixture
of
an
acidic
ion
h
o
called
a
ion
and
a
basic
ion
oh
called
a
<collocation>hydroxide ion</collocation>


a
ion
will
give
up
its
proton
to
a
<collocation>hydroxide ion</collocation>
forming
two
molecules
of
h
o
which
is
neutral


this
reaction
happens
continuously
in
a
sample
of
water
but
overall
the
sample
is
neutral
because
there
are
equal
amounts
of
and
hydroxide
in
the
sample


for
most
reactions
however
the
acids
and
bases
are
not
present
in
equal
amounts
and
this
imbalance
is
what
allows
a
chemical
reaction
to
occur


every
acid
has
a
<collocation>conjugate base</collocation>
formed
by
removing
the
acid
proton


hydrochloric
acid
for
example
is
an
acid
and
its
<collocation>conjugate base</collocation>
is
a
chlorine
anion
or
cl


an
acid
and
its
<collocation>conjugate base</collocation>
are
opposite
in
strength

strong
acid
cl
is
a
weak
base

acids
and

bases
are
the
opposites
of
acids


acids
can
have
different
strengths
some
are
more
reactive
than
others


more
reactive
acids
are
often
more
dangerous


acids
can
have
a
lot
of
different
properties
depending
on
their
molecular
structure


most

skin
when
they

acids
can

the
skin


the
burn
can
be
serious
or
minor
depending
on
the
kind
of
acid
and
how
concentrated
it
is


burns
like
this
can
be
a
serious
problem


chemical
burns
like
this
need
medical
attention
immediately


because
acids
donate
hydrogen
ions
all
acids
must
have
hydrogen
in
them


importance
acids

important


<collocation>nucleic acids</collocation>

these
molecules

<collocation>fatty acids</collocation>

derivatives
are
another
group
of
carboxylic
acids
that
play
a

these

hydrochloric
acid

acid
secreted
