finland
was
a
part
of
sweden


then
in
the
year
russia
took
finland
from
sweden


finland
was
a
part
of
russia
but
after
a
short
period
of
time
it
became
autonomous
which
means
that
the

essentially
controlled
finland
though
the

was
in
control
officially


finns
could
create
their
own
laws
and
had
their
own
currency
called

and
own

however
finland
did
not
have
its
own
army


finnish
soldiers
at
the
time
of

on
december
finland
became
independent
which
meant
that
it
no
longer
was
a
part
of

there
was
a
communist
revolution
in
russia
and
after
russia
was
a
part
of
the
soviet
union


there
were
communists
in
finland
too
who
tried
to
create
a
revolution
in

this

caused

the
dictator
of

wanted

that

they
joined

invasion
which
started
in


this
part
of

was
losing
the

finland
had
already
progressed
into
the
soviet

in
order
to
regain
the
areas
lost
in
the
previous
peace


finland
wanted
to
end
the
war
with
the
soviet
union
which
resulted
in
peace
but
once
again
finland
had
to
relinquish
the
areas
that
they
had
conquered


this
time
the
peace
with
the
soviet

made
finland

germany
enemies


finns
fought
germans
and
germans
retreated
to
norway
burning
down
the
whole

behind
them


this
is

finland
remained
independent


after
the
war
many
factories
were
built
in

many
people
moved
from

to

at

time
big

manufactured

more

to
show
how
the
language
should
be
used


this
is
a
correct
usage
grammar
as
in
a
textbook
or
manual


the
system
which
people
learn
as
they
grow
up


this
is
the
grammar


when
we
speak
we
use
the
grammar
or
as
near
as
we
can


when
we
write
we
try
to
write
with
correct
grammar


so
speaking
and
writing
a
language
each
have
their
own
style

<collocation>nouns verbs</collocation>
references
different
languages
all
languages
have
their
own
grammar


most
european
languages
are
rather
similar
but
some
such
as
chinese
and
japanese
are
very
different
from
all
european
languages


english
makes
few
changes
to
its
word
endings
suffixes


in
the
italic
or
romance
languages
such
as
french
italian
and
spanish
word
endings
carry
a
lot
of
meaning


in
english
we
have
just
a
few
and
john
are
the
most
common


in
our
verbs
we
have
dropped
most
endings
except
one
i
love
you
love
but
she
love


that
final
is
a
remnant
of
which
had
more
suffixes


verbs
do
have
endings
which
show
changes
in
tense
walk
ed
<collocation>walk ing</collocation>


word
order
is
the
other
big
difference


romance
languages
normally
put
adjectives
after
the
nouns
to
which
they
refer


for
example
in
english
a
person
may
say
i
like
fast
cars
but
in
spanish
it
is
me


the
order
of
the
words
has
changed
if
just
the
words
without
the
grammar
are
translated
into
english
it
would
mean
to
me
they
please
the
cars
fast


this
is
because
spanish
and
english
have
different
rules
about
word
order


in
german
verbs
often
come
near
the
end
of
sentences
whereas
in
english
we
usually
put
them
between
subject
and
object
as
the
cat
has
eaten
the
food


changing
language
written
grammar
changes
slowly
but
spoken
grammar
is
more
fluid


sentences
which
english
speakers
find
normal
today
might
have
seemed
strange
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
