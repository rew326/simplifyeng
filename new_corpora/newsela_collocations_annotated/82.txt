of
the
world
zinc
is
used
for
galvanizing


this
is
used
to
protect
another
metal
usually
iron
from
rusting


the
<collocation>zinc coating</collocation>
corrodes
instead
of
the
iron


the
<collocation>zinc coating</collocation>
can
be
placed
on
the
metal
in
two
ways


the
metal
can
be
dipped
into
a
pot
of
melted
zinc


the
zinc
can
also
be
on
to
the
metal


dipping
lasts
longer
but
has
a
<collocation>patchy surface</collocation>
that
some
do
not
think
looks
nice


it
is
also
used
in
motorboats
and
pipelines
to
<collocation>slow rusting</collocation>


the
motor
of
a
motorboat
often
has
a
bullet
of
zinc
that
will
corrode
easily
but
will
help
other

parts
of
the
motor
to
stay

zinc
is
used
in
alloys


brass
is
an
alloy
of
copper

zinc


brass
is
the
most

zinc
can

zinc
aluminium

aluminium
which
makes

<collocation>commercial bronze</collocation>

an

zinc

older

a

of
zinc
to

if

some
people
say
that

we
should
take

others
say
that
zinc
does
not

there
are
medicines
that

people
add

enzymes


it
is
the
second

wheat

safety
large

toxic


it

when

copper

zinc

can
be
corrosive
in

zebra
appearance
all
zebras
have
very
short
fur
because
they
live
in
hot
areas


their
fur
has
black
and
white
stripes


the
main
part
of
the
body
has
mostly
vertical
stripes
and
the
legs
have
horizontal
stripes


they
also
have
a
dark
line
down
their
back


each
of
the
different
zebra
species
has
a
different
type
of
stripes


each
zebra
has
a
unique
pattern
of
stripes


life
zebras
live
in
families
with
one
male
and
lots
of
females


they
can
have
babies
foals
when
they
are
about
five
years
old
and
can
have
one
foal
every
year


zebras
mainly
eat
grass
but
they
also
eat
fruit
leaves
and
some
vegetables


they
always
live
near
water


they
are
endangered
and
the
numbers
of
zebra
is
dropping


zebras
live
naturally
in
africa

a

garden
<collocation>zoological park</collocation>
or
zoo
is
a
place
where
many
different
species
types
of
animals
are
kept
so
people
can
see
and
watch
them


modern
zoos
try
not
only
to
be
for
people
entertainment
but
for
education
research
and
the
conservation
and
protection
of
animals


many
zoos
are
centers
where
rare
animals
are
preserved
when
they
are
in
danger
of
dying
out


these
modern
zoos
also
want
to
give
the
animals
a
natural
life
so
that
they
are
healthy
and
behave
normal


this
is
done
for
the
animals
but
also
that
people
can
see
the
animals
as
if
they
were
in
nature
and
not
in
a
zoo


in
the
past
but
also
today
there
are
a
lot
of
zoos
that
are
not
like
the
modern
type
of
zoo


there
the
animals
are
held
in
very
bad
conditions


they
are
kept
in
small
cages
and
they
are
bored
and
get
sick

a

<collocation>copyright laws</collocation>
make
it
easier
for

to

by
selling
their

because
of
copyright
a

can
only
be

if

of
the

gives

when
someone
copies
or

a

that

without

the

may
sue
for
the

most

are
handled
by

in
more
serious
cases
a

who
owns
copyright


in
most
countries
authors
automatically
own
the
copyright
to
any
work
they
make
or
create
as
long
as
they
do
not
give
the
copyright
to
someone
else


in
most
countries
there
is
no
need
to
register
the
copyright
and
some
countries
do
not
even
have
procedures
to
register
copyrights


but
where
registration
is
available
many
authors
register
anyway
especially
for
works
that
are
sold
for
money


that
is
because
registration
help
to
prove
that
the
copyright
of
a
work
belongs
to
a
certain
author


if
an
author
gets
paid
to
make
a
work
for
someone
else
the
person
who
pays
for
making
the
work
for
example
the
author
employer
will
often
get
to
own
the
copyright
instead
of
the
author


for
example
if
a
person
working
for
a
company
like
creates
a
new
computer
software
program
at
work
the
company
would
own
the

length
of
copyright
protection
<collocation>copyright laws</collocation>
usually
protect
owners
of
copyright
beyond
their
lifetime
such
as
until
years
after
the
author
death


in
some
countries
this
period
has
been
extended
to
years
in
most
cases


when
the
period
of
copyright
protection
has
ended
the
written
document
musical
composition
book
picture
or
other
creative
work
is
in
the
<collocation>public domain</collocation>


this
means
that
no
one
owns
the
copyright
and
everyone
is
free
to
copy
use
and
change
them
without
having
to
ask
for
permission
or
pay
the
owner


fair
use
there
is
an
exception
to
the
rules
of
copyright
called
fair
use


this
means
that
people
can
copy
a
very
small
amount
of
a
work
to
use
in
reviews
or
in
research
reports


an
example
of
fair
use
is
when
newspaper
writers
quote
several
sentences
from
a
document
to
tell
the
story


another
example
of
fair
use
is
when
a
university
<collocation>professor quotes</collocation>
several
sentences
from
a
book
in
a
review
of

or
in
a

report


copyright
in
different
countries
different
countries
have
different
<collocation>copyright laws</collocation>


most
of
the
differences
are
about
whether
or
not
the
government
work
falls
under
copyright
how
much
longer
copyright
lasts
after
the
author
dies
or
after
the
work
is
created
or
published
and
what
is
and
what
is
not
fair
use


because
of
these
differences
a
certain
piece
of
work
may
be
under
copyright
in
one
country
and
in
the
<collocation>public domain</collocation>
in
another


problems
with
<collocation>copyright creativity</collocation>
some
people
argue
that
<collocation>copyright laws</collocation>
make
it
easier
for
people
to
make
new
works
and
think
of
new
ideas


after
all
if
authors
get
to
make
money
for
the
time
effort
and
money
they
put
in
then
they
will
want
to
make
more
works
later
and
make
more
money


but
others
believe
that
<collocation>copyright laws</collocation>
make
it
harder
to
be
creative


without
copyright
other
people
could
reuse
existing
work
and
copyright
law
often
stops
that


publisher
control
if
an
author
wants
to
sell
a
work
it
often
easiest
to
give
the
copyright
to
a
publisher


the
publisher
will
do
all
the
selling
and
in
return
for
that
service
will
keep
part
of
the
money


but
the
publisher
has
many
different
things
to
sell
and
they
may
not
want
to
sell
the
work
the
author
made


authors
often
find
it
very
hard
to
find
a
publisher
willing
to
sell
their
work


but
without
a
publisher
it
can
be
even
harder
for
an
author
to
sell
his
or
her
work


in
many
markets
a
few
big
publishers
own
the
copyrights
to
almost
everything
available
and
stores
will
not
want
to
sell
works
published
by
small
authors
themselves


many
people
say
copyright
law
helps
big
publishers
stay
in
control
and
keeps
smaller
authors
out
of
the
market


tragedy
of
the


open
content
main
open
content
as
a
solution
to
these
problems
groups
of
authors
have
come
up
with
the
idea
of
open
content


with
open
content
authors
give
everyone
permission
to
copy
change
and
give
away
or
sell
their
works
as
long
as
they
follow
certain
rules


these
rules
are
explained
in
an
open
content
license


some
possible
open
content
rules
are
if
a
person
changes
the
work
or
if
a
person
makes
a
new
derivative
work
based
on
it
they
must
give
the
original
author
credit
they
must
say
who
wrote
it


if
a
person
publishes
the
changed
or
derivative
piece
of
work
they
must
let
others
use
it
under
the
same
free
license


under
some
licenses
a
person
can
not
sell
the
piece
of
work
or
use
it
to
make
money
