it
has
to
predict
frequencies
when
the
electrons
involved
are
moving
between
orbits
close
to
the
nucleus
center
of
the
atom
but
it
also
has
to
predict
that
the
frequencies
will
get
closer
and
closer
together
as
we
look
at
what
the
electron
does
in
moving
between
orbits
farther
and
farther
out


it
will
also
predict
that
the
intensity
differences
between
frequencies
get
closer
and
closer
together
as
we
go
out


where
classical
physics
already
gives
the
right
answers
by
one
set
of
equations
the
new
physics
has
to
give
the
same
answers
but
by
different
equations


classical
physics
uses
the
methods
of
the
french
mathematician
fourier
to
make
a
math
picture
of
the
physical
world
and
it
uses
collections
of
<collocation>smooth curves</collocation>
that
go
together
to
make
one
<collocation>smooth curve</collocation>
that
gives
in
this
case
for
light
of
all
frequencies
from
some
light


but
it
is
not
right
because
that
<collocation>smooth curve</collocation>
only
appears
at
higher
frequencies


at
lower
frequencies
there
are
always
isolated
points
and
nothing
connects
the
dots


so
to
make
a
map
of
the
real
world
had
to
make
a
big
change


he
had
to
do
something
to
pick
out
only
the
numbers
that
would
match
what
was
seen
in
nature


sometimes
people
say
he
guessed
these
equations
but
he
was
not
making
<collocation>blind guesses</collocation>


he
found
what
he
needed


the
numbers
that
he
calculated
would
put
dots
on
a
graph
but
there
would
be
no
line
drawn
between
the
dots


and
making
one
graph
just
of
dots
for
every
set
of
calculations
would
have
wasted
lots
of
paper
and
not
have
gotten
anything
done


found
a
way
to
efficiently
predict
the
for
different
frequencies
and
to
organize
that
information
in
a
helpful
way


just
using
the
empirical
rule
given
above
the
one
that
got
started
and
improved
we
can
see
how
to
get
one
set
of
numbers
that
would
help
get
the
kind
of
picture
that
he
wanted
the
rule
says
that
when
the
electron
moves
from
one
orbit
to
another
it
either
gains
or
loses
energy
depending
on
whether
it
is
getting
farther
from
the
center
or
nearer
to
it


so
we
can
put
these
orbits
or
energy
levels
in
as
headings
along
the
top
and
the
side
of
a
grid


for
historical
reasons
the
lowest
orbit
is
called
n
and
the
next
orbit
out
is
called
n
a
then
comes
n
b
and
so
forth


it
is
confusing
that
they
used
negative
numbers
when
the
electrons
were
actually
gaining
energy
but
that
is
just
the
way
it
is


since
the
rule
gives
us
frequencies
we
can
use
that
rule
to
put
in
numbers
depending
on
where
the
electron
goes


if
the
electron
starts
at
n
and
ends
up
at
n
then
it
has
not
really
gone
anywhere
so
it
did
not
gain
energy
and
it
did
not
lose
energy


so
the
frequency
is


if
the
electron
starts
at
and
ends
up
at
n
then
it
has
fallen
from
a
higher
orbit
to
a
lower
orbit


if
it
does
so
then
it
loses
energy
and
the
energy
it
loses
shows
up
as
a
photon


the
photon
has
a
certain
amount
of
energy
e
and
that
is
related
to
a
certain
frequency
f
by
the
equation
e
h
f


so
we
know
that
a
certain
change
of
orbit
is
going
to
produce
a
certain
frequency
of
light
f


if
the
electron
starts
at
n
and
ends
up
at
n
a
that
means
it
has
gone
from
a
lower
orbit
to
a
higher
orbit


that
only
happens
when
a
photon
of
a
certain
frequency
and
energy
comes
in
from
the
outside
is
absorbed
by
the
electron
and
gives
it
its
energy
and
that
is
what
makes
the
electron
go
out
to
a
higher
orbit


so
to
keep
everything
making
sense
we
write
that
frequency
as
a
negative
number


there
was
a
photon
with
a
certain
frequency
and
now
it
has
been
taken
away


so
we
can
make
a
grid
like
this
where
f
a
b
means
the
frequency
involved
when
an
electron
goes
from
energy
state
orbit
b
to
energy
state
a
again
sequences
look
backwards
but
that
is
the
way
they
were
originally
written


grid
of
f
electron
states
n
n
f

transition
did
not
make
the
grids
like
this


he
just
did
the
math
that
would
let
him
get
the
he
was
looking
for


but
to
do
that
he
had
to
multiply
two
how
high
a
wave
measures
to
work
out
the
intensity


in
classical
physics
intensity
equals
amplitude
squared


he
made
an
equation
to
handle
this
problem
wrote
out
the
rest
of
his
paper
handed
it
to
his
boss
and
went
on
vacation


born
looked
at
his
funny
equation
and
it
seemed
a
little
crazy


he
must
have
wondered
why
did
give
me
this
strange
thing


why
does
he
have
to
do
it
this
way


then
he
realized
that
he
was
looking
at
a
blueprint
for
something
he
already
knew
very
well


he
was
used
to
calling
the
grid
or
table
that
we
could
write
by
doing
for
instance
all
the
math
for
frequencies
a
matrix


and
<collocation>weird equation</collocation>
was
a
rule
for
multiplying
two
of
them
together


max
born
was
a
very
very
good
mathematician


he
knew
that
since
the
two
matrices
grids
being
multiplied
represented
different
things
like
position
x
y
z
and
momentum
for
instance
then
when
you
multiply
the
first
matrix
by
the
second
you
get
one
answer
and
when
you
multiply
the
second
matrix
by
the
first
matrix
you
get
another
answer


even
though
he
did
not
know
about
matrix
math
already
saw
this
different
answers
problem
and
it
had
bothered
him


but
born
was
such
a
good
mathematician
that
he
saw
that
the
difference
between
the
first
matrix
multiplication
and
the
second
matrix
multiplication
was
always
going
to
involve
constant
h
multiplied
by
the
square
root
of
negative
one
i


so
within
a
few
days
of
discovery
they
already
had
the
basic
math
for
what
liked
to
call
the
indeterminacy
principle


by
indeterminate
meant
that
something
like
an
electron
is
just
not
pinned
down
until
it
gets
pinned
down


it
is
a
little
like
a
jellyfish
that
is
always
squishing
around
and
can
not
be
in
one
place
unless
you
kill
it


later
people
got
in
the
habit
of
calling
it
uncertainty
principle
which
made
many
people
make
the
mistake
of
thinking
that
electrons
and
things
like
that
are
really
somewhere
but
we
are
just
uncertain
about
it
in
our
own
minds


that
idea
is
wrong


it
is
not
what
was
talking
about


having
trouble
measuring
something
is
a
problem
but
it
is
not
the
problem
was
talking
about


idea
is
very
hard
to
grasp
but
we
can
make
it
clearer
with
an
example


first
we
will
start
calling
these
grids
matrices
because
we
will
soon
need
to
talk
about
matrix
multiplication


suppose
that
we
start
with
two
kinds
of
measurements
position
q
and
momentum
p


in
wrote
an
equation
like
this
one
y
sum
a
p
q
equation
for
the
conjugate
<collocation>variables momentum</collocation>
and
position
he
did
not
know
it
but
this
equation
gives
a
blueprint
for
writing
out
two
matrices
grids
and
for
multiplying
them


the
rules
for
multiplying
one
matrix
by
another
are
a
little
messy
but
here
are
the
two
matrices
according
to
the
blueprint
and
then
their
product
matrix
of
p
electron
states
n
p
n
p
n
p
n
p
p
p
p
p
p
transition
matrix
of
q
clear
electron
states
q
q
q
q
q
q
q
q
q
transition
the
matrix
for
the
product
of
the
above
two
matrices
as
specified
by
the
relevant
equation
in
paper
is
electron
states
n
a
b
c
where
a
n
q
p
n
q
p
n
q
b
q
p
q
p
q
c
q
p
q
p
q
and
so
forth


note
how
changing
the
order
of
multiplication
changes
the
numbers
step
by
step
that
are
actually
multiplied


beyond
the
work
of
seemed
to
break
a
log
jam


very
soon
many
different
other
ways
of
explaining
things
came
from
people
such
as
louis
de
max
born
paul
and


the
work
of
each
of
these
physicists
is
its
own
story


the
math
used
by
and
earlier
people
is
not
very
hard
to
understand
but
the
equations
quickly
grew
very
complicated
as
physicists
looked
more
deeply
into
the
atomic
world


further
mysteries
in
the
early
days
of
<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
albert
einstein
suggested
that
if
it
were
right
then
<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
would
mean
that
there
would
be
<collocation>spooky action</collocation>
at
a
distance


it
turned
out
that
<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
was
right
and
that
what
einstein
had
used
as
a
reason
to
reject
<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
actually
happened


this
kind
of
spooky
connection
between
certain
quantum
events
is
now
called
<collocation>quantum entanglement</collocation>


two
<collocation>entangled particles</collocation>
are
separated
one
on
earth
and
one
taken
to
some
distant
planet


measuring
one
of
them
forces
it
to
decide
which
role
to
take
and
the
other
one
must
then
take
the
other
role
whenever
after
that
it
is
measured


when
an
experiment
brings
two
things
photons
electrons
together
they
must
then
share
a
common
description
in
<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>


when
they
are
later
separated
they
keep
the
same
quantum
mechanical
description
or
state


in
the
diagram
one
characteristic
up
spin
is
drawn
in
red
and
its
mate
down
spin
is
drawn
in
blue


the
purple
band
means
that
when
two
electrons
are
put
together
the
pair
shares
both
characteristics


so
both
electrons
could
show
either
up
spin
or
down
spin


when
they
are
later
separated
one
remaining
on
earth
and
one
going
to
some
planet
of
the
star
<collocation>alpha centauri</collocation>
they
still
each
have
both
spins


in
other
words
each
one
of
them
can
decide
to
show
itself
as
a
electron
or
a
electron


but
if
later
on
someone
measures
the
other
one
it
must
decide
to
show
itself
as
having
the
opposite
spin


einstein
argued
that
over
such
a
great
distance
it
was
crazy
to
think
that
forcing
one
electron
to
show
its
spin
would
then
somehow
make
the
other
electron
show
an
opposite
characteristic


he
said
that
the
two
electrons
must
have
been
or
all
along
but
that
<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
could
not
predict
which
characteristic
each
electron
had


being
unable
to
predict
only
being
able
to
look
at
one
of
them
with
the
right
experiment
meant
that
<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
could
not
account
for
something
important


therefore
einstein
said
<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
had
a
big
hole
in
it


<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
was
incomplete


later
it
turned
out
that
experiments
showed
that
it
was
einstein
who
was
wrong


the
uncertainty
principle
in
described
the
uncertainty
principle
which
says
that
the
more
we
know
about
where
a
particle
is
the
less
we
can
know
about
how
fast
it
is
going
and
in
which
direction
in
other
words
the
more
we
know
about
the
speed
and
direction
of
something
small
the
less
we
can
know
about
its
position


physicists
usually
talk
about
the
momentum
in
such
discussions
instead
of
talking
about
speed


momentum
is
just
the
speed
of
something
in
a
certain
direction
times
its
mass


the
reason
behind
this
uncertainty
principle
says
that
we
can
never
know
both
the
location
and
the
momentum
of
a
particle


because
light
is
an
abundant
particle
it
is
used
for
measuring
other
particles


the
only
way
to
measure
it
is
to
bounce
the
light
wave
off
of
the
particle
and
record
the
results


if
a
high
energy
or
high
frequency
light
beam
is
used
we
can
tell
precisely
where
it
is
but
can
not
tell
how
fast
it
was
going


this
is
because
the
high
energy
<collocation>photon transfers</collocation>
energy
to
the
particle
and
changes
the
particle
speed


if
we
use
a
low
energy
photon
we
can
tell
how
fast
it
is
going
but
not
where
it
is


this
is
because
we
are
using
light
with
a
longer
wavelength


the
longer
wavelength
means
the
particle
could
be
anywhere
along
the
stretch
of
the
wave


the
principle
also
says
that
there
are
many
pairs
of
things
for
which
we
can
not
know
both
of
them
about
any
particle
a
very
small
thing
no
matter
how
hard
we
try


the
more
we
learn
about
one
of
such
a
pair
the
less
we
can
know
about
the
other


even
albert
einstein
had
trouble
accepting
such
a
<collocation>bizarre concept</collocation>
and
in
a
debate
said
god
does
not
play
dice


to
this
danish
physicist
famously
responded
einstein
do
tell
god
what
to
do


uses
of
<collocation>qm electrons</collocation>
surround
every
atom
nucleus


chemical
bonds
link
atoms
to
form
molecules


a
chemical
bond
links
two
atoms
when
electrons
are
shared
between
those
atoms


thus
qm
is
the
physics
of
the
chemical
bond
and
of
chemistry


qm
helps
us
understand
how
molecules
are
made
and
what
their
properties
are


qm
can
also
help
us
understand
big
things
such
as
stars
and
even
the
whole
universe


qm
is
a
very
important
part
of
the
theory
of
how
the
universe
began
called
the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>


everything
made
of
matter
is
attracted
to
other
matter
because
of
a
fundamental
force
called
gravity


einstein
theory
that
explains
gravity
is
called
the
theory
of
general
relativity


a
problem
in
modern
physics
is
that
some
conclusions
of
qm
do
not
seem
to
agree
with
the
theory
of
general
relativity


qm
is
the
part
of
physics
that
can
explain
why
all
electronic
technology
works
as
it
does


thus
qm
explains
how
computers
work
because
computers
are
electronic
machines


but
the
designers
of
the
early
computer
hardware
of
around
or
did
not
need
to
think
about
qm


the
designers
of
radios
and
televisions
at
that
time
did
not
think
about
qm
either


however
the
design
of
the
more
powerful
<collocation>integrated circuits</collocation>
and
computer
memory
technologies
of
recent
years
does
require
qm


qm
has
also
made
possible
technologies
such
as
spectroscopy
laser
and
why
qm
is
hard
to
learn
qm
is
a
challenging
subject
for
several
reasons
qm
explains
things
in
very
different
ways
from
what
we
learn
about
the
world
when
we
are
children


understanding
qm
requires
more
mathematics
than
algebra
and
simple
calculus


it
also
requires
<collocation>matrix algebra</collocation>
complex
numbers
probability
theory
and
partial
<collocation>differential equations</collocation>


physicists
are
not
sure
what
some
of
the
equations
of
qm
tell
us
about
the
real
world


qm
suggests
that
atoms
and
<collocation>subatomic particles</collocation>
behave
in
strange
ways
completely
unlike
anything
we
see
in
our
everyday
lives


qm
describes
things
that
are
really
really
small
so
we
can
not
see
some
of
them
without
special
equipment
and
we
can
not
see
many
of
them
at
all


qm
describes
nature
in
a
way
that
is
different
from
how
we
usually
think
about
science


it
tells
us
how
likely
to
happen
some
things
are
rather
than
telling
us
that
they
certainly
will
happen


one
example
is
young
experiment


if
we
shoot
single
photons
single
units
of
light
from
a
laser
at
a
sheet
of
<collocation>photographic film</collocation>
we
will
see
a
single
spot
of
light
on
the
developed
film


if
we
put
a
sheet
of
metal
in
between
and
make
two
very
<collocation>narrow slits</collocation>
in
the
sheet
when
we
fire
many
photons
at
the
metal
sheet
and
they
have
to
go
through
the
slits
then
we
will
see
something
remarkable


all
the
way
across
the
sheet
of
developed
film
we
will
see
a
series
of
bright
and
dark
bands


we
can
use
mathematics
to
tell
exactly
where
the
bright
bands
will
be
and
how
bright
the
light
was
that
made
them
that
is
we
can
tell
ahead
of
time
how
many
photons
will
fall
on
each
band


but
if
we
slow
the
process
down
and
see
where
each
photon
lands
on
the
screen
we
can
never
tell
ahead
of
time
where
the
next
one
will
show
up


we
can
know
for
sure
that
it
is
most
likely
that
a
photon
will
hit
the
center
bright
band
and
that
it
gets
less
and
less
likely
that
a
photon
will
show
up
at
bands
farther
and
farther
from
the
center


so
we
know
for
sure
that
the
bands
will
be
brightest
at
the
center
and
get
dimmer
and
dimmer
farther
away


but
we
never
know
for
sure
which
photon
will
go
into
which
band


one
of
the
<collocation>strange conclusions</collocation>
of
qm
theory
is
the
cat
effect


certain
properties
of
a
particle
such
as
their
position
speed
of
motion
direction
of
motion
and
spin
can
not
be
talked
about
until
something
measures
them
a
photon
bouncing
off
of
an
electron
would
count
as
a
measurement
of
its
position
for
example


before
the
measurement
the
particle
is
in
a
superposition
of
states
in
which
its
properties
have
many
values
at
the
same
time


said
that
<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
seemed
to
say
that
if
something
such
as
the
life
or
death
of
a
cat
was
determined
by
a
quantum
event
then
its
state
would
be
determined
by
the
state
that
resulted
from
the
quantum
event
but
only
at
the
time
that
somebody
looked
at
the
state
of
the
quantum
event


in
the
time
before
the
state
of
the
quantum
event
is
looked
at
perhaps
the
living
and
dead
cat
pardon
the
expression
are
mixed
or
smeared
out
in
equal
parts


reduced
constant
people
often
used
the
symbol
which
is
called


is
a
unit
of
angular
momentum


when
this
new
unit
is
used
to
describe
the
orbits
of
electrons
in
atoms
the
angular
momentum
of
any
electron
in
orbit
is
always
a
whole
number


example
the
particle
in
a
well
is
the
most
simple
example
showing
that
the
energy
of
a
particle
can
only
have
specific
values


the
energy
is
said
to
be


the
well
has
zero
potential
energy
inside
a
range
and
has
infinite
potential
energy
everywhere
outside
that
range


for
the
case
in
the
x
direction
the
equation
can
be
written
as
d
psi
e
psi


using
<collocation>differential equations</collocation>
we
can
see
that
psi
must
be

a

b

k
or
psi
c

d
cos
by
formula
the
walls
of
the
box
mean
that
the
must
have
a
special
form


the
of
the
particle
must
be
zero
anytime
the
walls
are
infinitely
tall


at
each
wall
psi
at
x
x
l
consider

sin

to
satisfy
psi
the
cos
term
has
to
be
removed


hence
d
now
consider
psi
c
sin
at
x
l
psi
c
sin
kl
if
c
then
psi
for
all
x


this
solution
is
not
useful


therefore
sin
kl
must
be
true
giving
us
kl
n
pi
n
we
can
see
that
n
must
be
an
integer


this
means
that
the
particle
can
only
have
special
energy
values
and
can
not
have
the
energy
values
in
between


this
is
an
example
of
energy
