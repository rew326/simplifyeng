logical
consistency
is
a
cornerstone
of
any
acceptable
theory


philosophers
who
disagree
with
a
theory
will
often
try
to
find
a
logical
contradiction
within
the
theory


if
they
can
find
one
this
gives
them
a
reason
to
reject
that
theory


if
they
can
not
find
any
inconsistency
the
philosopher
might
try
to
show
that
the
theory
leads
to
a
conclusion
which
is
either
unacceptable
or
ridiculous


this
second
approach
is
usually
called
ad

physics
a
branch
of
science
is
the
study
of
forces
and
their
impacts
on
the
environment


modern
physics
connects
ideas
together
about
the
laws
of
symmetry
and
conservation
energy
momentum
charge
and
parity


the
word
physics
comes
from

what
is
physics


physics
is
the
study
of
energy
and
matter
in
space
and
time
and
how
they
are
related
to
each
other


physicists
assume
the
existence
of
mass
length
time
and
electric
current
and
then
define
give
the
meaning
of
all
other
physical
quantities
in
terms
of
these
basic
units


mass
length
time
and
electric
current
are
never
defined
but
the
standard
units
used
to
measure
them
are
always
defined


in
the
international
system
of
units
<collocation>abbreviated si</collocation>
from
the
french
i
the
metre
is
the
basic
unit
of
length
the
kilogram
is
the
basic
unit
of
mass
the
second
is
the
basic
unit
of
time
the
is
the
basic
unit
of
electric
current


in
addition
to
these
four
units
there
are
three
other
ones
the
mole
which
is
the
unit
of
the
quantity
of
matter
the
candela
which
measures
the
luminous
intensity
the
power
of
lighting
and
the
kelvin
the
unit
of
temperature


physics
studies
how
things
move
and
the
forces
that
make
them
move


for
example
velocity
and
acceleration
are
used
by
physics
to
show
how
things
move


also
physicists
study
the
forces
of
gravity
electricity
magnetism
and
the
forces
that
hold
things
together


physics
studies
very
large
things
and
very
small
things


for
instance
physicists
can
study
stars
planets
and
galaxies
but
could
also
study
small
pieces
of
matter
such
as
atoms
and
electrons


they
may
also
study
sound
light
and
other
waves


as
well
as
that
they
could
examine
energy
heat
and
radioactivity
and
even
space
and
time


physics
not
only
helps
people
understand
how
objects
move
but
how
they
change
form
how
they
make
noise
how
hot
or
cold
they
will
be
and
what
they
are
made
of
at
the
smallest
level


physics
and
mathematics
physics
is
a
quantitative
science
because
it
is
based
on
measuring
with
numbers


maths
is
used
in
physics
to
make
models
that
try
to
guess
what
will
happen
in
nature


the
guesses
are
compared
to
the
way
the
real
world
works


physicists
are
always
working
to
make
their
models
of
the
world
better


advanced
knowledge
general
description
physics
is
the
science
of
matter
and
how
matter
interacts


matter
is
any
physical
material
in
the
universe


everything
is
made
of
matter


physics
is
used
to
describe
the
physical
universe
around
us
and
to
predict
how
it
will
behave


physics
is
the
science
concerned
with
the
discovery
and
characterization
of
the
universal
laws
which
govern
matter
movement
and
forces
and
space
and
time
and
other
features
of
the
natural
world


breadth
and
goals
of
physics
the
sweep
of
physics
is
broad
from
the
smallest
components
of
matter
and
the
forces
that
hold
it
together
to
galaxies
and
even
larger
things


there
are
only
four
forces
that
appear
to
operate
over
this
whole
range


however
even
these
four
forces
gravity
electromagnetism
the
weak
force
associated
with
radioactivity
and
the
strong
force
which
holds
protons
and
neutrons
in
an
atom
together
are
believed
to
be
different
parts
of
a
single
force


physics
is
mainly
focused
on
the
goal
of
making
ever
simpler
more
general
and
more
accurate
rules
that
define
the
character
and
behavior
of
matter
and
space
itself


one
of
the
major
goals
of
physics
is
making
theories
that
apply
to
everything
in
the
universe


in
other
words
physics
can
be
viewed
as
the
study
of
those
universal
laws
which
define
at
the
most
basic
level
possible
the
behavior
of
the
physical
universe


physics
uses
the
scientific
method
physics
uses
the
scientific
method


that
is
data
from
experiments
and
observations
are
collected


theories
which
attempt
to
explain
these
data
are
produced


physics
uses
these
theories
to
not
only
describe
physical
phenomena
but
to
model
physical
systems
and
predict
how
these
physical
systems
will
behave


physicists
then
compare
these
predictions
to
observations
or
experimental
evidence
to
show
whether
the
theory
is
right
or
wrong


the
theories
that
are
well
supported
by
data
and
are
especially
simple
and
general
are
sometimes
called
scientific
laws


of
course
all
theories
including
those
known
as
laws
can
be
replaced
by
more
accurate
and
more
general
laws
when
a
disagreement
with
data
is
found


physics
is
<collocation>quantitative physics</collocation>
is
more
quantitative
than
most
other
sciences


that
is
many
of
the
observations
in
physics
may
be
represented
in
the
form
of
<collocation>numerical measurements</collocation>


most
of
the
theories
in
physics
use
mathematics
to
express
their
principles


most
of
the
predictions
from
these
theories
are
numerical


this
is
because
of
the
areas
which
physics
has
addressed
are
more
amenable
to
quantitative
approaches
than
other
areas


sciences
also
tend
to
become
more
quantitative
with
time
as
they
become
more
highly
developed
and
physics
is
one
of
the
oldest
sciences


fields
of
physics
classical
physics
normally
includes
the
fields
of
mechanics
optics
electricity
magnetism
acoustics
and
thermodynamics


modern
physics
is
a
term
normally
used
to
cover
fields
which
rely
on
<collocation>quantum theory</collocation>
including
<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
atomic
physics
nuclear
physics
particle
physics
and
<collocation>condensed matter</collocation>
physics
as
well
as
the
more
modern
fields
of
general
and
special
relativity


although
this
distinction
can
be
found
in
older
writings
it
is
of
little
recent
interest
as
quantum
effects
are
now
understood
to
be
of
importance
even
in
fields
previously
considered
classical


approaches
in
physics
there
are
many
approaches
to
studying
physics
and
many
different
kinds
of
activities
in
physics


there
are
two
main
types
of
activities
in
physics
the
collection
of
data
and
the
development
of
theories


the
data
in
some
of
physics
is
amenable
to
experiment


for
example
<collocation>condensed matter</collocation>
physics
and
nuclear
physics
benefit
from
the
ability
to
perform
experiments


experimental
physics
focuses
mainly
on
an
<collocation>empirical approach</collocation>


sometimes
experiments
are
done
to
explore
nature
and
in
other
cases
experiments
are
performed
to
produce
data
to
compare
with
the
predictions
of
theories


some
other
fields
in
physics
like
astrophysics
and
geophysics
are
primarily
<collocation>observational sciences</collocation>
because
most
their
data
has
to
be
collected
passively
instead
of
through
experimentation


nevertheless
observational
programs
in
these
fields
uses
many
of
the
same
tools
and
technology
that
are
used
in
the
experimental
of
physics


theoretical
physics
often
uses
quantitative
approaches
to
develop
the
theories
that
attempt
to
explain
the
data


in
this
way
theoretical
physics
often
relies
heavily
on
tools
from
mathematics


theoretical
physics
often
can
involve
creating
<collocation>quantitative predictions</collocation>
of
physical
theories
and
comparing
these
predictions
with
data


theoretical
physics
sometimes
creates
models
of
physical
systems
before
data
is
available
to
test
and
validate
these
models


there
are
many
significant
uses
of
physics
like
measuring
houses
or
any
measure


also
it
can
be
used
to
measure
falling
objects
like
planes


these
two
main
activities
in
physics
data
collection
and
theory
production
and
testing
draw
on
many
different
skills


this
has
led
to
a
lot
of
specialization
in
physics
and
the
introduction
development
and
use
of
tools
from
other
fields


for
example
<collocation>theoretical physicists</collocation>
apply
mathematics
and
<collocation>numerical analysis</collocation>
and
statistics
and
probability
and
computer
software
in
their
work


<collocation>experimental physicists</collocation>
develop
instruments
and
techniques
for
collecting
data
drawing
on
engineering
and
computer
technology
and
many
other
fields
of
technology


often
the
tools
from
these
other
areas
are
not
quite
appropriate
for
the
needs
of
physics
and
need
to
be
adapted
or
more
advanced
versions
have
to
be
produced


physicists
there
are
many
famous
physicists


<collocation>isaac newton</collocation>
studied
gravity


galileo
galilei
studied
light
and
how
planets
moved


albert
einstein
made
a
theory
for
how
light
can
make
electrons
move
and
studied
how
gravity
affects
light
and
space


james
clerk
maxwell
proved
that
light
is
a
type
of
electromagnetic
wave


<collocation>ernest rutherford</collocation>
stated
that
physics
is
the
only
real
science


the
rest
are
just
stamp
collecting

politics
is
the
way
that
people
living
in
groups
make
decisions


politics
is
about
making
agreements
between
people
so
that
they
can
live
together
in
groups
such
as
tribes
cities
or
countries


in
large
groups
such
as
countries
some
people
may
spend
a
lot
of
their
time
making
such
agreements


these
people
are
called
politicians


politicians
and
sometimes
other
people
may
get
together
to
form
a
government


the
study
of
politics
in
universities
is
called
political
science
political
studies
or
public
administration


in
everyday
life
the
term
politics
refers
to
the
way
that
countries
are
governed
and
to
the
ways
that
governments
make
rules
and
laws


but
politics
can
also
be
seen
in
other
groups
too
such
as
in
big
companies
schools
and
churches

governments
the
government
tries
to
lead
the
whole
group


governments
do
things
such
as
decide
which
people
get
which
pieces
of
land
decide
which
people
can
tell
other
people
what
to
do
decide
whether
to
go
to
war
with
another
country
create
money
build
things
for
the
use
of
the
whole
group
such
as
roads
hospitals
libraries
and
docks


educate
people
either
for
their
own
good
or
to
teach
them
what
the
government
wants
them
to
know
take
care
of
the
very
young
the
sick
or
the
very
old
manage
the
welfare
of
the
country
and
manages
the
money
available
for
spending
on
services
hospitals
schools
one
of
the
ways
the
government
leads
the
group
is
by
making
laws
and
rules
which
tell
everybody
what
they
can
and
can
not
do


the
government
makes
these
laws
so
that
society
will
be
safe
and


the
law
that
you
must
not
drink
alcohol
while
driving
a
car
stops
people
from
drunk
driving
which
could
kill
people


the
law
you
must
wear
a
helmet
on
a
motorcycle
makes
sure
that
people
protect
themselves


the
government
can
also
control
people
and
what
happens
in
a
country
in
other
ways
besides
making
laws


for
example
how
the
government
spends
its
money
makes
a
big
difference
in
what
people
will
do
or
what
will
happen
to
people


if
the
government
spends
a
lot
of
money
on
hospitals
and
nurses
the
people
will
probably
become
healthier


also
if
people
like
their
government
or
think
that
their
government
is
wise
they
may
do
something
just
because
their
government
says
it
is
a
good
thing
to
do


governments
often
make
posters
or
television
advertisements
that
encourage
people
to
stop
smoking
cigarettes
or
eat
more
fruits
and
vegetables


politics
is
often
compared
to
ethics
ideas
about
right
and
wrong


ethics
is
a
more
abstract
study
of
right
and
wrong


ethics
is
usually
more
concerned
with
principle
than
law
or
politics
or
diplomacy
so
many
people
think
ethics
is
not
practical


but
without
some
agreement
on
ethics
there
is
probably
no
way
to
even
have
a
debate
laws
or
an
election


there
is
always
some
agreement
on
ethics
and
personal
conduct
in
a
political
system


political
parties
in
most
countries
people
have
formed
political
parties
to
put
forward
their
ideas


there
is
usually
some
disagreement
between
people
within
a
party
but
they
work
together
because
they
feel
that
they
agree
on
enough
things
and
they
will
have
more
power
if
they
join
together


they
agree
to
take
the
same
position
on
many
issues
and
agree
to
support
the
same
changes
to
law
and
the
same
leaders


an
election
is
usually
a
competition
between
different
parties


history
the
greek
philosopher
aristotle
wrote
that
humans
are
a
political
animal
and
that
ethics
and
politics
are
closely
linked


niccolo
wrote
that
politics
was
firstly
about
having
and
keeping
power


he
said
that
without
power
a
leader
could
do
nothing


in
thomas
wrote
leviathan
a
book
about
politics


wrote
that
people
living
in
groups
often
give
up
some
of
their
rights
in
exchange
for
some
protections
from
a
government


in
the
john
<collocation>stuart mill</collocation>
developed
the
liberal
idea
of
politics


mill
said
that
democracy
is
the
most
important
political
development
of
the


he
said
that
there
should
be
more
protection
for
individual
rights
against
the
government


bernard
crick
wrote
a
list
of
the
political
virtues
which
were
about
best
practices
of
politics
itself


international
politics
there
are
also
disagreements
between
different
countries


attempts
to
solve
the
problem
with
meetings
are
called
diplomacy


this
is
politics
between
nations
instead
of
politics
within
nations


if
the
problems
are
not
resolved
by
diplomatic
meetings
they
can
lead
to
war
or
terrorism

that
can
be

to
apply
in

applied
by
choice

on
the
order
in
which
they
are

that
is

a
drawing
of
profanity
replaced
by
symbols
profanity
is
the
act
of
using
swears


the
adjective
is
profane


profanities
can
also
be
called
swear
words
curse
cuss
words
dirty
words
bad
words
foul
language
obscenity
obscene
language
or
expletives


it
can
be
called
an
oath
although
this
word
also
has
a
normal
meaning
of
a
solemn
promise


religious
profanity
is
called
blasphemy


the
verb
is
to
blaspheme
and
the
adjective
is
blasphemous


saying
god


or
<collocation>jesus christ</collocation>


as
an
expression
of
surprise
or
annoyance
is
considered
by
many
people
to
be
blasphemy
mostly
because
one
of
the
ten
commandments
says
not
to
use
god
name
in
vain
without
substance
or
without
intended
relevance


swearing
oaths
can
also
be
considered
wrong
by
some
who
follow
jesus
teaching
against
swearing
oaths
in
the
gospels
such
as
matthew


a
profanity
usually
refers
to
religion
sex
or
<collocation>bodily functions</collocation>


these
are
things
that
people
feel
very
strongly
about


in
some
languages
such
as
french
there
is
more
profanity
about
religion
than
most
other
topics


a
profanity
can
be
a
word
or
gesture
or
some
other
form
of
behavior


different
words
can
be
profanity
to
different
people
and
what
words
are
thought
of
as
profanity
in
english
can
change
over
time


whether
a
word
is
a
profanity
will
always
depend
on
the
way
people
think


some
people
will
be
offended
by
something
while
others
will
not
be


words
which
should
not
be
used
are
taboo
words


using
such
words
is
