bell
genius
is
seen
in
part
by
the
eighteen
patents
granted
in
his
name
alone
and
the
twelve
that
he
shared
with
others


these
included
fifteen
for
the
telephone
and
telegraph
four
for
the
one
for
the
phonograph
five
for
aerial
vehicles
four
for
and
two
for
a
selenium
cell


in
he
was
one
of
the
original
members
of
the
national
<collocation>geographic society</collocation>
and
became
its
second
president


he
was
given
many
honors


the
french
government
gave
him
the
decoration
of
the
legion
of
honor


the
royal
society
of
arts
in
london
awarded
him
the
albert
medal
in


the
university
of
granted
him
the
degree
of


telephone
his
past
experience
made
him
ready
to
work
more
with
sound
and
electricity


he
began
his
studies
in
with
a
musical
telegraph
in
which
he
used
an
electric
circuit
and
a
magnet
to
make
an
iron
reed
or
tongue
vibrate


one
day
it
was
found
that
a
reed
failed
to
respond
to
the
current


bell
desired
his
assistant
who
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
to
pluck
the
reed
thinking
it
had
stuck
to
the
magnet


his
assistant
thomas
watson
complied
and
to
his
surprise
bell
heard
the
corresponding
reed
at
his
end
of
the
line
vibrate
and
sound
the
same
without
any
electric
current
to
power
it


a
few
experiments
soon
showed
that
his
reed
had
been
set
in
vibration
by
the
changes
in
the
magnetic
field
that
the
moving
reed
produced
in
the
line


this
discovery
led
him
to
stop
using
the
electric
battery
current


his
idea
was
that
since
the
circuit
was
never
broken
all
the
complex
vibrations
of
speech
might
be
converted
into
currents
which
in
turn
would
reproduce
the
speech
at
a
distance


bell
with
his
assistant
devised
a
receiver
consisting
of
a
stretched
film
or
drum
with
a
bit
of
magnetised
iron
attached
to
its
middle
and
free
to
vibrate
in
front
of
the
pole
of
an
electromagnet
in
circuit
with
the
line


this
apparatus
was
completed
on
june


on
july
he
instructed
his
assistant
to
make
a
second
receiver
which
could
be
used
with
the
first
and
a
few
days
later
they
were
tried
together
at
each
end
of
the
line
which
ran
from
a
room
in
the
inventor
house
at
boston
to
the
cellar
underneath


bell
in
the
room
held
one
instrument
in
his
hands
while
watson
in
the
cellar
listened
at
the
other


the
inventor
spoke
into
his
instrument
do
you
understand
what
i
say


and
watson
rushed
back
into
the
upstairs
and
answered
yes


the
first
successful
telephone
call
was
not
made
until
march
when
bell
spoke
into
his
device
watson
come
here
i
want
to
see
you


and
watson
answered
back
and
came
into
the
room
to
see
bell


the
first
long
distance
telephone
call
was
made
on
august
by
bell
from
the
family
home
in
ontario
to
his
assistant
in
paris
ontario
some
km
mi


on
march
the
patent
office
gave
him
patent
for
the
telephone


metal
detector
bell
is
also
credited
with
the
invention
of
an
improved
metal
detector
in
that
made
sounds
when
it
was
near
metal


the
device
was
quickly
put
together
in
an
attempt
to
find
the
bullet
in
the
body
of
president
james
garfield


the
metal
detector
worked
but
did
not
find
the
bullet
because
of
the
metal
the
president
was
lying
on


bell
gave
a
full
description
of
his
experiments
in
a
paper
read
before
the
american
association
for
the
advancement
of
science
in
august


eugenics
bell
was
an
active
supporter
of
the
eugenics
movement
in
the
united
states


he
was
the
honorary
president
of
the
second
international
congress
of
eugenics
held
at
the
american
museum
of
natural
history
in
<collocation>new york</collocation>
in


he
did
not
want
deaf
people
to
be
allowed
to
teach
in
schools
for
the
deaf


he
was
also
against
the
use
of
<collocation>sign language</collocation>


these
things
mean
that
he
is
not
appreciated
by
some
deaf
people
in
the
present
day

and
cyprus
but
there
are
also
people
in
other
countries
around
the
world
who
speak
the
language


this

largely
because
