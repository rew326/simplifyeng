stars
spend
most
of
their
lives
burning
fusing
hydrogen
to
make
energy


when
hydrogen
is
fused
it
makes
helium


to
fuse
hydrogen
it
must
be
very
very
hot
and
the
pressure
must
be
very
very
high


fusion
happens
at
the
center
of
stars


the
center
part
of
the
star
is
called
the
core


the
smallest
stars
called
red
dwarfs
fuse
their
hydrogen
very
slowly
and
live
for
billion
years


red
dwarfs
live
longer
than
any
other
type
of
star


at
the
end
of
their
lives
they
become
dimmer
and
dimmer


red
dwarfs
do
not
explode


when
very
heavy
stars
die
they
explode


this
is
called
a
supernova


when
a
supernova
happens
in
a
nebula
the
explosion
pushes
the
gas
in
the
nebula
together


this
makes
the
gas
in
the
nebula
very
thick


gravity
and
exploding
stars
both
help
to
make
new
stars
in


most
stars
use
up
the
hydrogen
at
their
core


when
they
do
their
core
shrinks
and
becomes
very
very
hot


it
becomes
so
hot
it
pushes
away
the
outer
layer
of
the
star


as
the
outer
layer
expands
it
makes
a
red
giant
star


think
that
in
about
billion
years
the
sun
will
be
a
red
giant


our
sun
will
be
so
large
it
will
eat
the
earth


after
our
sun
stops
using
hydrogen
to
make
energy
it
will
use
helium
in
its
very
hot
core


it
will
be
hotter
than
when
it
was
<collocation>fusing hydrogen</collocation>


heavy
stars
will
also
make
elements
heavier
than
helium


as
a
star
makes
heavier
and
heavier
elements
it
makes
less
and
less
energy


elements
as
heavy
as
iron
are
made
in
heavy
stars


average
stars
like
our
sun
will
push
away
their
outer
gases


the
gas
it
pushes
away
makes
a
cloud
called
a
<collocation>planetary nebula</collocation>


the
core
part
of
the
star
will
remain


it
will
be
a
ball
as
big
as
the
earth
and
called
a
white
dwarf


it
will
fade
into
a
black
dwarf
over
a
very
very
long
time


in
heavier
stars
heavier
and
heavier
elements
are
made
by
fusion


finally
the
star
makes
a
supernova
explosion


most
things
happen
in
the
universe
so
slowly
we
do
not
notice


but
<collocation>supernova explosions</collocation>
happen
in
only
seconds


when
a
supernovae
explodes
it
flash
is
as
bright
as
a
billion
stars


the
dying
star
is
so
bright
it
can
be
seen
during
the
day


supernova
means
new
star
because
people
used
to
think
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
new
star


today
we
know
that
a
supernova
is
the
death
of
an
old
star


the
gas
of
the
star
is
pushed
away
by
the
explosion


it
forms
a
giant
cloud
of
gas
called
a
planetary
nebulae


the
crab
nebula
is
a
good
example


all
that
remains
is
a
neutron
star


if
the
star
was
very
heavy
the
star
will
make
a
black
hole
in
the
universe


gravity
in
a
black
hole
is
very
very
strong


it
is
so
strong
not
even
light
can
escape
from
a
black
hole


the
heaviest
elements
are
made
in
the
explosion
of
a
supernova


after
billions
of
years
of
floating
in
space
the
gas
and
dust
come
together
to
make
new
stars
and
new
planets


the
gas
and
dust
in
space
comes
mostly
from
supernovae


our
sun
the
earth
and
all
living
things
are
made
from
star
dust

driving
in

is
the
act

drunk
driving
is
illegal
in
most
areas

in

places
driving
a
vehicle
such
as
a
bicycle
while
drunk
is
also
illegal


most
areas
that
make
laws

started
with
driving
while
intoxicated
laws
banning
just
alcohol


later
most
changed
them
to
dui
driving
under

laws
adding
other
drugs
to
those
banned
while
driving


the
most

in

the
legal

history
of
drunk
driving
laws
the
first
place
in
the
united
states
to
adopt
laws
against
drunk
driving
was
the
state
of
<collocation>new york</collocation>
in
with
california
and
others
doing
the
same
later


early
laws
simply
banned
driving
while
drunk
with
no
mention
of
what
bac
was
banned
which
means
how
drunk
the
person
is


the
state
of
georgia
was
one
of
the
last
states
to
make
laws
against
drunk
driving


one
of
the
years
with
the
most
alcohol
related
crashes
was


the
year
had
alcohol
related
deaths
due
to
drunk
driving


in
the
us
most
of
the
laws
were
greatly
tightened
in
the
early
largely
due
to
pressure
from
groups
like
mothers
against
drunk
drivers
and
young
adults
educating
responsible
drinking

tags
uses
special
bits
of
programming
language
called
tags
to
let
the
browser
know
how
a
webpage
should
look


the
tags
usually
come
in
pairs
an
opening
tag
to
tell
the
browser
when
to
start
doing
something
and
an
ending
tag
to
tell
the
browser
when
to
stop
doing
something


there
are
many
different
kinds
of
tags
and
each
one
has
a
different
purpose


<collocation>opening tags</collocation>
have
a
keyword
such
as
p
surrounded
by
<collocation>angle brackets</collocation>
and


for
example
the
tag
tells
the
browser
the
start
a
new

ending
tags
look
almost
exactly
the
same
only
they
have
a
forward
slash
added
just
before
the
keyword


for
example
the
tag
tells
the
browser
to
end
a

a
small
number
of
tags
like
and
can
be
used
without
an
ending
tag


some
tags
only
work
in
certain
browsers


for
example
the
tag
which
is
used
to
make
a
bit
of
writing
slide
across
the
page
only
works
in
the
<collocation>internet explorer</collocation>
and
browsers


other
browsers
simply
ignore
this
tag
and
display
the
writing
normally


many
web
page
creators
avoid
using
these
tags
because
they
want
their
pages
to
look
the
same
with
all
browsers


example
here
is
an
example
page
in
this
is
the
title

this
is
a

the

things
like

to

years


some
of
the
new
features
in
are
the
tag
which
can
be
used
with
to
draw
pictures
and
animations


a
tag
for
adding
videos
to
a
webpage


a
tag
for
adding
audio
like
music
or
sound
effects
to
a
webpage


for
example
the
tag
which
is
used
to
change
how
text
looks
on
a
page
is
not
available
in


the
recommends
doing
this
with
cascading
style
sheets
instead


one
of
the
aims
of
is
to
remove
the
need
to
use
software
like
adobe
flash
because
it
is
often
slow
on
mobile
devices
like
phones
and
can
be
used
to
infect
your
computer
with
viruses


another
aim
is
to
reduce
the
amount
of
program
code
running
in
each
webpage
thus
making
the
web
faster


currently
no
browsers
completely
support
all
of

however
some
of
the
features
are
supported
by
google

apple
