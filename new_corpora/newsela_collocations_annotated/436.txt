the

is
the
name

a

this
was
a
car


it
was
made
between
and
after
the
company
stopped
the
production
of
peugeot


after
this
the
company
made
a

named

the
peugeot
is
the
name
of
a
car
that
started
being
made

and
stopped

it
was

the

an
and
a

the

following

later

at

the

also
came

is
a
large
new
town
in
ceremonial
england


people
began
to
build

milton
looks
strange
to
people
from
other
towns


aeroplanes
flying
over
ordinary
towns
can
see
roads
that
look
like
a
spider
web


but
when
they
fly
over
the
city
they
see
that
its
big
roads
look
like
a
net
or
a
grid


the
people
who
live
in
milton
call
the
spaces
between
the
busy
roads
grid
squares
and
that
is
where
they
live


<collocation>nobody lives</collocation>
right
next
to
the
big
roads
so
there
are
no
trucks
going
past
the
front
door
of
people
who
live
there


so
really
milton
often
seems
more
like
a
little
villages
than
a
big
city


people
do
not
have
to
cross
a
busy
road
to
get
from
one
grid
square
to
the
next
one
because
the
roads
go
over
bridges
and
people
can
cross
safely
under
them


the
paths
that
go
under
the
roads
and
between
the
houses
are
called
because
they
are
red
in
color


only
people
on
bicycles
and
people
walking
are
allowed
to
use
them


cars
lorries
and
motorbikes
are
not
allowed
to
go
on
them


so
people
could
cycle
all
the
way
across
the
city
and
never
have
to
go
on
a
busy
road

what
was
it
like
before
the
builders
came


the
windmill
near
village
beside
the
playing
fields
before
the
builders
came
there
were
many
fields
and
a
lot
of
villages


people
can
still
see
the
old
villages
because
the
houses
look
different


there
are
many
rivers
and
streams
and
lakes
and
a
canal


there
are
no
houses
on
the
fields
beside
the
rivers


nobody
can
build
on
these
fields
because
sometimes
they
get
flooded
when
it
rains
a
lot


but
nearly
all
the
time
they
are
just
giant
long
parks
called
linear
parks


when
the
builders
dug
up
the
ground
to
build
on
they
found
some
strange
things


the
oldest
was
the
fossil
of
a
dinosaur
fish
called
an


they
also
found
a
roman
farm
people
can
still
see
bits
of
it
because
they
decided
to
leave
it
alone


they
also
found
some
buried
treasure
the
milton
hoard
which
is
now
in
the
british
museum
with
copies
in
the
milton
museum


what
is
there
to
do


there
is
one
big
theater
and
four
small
ones


there
are
only
two
cinemas
but
each
one
has
ten
sections
so
there
are
twenty
movies
on
at
a
time


there
is
a
ski
slope
with
real
snow
even
in
summer


that
is
because
it
is
indoors
with
a
giant
fridge
to
keep
it
cold


there
are
four
big
swimming
pools


at
the
national
bowl
people
can
see
their
favorite
bands
and
artists


not
very
far
away
at
they
see
formula
motor
racing


there
is
a
football
stadium
where
they
can

the
local
football
club
milton

play


they
can

going

road
system
and
roundabouts
the
road
system
in
milton
is
based
on
the
idea
of
major
roads
between
districts
and
minor
roads
within
them


the
major
roads
often
dual
run
almost
all
the
way
across
the
city
but
the
minor
roads
are
just
for
local
use


most
of
the
major
roads
have
a
national
speed
limit
mph
for
single
and
for
dual
thus
traffic
passing
through
milton
can
cross
from
one
side
to
the
other
in
a
relatively
short
time


the
major
roads
run
either
or
though
not
in
straight
lines


this
network
is
called
a
grid
the
major
roads
are
called
grid
roads


roundabouts
are
used
at
the
of
the
grid
traffic
lights
are
rare


public
transport
the
original
design
for
milton
expected
bus
services
to
use
the
grid
roads
with
passengers
walking
to
the
nearest
edge


in
reality
the
bus
services
use
the
internal
minor
roads


concrete
cows
concrete
cows
the
concrete
cows
are
an
art
installation
by
the
american
artist
elizabeth


the
artist
was
working
with
local
children
to
use
found
objects
to
create
art


the
concrete
and
came
as
from
local
building
sites


people
from
outside
notably
a
radio
one
disc
jockey
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
they
symbolised
concrete
cows
for
concrete
fields
failing
to
recognize
how
green
milton
is
and
that
real
cows
and
sheep
graze
the
linear
parks


the
cows
in
the
field
to
the
north
of
<collocation>monks way</collocation>
near
the
junction
with
erica
road
are
a
copy


the
original
set
is
in
the
shopping
center
in
central
milton


the
copy
cows
are
regularly
the
subject
of
vandalism
some
more
creative
than
others
in
the
cows
were
all
painted
to
appear
as
skeletons
by
a
local
guerrilla
artist
in
readiness
for
halloween


this
effort
was
more
artistic
than
most
and
generally
well
received
with
many
people
voicing
a
wish
in
the
<collocation>local newspaper</collocation>
that
the
council
not
repaint
them
but
this
has
been
done


where
is
it


it
is
in
england


it
is
about
half
way
between
oxford
and
cambridge


it
is
about
half
way
between
london
and
birmingham


they
can
get
here
on
the
train
because
we
have
five
railway
stations
the
biggest
one
is
milton
central


they
can
come
on
the
motorway
get
off
at
junction


it
takes
less
than
an
hour
to
get
here
in
the
train
from
london
maybe
half
an
hour
if
they
take
an
express
train
