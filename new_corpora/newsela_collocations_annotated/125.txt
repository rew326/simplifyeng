learned
how
to

called

there
are
four
common
states
or
phases
of

in

solid
liquid
gas
and

malleability

common
states
of
matter
solids
main
solid
in
a
solid
the
positions
of
atoms
are
fixed
relative
to
each
other
over
long
time


that
is
due
to
the
cohesion
or
friction
between
molecules


this
cohesion
is
provided
by
metallic
covalent
or
<collocation>ionic bonds</collocation>


only
solids
can
be
pushed
on
by
a
force
without
changing
shape
which
means
that
they
can
be
resistant
to
deformation


solids
also
tend
to
be
strong
enough
to
hold
their
own
shape
in
a
container


solids
are
generally
denser
than
liquids


liquids
main
liquid
in
a
liquid
molecules
are
attracted
to
other
molecules
strong
enough
to
keep
molecules
in
contact
but
not
strong
enough
to
fix
a
particular
structure


the
molecules
can
continually
move
with
respect
to
each
other


this
means
that
liquids
can
flow
smoothly
but
not
as
smoothly
as
gases


liquids
will
tend
to
take
the
shape
of
a
container
that
they
are
in


liquids
are
generally
less
dense
than
solids
but
denser
than
gases


gases
main
gas
in
a
gas
the
chemical
bonds
are
not
strong
enough
to
hold
atoms
or
molecules
together
and
from
this
a
gas
is
a
collection
of
independent
molecules
which
interact
mainly
by
collision


gases
tend
to
take
the
shape
of
their
container
and
are
less
dense
than
both
solids
and
liquids


gases
have
smaller
forces
of
attraction
than
solids
and
liquids


main
plasma
physics
are
gases
that
have
so
much
energy
that
electrons
of
an
atom
can
not
stay
in
orbit
around
one
atomic
nucleus


the
atomic
ions
and
free
electrons
mix
around
like
a
hot
soup


because
the
positive
and
negative
charged
particles
are
not
stuck
together
plasma
is
a
good
conductor
of
electricity


for
example
air
is
not
good
at
conducting
electricity


however
in
a
bolt
of
lightning
the
atoms
in
air
get
so
much
energy
that
they
no
longer
can
hold
on
to
their
electrons
and
become
a
plasma
for
a
brief
time


then
an
electric
current
is
able
to
flow
through
the
plasma
making
the
lightning


plasma
is
the
most
common
state
of
matter
in
the
universe


both
stars
and
the
<collocation>interstellar medium</collocation>
are
mostly
made
of
plasma


<collocation>phase changes</collocation>
phases
of
matter
can
be
changed
by
a
number
of
things


this
includes
pressure
and
temperature


when
a
solid
becomes
a
liquid
it
is
called
melting


when
a
solid
becomes
a
gas
it
is
called
sublimation


when
a
liquid
becomes
a
gas
it
is
called
vaporization


when
a
gas
becomes
a
liquid
it
is
called
condensation


when
a
liquid
becomes
a
solid
it
is
called
freezing


the
freezing
point
and
the
melting
point
are
said
to
be
the
same
because
any
increase
in
temperature
will
cause
it
to
melt
and
any
drop
in
temperature
will
cause
it
to
freeze


this
is
also
the
reason
that
the
vaporizing
and
condensation
point
are
the
same


other
states
many
other
states
of
matter
can
exist
under
special
conditions
including
strange
matter
and
and
possibly
liquids

about
phases

are
a
relatively
newly

phase
of

happen
at

are

the
same

only

same

condensates
and
condensates
occur
at
incredibly
low
temperatures
about
kelvin
which
is
the
same
as

little
is
known
about
either
state
because
of
the
sheer
amount
of
energy
needed
to
be
taken
away
to
create
them


inside
of
them
all
of
the

to

metal
is
a

of

metal
to
lose
an
electron
and
become
positive
ions
or


in
this
way
metals
are
not

we
can

the

elements
that
are
above
and
to
the
right
of
this
line
are
the


the
rest
of
the
elements
are
the
metals


most
of
the
properties
of
metals
are
due
to
the
fact
that
the
atoms
in
the
metal
do
not
hold
onto
their
electrons
very
tightly


each
atom
is
separated
from
the
others
by
a
thin
layer
of
electrons


however
some
metals
are
different


an
example
is
the
metal
sodium


it
is
soft
melts
at
a
low
temperature
and
is
so
light
it
floats
on
water


people
should
not
try
this
though
because
another
property
of
sodium
is
that
it
explodes
when
it
touches
water


most
metals
are
chemically
stable
and
do
not
react
easily


some
of
the
metals
do

these
are
the
alkali
metals
like

metals


compounds
which
have
metal
atoms
combined
with

are
probably
the

metals
in
history
a
lump
of
pure
copper
found
as
native
copper
the
use
of
metals
is
said
to
be
the
thing
that
makes
people
different
from
animals


before
they
used
metals
people
made
tools
from
stones
wood
and
animal
bones


this
is
now
called
the
stone
age


knows
when
the
first
metal
was
found
and
used


it
was
probably
what
is
called
native
copper
which
is
sometimes
found
in
large
lumps
on
the
ground


people
learned
to
make
this
into
copper
tools
and
other
things
although
for
a
metal
it
is
quite
soft


when
it
was
melted
over
fire
people
learned
how
to
make
an
alloy
called
bronze
which
is
much
harder
and
stronger
than
copper


people
made
knives
and
weapons
from
bronze


this
time
in
human
history
after
about
is
often
called
the
<collocation>bronze age</collocation>
that
is
the
time
of
bronze
tools
and
weapons


around
the
year
some
people
learned
to
make
iron
tools
and
weapons


these
were
even
harder
and
stronger
than
bronze
and
this
was
an
advantage
in
war


the
time
of
iron
tools
and
weapons
is
now
called
the
iron
age


metals
have
been
very
important
in
human
history
and
civilization


iron
and
steel
were
important
in
the
making
of
machines


gold
and
silver
were
used
as
money
in
order
to
allow
people
to
trade
that
is
exchange
goods
and
services
over
long
distances


many
people
thought
that
finding
metals
was
a
way
to
get
rich


there
have
been
many
times
when
gold
was
found
and
people
moved
quickly
in
large
numbers
to
those
places
for
example
central
and
south
america
after
the
year
and
many
places
after
the
year
the
united
states
of
america
canada
australia
new
zealand
and
south
africa


these
are
often
called
gold
rushes


metals
in
astronomy
in
astronomy
a
metal
is
any
element
other
than
hydrogen
or
helium


this
is
because
these
two
elements
and
sometimes
lithium
are
the
only
ones
that
form
outside
stars


in
the
sky
a
telescope
can
see
the
signs
of
metals
and
then
the
astronomer
knows
that
there
are
stars
