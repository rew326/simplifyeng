review


was
developed
by
francis
robinson

students
learn
to
survey
the
reading
materials
not
by
reading
every
word
but
by
getting
an
overall
sense

it
is
about


the
next
step

look

read

next
recite

skim
reading
is
a
technique
to
gain
the
most
from
reading
something
in

least
amount

it
is
looking
at
chapter
headings
bullet
lists
of
key
points
in
and
key
words
in
sentences


the
first
sentence
of
a
chapter
often
is
a
abstract
abstract
of
the
chapter


scanning
involves
moving
your
finger
down
the
page
as
you
read


the
object
is
to
try
to
absorb
at
least
of
the
text


it
is
then
compared
