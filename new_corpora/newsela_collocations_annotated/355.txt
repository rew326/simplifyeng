butterfly
watching
is
a
popular
hobby


some
people
also
keep
collections
of
dead
butterflies
that
they
have
caught


like
all
insects
with
<collocation>complete metamorphosis</collocation>
a
butterfly
life
goes
through
four
distinct
stages


it
begins
as
an
egg
which
hatches
into
a
larva
a
caterpillar


after
some
time
the
larva
turns
into
a
chrysalis
like
a
cocoon


while
it
is
in
the
chrysalis
it
becomes
a
butterfly


the
butterfly
then
hatches
out
and
lays
more
eggs

predators
and
defences
predators
the
main
predators
of
butterflies
are
birds
just
as
the
main
predators
of
the
crepuscular
moths
are
bats


also
monkeys
and
reptiles
are
predators
and
some
insects
and
spiders


certainly
all
reptiles
and
monkeys
have
good
color
vision
so
that
<collocation>butterfly colouration</collocation>
works
just
as
well
on
them
as
it
does
on
birds


defences
the
extraordinary
colors
and
patterns
on
the
wings
and
body
can
only
be
understood
in
terms
of
their
function


some
of
the
most
obvious
functions
of
color
are
camouflage
enabling
the
insect
to
remain
hidden
from
<collocation>view signalling</collocation>
to
other
animals
warning
colouration
signalling
to
other
animals
not
to
<collocation>attack mimicry</collocation>
taking
advantage
of
another
species
warning
coloration
sexual
selection
finding
a
mate
other
kinds
of
signalling
diversion
startle
defense
unexpected
flashes
of
color
or
the
details
vary
from
group
to
group
and
from
species
to
species


the
caterpillars
also
have
colors
with
similar
functions


the
poisonous
substances
which
make
some
butterflies
noxious
to
eat
are
derived
from
the
plants
eaten
by
their
caterpillars


body
the
head
of
a
butterfly


like
most
insects
butterflies
have
three
main
body
parts


these
parts
are
the
head
the
thorax
and
the
abdomen


the
body
is
protected
by
the
exoskeleton


the
body
is
made
up
of
sections
known
as
segments


in
between
the
segments
there
are
flexible
areas
that
allow
the
butterfly
to
move


all
three
parts
of
the
body
are
covered
in
very
small
scales


the
scales
give
the
butterfly
its
color


wings
and
flight
butterflies
have
a
very
characteristic
flying
style


they
usually
do
not
fly
in
straight
lines


their
style
is
well
described
by
the
children
version
of
their
name


some
species
are
capable
of
strong
long
flights

migration
and
others
never
leave
the
woods
they
were
born
in


they
can
survive
bird
pecks
on
the
wings
quite
well


late
in
the
season
damage
to
their
wings
can
often
be
seen
and
still
they
continue
flying
quite
well


head
the
head
is
the
first
part
of
the
body


it
has
the
eyes
mouth
parts
and
antennae


the
eyes
of
a
butterfly
are
large


the
eye
is
made
up
of
smaller
eyes
or
optical
units


eyes
that
are
made
up
of
optical
units
are
called
<collocation>compound eyes</collocation>


butterflies
do
not
see
as
many
colors
as
humans
but
they
can
see
ultraviolet
light


the
mouth
of
an
adult
butterfly
does
not
have
jaws


it
has
a
kind
of
mouth
that
is
made
to
<collocation>suck liquids</collocation>


this
mouth
is
called
a
proboscis


the
proboscis
is
made
up
of
two
<collocation>hollow tubes</collocation>


the
tubes
are
locked
together
in
the
middle


when
the
butterfly
is
not
using
its
proboscis
it
is
coiled
up
in
the
head


it
can
uncoil
the
proboscis
when
it
wants
to
feed


the
antennae
of
a
butterfly
are
used
for
smell
and
balance


the
antenna
in
most
butterflies
is
clubbed
at
the
end


in
some
butterflies
like
the
skippers
there
is
a
hook
at
the
end
of
the
antenna
instead
of
a
club


thorax
a
<collocation>closeup picture</collocation>
of
a
butterfly
wings


the
thorax
is
the
second
part
of
the
body


it
is
made
up
of
three
segments


the
legs
and
wings
are
connected
to
the
thorax


the
legs
of
a
butterfly
are
made
for
walking
holding
onto
things
and
tasting


there
are
three
pairs
of
legs


there
are
four
main
parts
of
the
leg


they
are
the
the
femur
the
tibia
and
the
foot


at
the
end
of
each
foot
there
is
a
pair
of
claws


butterflies
in
the
family
have
very
short
front
legs


they
keep
there
front
legs
close
to
their
bodies


this
makes
it
look
like
they
only
have
two
pairs
of
legs


in
some
species
there
is
a
movable
body
part
on
the
tibia
that
is
used
to
clean
the
antennae


a
butterfly
has
two
pairs
of
wings


each
wing
has
<collocation>hollow tubes</collocation>
called
veins


the
colors
and
patterns
of
butterflies
are
made
by
tiny
scales


the
scales
over
lap
each
other


they
are
connected
to
the
wing


if
a
butterfly
is
handled
the
tiny
scales
may
rub
off


abdomen
the
abdomen
is
the
third
part
of
the
body


it
is
made
up
of
ten
segments


the
abdomen
is
much
softer
than
the
head
and
the
thorax


at
the
end
of
the
abdomen
are
the
<collocation>reproductive organs</collocation>


in
the
male
there
is
a
pair
of


they
are
used
to
hold
on
to
the
female
during
mating


in
the
female
there
is
a
tube
made
to
lay
eggs


life
cycle
butterflies
go
through
<collocation>complete metamorphosis</collocation>


this
means
that
there
are
four
parts
in
a
butterfly
life


the
first
part
is
the
egg


the
second
part
is
the
caterpillar
sometimes
called
the
larva


the
third
part
is
the
chrysalis
sometimes
called
the
pupa


the
fourth
part
is
the
adult
sometimes
called
the


egg
a
<collocation>common castor</collocation>
ariadne
egg


a
female
butterfly
will
lay
her
eggs
on
or
near
the
food
plant
of
the
caterpillar
the
food
plant
is
the
plant
that
the
caterpillar
feeds
on


the
female
will
choose
a
place
to
lay
her
eggs
using
smell
taste
touch
and
sight


most
species
will
lay
just
one
egg
on
the
food
plant


others
will
lay
groups
of
five
to
over
eggs
on
the
food
plant


most
species
will
lay
their
eggs
on
the
leaves
of
the
food
plant


others
will
lay
them
on
the
flowers
stems
bark
or
fruit
of
the
food
plant


the
eggs
come
in
many
different
shapes
and
colors


they
may
be
round
or
oval
and
flattened


in
some
species
the
egg
shell
is
ribbed


the
most
common
colors
in
<collocation>butterfly eggs</collocation>
are
yellow
and
green


the
eggs
will
turn
dark
just
before
hatching


also
some
butterflies
take
a
day
to
come
out
of
eggs
while
others
could
take
months


caterpillar
main

note
the
variation
a
old
world
swallowtail
caterpillar
showing
its
<collocation>butterfly caterpillars</collocation>
can
vary
in
size
color
and
shape


they
may
have
spines
bristles
or
soft
body
extensions


all
caterpillars
have
body
segments


the
first
three
segments
make
up
the
thorax


the
thorax
has
three
pairs
of
legs


these
legs
are
called
true

the
other
segments
make
up
the

the
abdomen
has
five
pairs
of
soft

<collocation>tiny hooks</collocation>
at
the
end
of
the
each
foot


they
are
used
to
hold
on
to
things


the
hooks
are
called
crochets


a
caterpillar
skin
does
not
grow


as
the
caterpillar
grows
inside
its
skin
the
skin
becomes
too
tight


in
order
for
the
caterpillar
to
grow
bigger
it
sheds
its
skin


after
the
old
skin
is
shed
there
is
a
new
larger
skin


this
is
known
as
molting


a
caterpillar
will
molt
four
to
five
times
before
turning
into
a
pupa


each
part
between
is
called
an
instar


all
caterpillars
can
make
silk


the
silk
is
made
from
the
salivary
glands


silk
starts
out
as
a
liquid
in
the
salivary
glands


the
caterpillar
draws
out
the
silk
into
a
small
thread


the
silk
hardens
as
soon
as
it
is
exposed
to
the
air


caterpillars
use
silk
to
make
nests
or
cocoons


most
caterpillars
feed
on
leaves
of
plants
or
trees


most
species
of
caterpillars
will
feed
only
on
a
small
number
of
certain
kinds
of
plants


if
the
caterpillar
food
plant
is
not
found
it
will
starve
to
death


some
species
of
caterpillars
in
the
family
are
tended
by
ants


the
caterpillars
have
special
glands
that
make
a
sweet
liquid
called
honeydew


the
ants
like
the
honeydew


in
return
for
the
honeydew
the
ants
protect
the
caterpillars
from
predators


the
caterpillars
also
have
special
body
parts
that
make
sounds


the
caterpillar
will
make
sounds
with
the
body
parts
and
call
the
ants
when
the
caterpillar
is
being
attacked
by
predators


the
ants
hear
the
sounds
and
come
to
protect
the
caterpillar

these
hooks

do
not

instead
the

some
types
of

some
people
plant
a

having
lots
