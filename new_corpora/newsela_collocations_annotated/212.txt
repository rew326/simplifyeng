history
silver

second

silver
was

more
valuable
than

the
silver

running
out
very
quickly
because
more
of

has
been
used
each
year
than
the
amount
mined
in
each

companies
that
use
silver
have
benefitted
from
speculators
who
sell
promises
to
deliver
silver
that
does
not
exist
keeping
prices
artificially
low


this
is
called
naked
short
selling


the
amount
owed
is
more
than
all
the
silver
in
the
world


the
price
of
silver
could
go
very
high
when
the
stored
silver
runs
out
and
investors
start
asking
for
their

back
instead
of

douglas
a
researcher

research
institute
wanted
to
find
a
way
to
make
using
computers
easier


in
those
days
computers
were
large
and
expensive


using
them
was
very
hard
because
everything
had
to
be
typed
in
by
hand
and
there
was
no
way
to
alter
things
if
you
made
a
mistake


after
studying
and
designing
for
a
long
time
succeeded
in
inventing
an
input
device
which
he
named
index


at
first
it
needed
two
hands
to
use
but
it
was
changed
so
that
only
one
hand
was
needed
to
use
it


this

how
to
make
metals
or
get
metals
from
rocks
the
rocks
are
made
of
a
metal
with
oxygen
called
an
oxide


separating
the
oxygen
off
the
metal
is
called
smelting


this
is
done
with
chemistry
or
electricity
and
is
usually
done
at
very
high


this
is
the
first
step
in
metallurgy


a
rock
containing
enough
metal
to
be
profitable
is
called
ore


iron
is
from
<collocation>iron ore</collocation>
in
large
reactors
called
blast
furnaces


a
blast
furnace
is
a
tall
vertical
structure
which
is
fed
with
coke
<collocation>iron ore</collocation>
and
limestone


when
hot
air
is
blown
in
the
blast
furnace
the
coke
will
burn
and
reduce
the
oxygen
off
the
ore
producing
bare
iron
and
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>


the
limestone
will
bind
off
any
remaining
bedrock


the
iron
melts
in
the
hot
temperature
and
is
tapped
off
in
liquid
phase
at
the
bottom


it
is
then
worked
into
steel


the
limestone
and
bedrock
form
a
compound
called
slag


it
can
be
used
for
making
bricks
concrete
or
road
topping


aluminum
is
in
electric
ovens
called
electric
arc
furnaces


the
<collocation>aluminum ore</collocation>
is
poured
on
the
bottom
of
the
furnace
and
electric
current
is
led
through
the
ore


the
temperature
rises
so
high
that
the
oxygen
separates
leaving
<collocation>metallic aluminum</collocation>


copper
is
poured
on
naked
flame
which
burns
off
sulfur
and
other
impurities
leaving
raw
copper


the
copper
is
then
that
is
separated
by
electric
current
in
big
pools
which
contain
water
solution
called
electrolyte


an
electric
current
is
led
in
the
pool
and
all
copper
will
gather
on
the
electrode
called
cathode


metal
parts
another
part
of
metallurgy
is
making
parts
from
metals


these
parts
must
be
made
so
they
will
not
break
when
they
are
used


work
to
make
the
metal
good
when
they
are
used


sometimes
the
metal
must
be
strong


other
times
it
must
be
tough
not
easily
broken


the
metallurgist
must
follow
directions
when
making
the
part
to
know
what
metal
to
use


steel
has
a
low
cost
but
rusts


choosing
a
good
metal
is
sometimes
hard


making
metal
parts
a
metal
starts
as
a
block
called
an
ingot


must
know
how
to
make
a
metal
part
from
an
ingot


parts
are
made
from
ingots
different
ways


when
a
big
hammer
is
used
it
is
called
forging


to
make
thin
metals
a
metal
is
put
between
two
rolls
and
moved
called
rolling


making
metal
hot
makes
it
easier
to
change
the
shape
of
a
metal
part


for
this
reason
most
metal
parts
are
made
using
hot
metal


this
is
hot
work


two
metal
parts
can
be
put
together
with
much
heat


this
is
called
welding


iron
is
easy
to
weld


how
to
know
what
to
do
to
the
metal
use
many
tools
to
know
what
to
do
to
the
metal


the
most
useful
is
the
microscope


the
microscope
gives
much
information
about
the
way
the
metal
moves


metals
are
sometimes
pulled
until
they
break


this
is
the
tension
test


some
useful
information
can
be
gotten
from
