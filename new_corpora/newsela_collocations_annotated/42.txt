linear
algebra
is
a
branch
of
mathematics


it
came
from
mathematicians
trying
to
solve
systems
of
<collocation>linear equations</collocation>


vectors
and
matrices
are
used
to
solve
these
systems


the
main
objects
of
study
currently
are
vector
spaces
and
linear
between
vector
spaces


linear
algebra
is
useful
in
other
branches
of
mathematics
<collocation>differential equations</collocation>
and
analytic
geometry


it
can
also
be
applied
to
the
real
world
in
areas
such
as
engineering
physics
and
economics


linear
algebra
describes
ways
to
solve
and
manipulate
rearrange
systems
of
<collocation>linear equations</collocation>


for
example
consider
the
following
equations
begin
matrix
x
y
x
end
matrix
these
two
equations
form
a
system
of
<collocation>linear equations</collocation>


it
is
linear
because
none
of
the
variables
are
raised
to
a
power


the
graph
of
a
linear
equation
in
two
variables
is
a
straight
line


the
solution
to
this
system
is
begin
matrix
x
y
end
matrix
since
it
makes
all
of
the
original
equations
valid
that
is
the
value
on
left
side
of
the
equals
sign
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
value
on
the
right
