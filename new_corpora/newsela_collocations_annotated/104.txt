a
section
of
a
dead
person
lung
that
shows
<collocation>severe emphysema</collocation>


the
black
bubbles
are
alveoli
that
have
expanded
and
become
filed
with
black
carbon
that
is
from
smoking


a
thoracic
of
a
person
with
emphysema


at
the
arrow
in
the
left
lung
right
side
of
picture
can
be
seen
a
faint
bubbly
section
that
looks
like
a
ghostly
bunch
of
grapes


this
is
emphysema


emphysema
is
a
disease
of
the
lungs


it
is
one
of
the
diseases
that
make
up
chronic
pulmonary
disease
which
is
a
set
of
diseases
where
the
flow
of
air
in
the
lungs
is
obstructed


emphysema
is
most
often
caused
by
smoking
but
can
be
caused
by
other
diseases
or
have
no
known
cause
at
all


it
occurs
when
the
very
small
air
sacs
called
the
alveoli
at
the
ends
of
the
airways
in
the
lungs
start
to
break
down
from
many
sacs
to
form
much
bigger
sacs


the
alveoli
are
the
areas
of
the
lung
where
oxygen
and
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
are
exchanged
into
and
out
of
the
blood


emphysema
makes
it
hard
for
people
to
blow
air
out
of
the
lungs
because
air
gets
trapped
inside
the
broken
alveoli
due
to
the
collapse
of
the
walls


there
is
no
cure
at
the
moment
for
emphysema
but
treatment
includes
stopping
smoking
and
taking
medicines


sometimes
small
amounts
of
oxygen
are
given
to
the
patient
but
large
amounts
can
cause
problems


sometimes
sections
of
the
lungs
can
collapse
causing
a
pneumothorax
where
the
lung
comes
away
from
the
walls
of
the
chest


this
is
a
medical
emergency
and
needs
the
patient
to
go
to
a
hospital
emergency
department


emphysema
can
often
lead
to
the
death
of
the
patient


people
who
suffer
from
emphysema
may
also
have
<collocation>swollen legs</collocation>
and
ankles


this
is
due
to
a
build
up
of
<collocation>lymphatic fluid</collocation>
in
the
tissues
which
also
may
happen
in
the
lungs


this
happens
due
to
failure
or
the
right
side
of
the
heart


severe
cases
of
emphysema
require
hospital
treatment
but
there
is
little
that
can
be
done
to
help


the
damage
can
not
be
reversed


large
amounts
of
oxygen
are
not
and
should
not
be
given
because
this
can
actually
lead
to
the
person
to
stop
breathing


this
is
because
a
person
with
emphysema
becomes
used
to
having
a
high
amount
of
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
co
in
their
blood
and
the
body
switches
to
using
the
amount
of
oxygen
o


when
this
happens
if
a
person
gets
too
much
oxygen
the
body
slows
down
breathing
and
can
even
stop
breathing
altogether


this
microscope
image
shows
the
very
large
expanded
sections
of
lung
tissue


these
holes
should
be
tiny
and
there
should
be
thousands
of
them
instead
of
only
hundreds

oxygen
o
is
a
<collocation>chemical element</collocation>


in
nature
oxygen
is
a
gas
with
no
color
or
smell


oxygen
is
a
very
important
element
because
it
is
a
part
of
the
air
people
breathe
and
the
water
people
drink


because
of
this
oxygen
supports
life


many
living
things
including
humans
need
oxygen
to
live
and
breathe
though
it
is
poisonous
to
some
forms
of
life


in
liquid
state
of
matter
oxygen
is

discovery
of
oxygen
oxygen
was
initially
discovered
in
by
carl


then
joseph
also
discovered
it
two
years
later
and
spread
the
news
before


this
made
many
people
think
that
discovered
oxygen
first


the
word
oxygen
comes
from
greek
words
acid
and
generate


oxygen
comes
to
earth
from
all
parts
of
the
universe
in
meteorites


it
is
also
found
in
minerals
and
plants
that
grow
on
the
earth
and
other
planets


oxygen
in
nature
a
drop
of
water


water
contains
oxygen


when
one
oxygen
atom
combines
with
two
hydrogen
atoms
they
form
a
molecule
of
water
also
written
as
h
o


this
water
is
required
by
all
living
things
to
live


air
also
contains
oxygen


air
is
made
of
many
gases
that
are
mixed
together


approximately
of
the
air
is
oxygen


oxygen
is
especially
important
because
all
animals
use
oxygen
to
get
energy
from
their
food


combustion
of
wood
in
a
match


uses
of
oxygen
oxygen
is
also
what
makes
burning
possible


this
is
called
combustion


when
an
object
or
something
burns
or
combusts
oxygen
combines
with
another
substance
and
releases
heat
and
light


for
instance
when
you
burn
wood
the
oxygen
in
air
combines
with
the
wood
to
create
fire


this
ability
of
oxygen
has
many
uses


but
it
also
makes
very
dangerous


if
pure
oxygen
touches
a
flame
or
spark
it
can
combust
and
cause
great
damage


combustion
is
used
in
many
ways


for
example
when
oxygen
is
mixed
with
acetylene
it
can
create
a
very
hot
flame


the
hot
flame
is
used
in
welding
where
metal
is
heated
and
melted
together


also
oxygen
is
used
to
create
powerful
fuels
which
also
can
be
used
in
rockets
and
jets


oxygen
can
be
used
in
smelting
metal
from
ore


oxygen
is
used
in
hospitals
for
killing
bacteria


it
is
also
used
when
a
patient
has
had
<collocation>carbon monoxide</collocation>
poisoning


oxygen
is
used
in
water
treatment
to
purify
the
water
to
make
it
safe
for
us
to
drink


production
of
gas
pure
oxygen
can
be
produced
in
several
ways


in
nature
plants
produce
oxygen
by
using
sunlight
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
another
gas
and
water


this
process
is
called
photosynthesis


most
of
the
oxygen
in
the
air
is
produced
by
photosynthesis


oxygen
can
also
be
created
by
humans
using
a
process
called
electrolysis


in
this
process
electricity
passes
through
water


as
a
result
the
water
molecules
break
and
release
oxygen
and
hydrogen
gas

blood
is
a
liquid
in
humans
and
many
animals


blood
is
pushed
through
the
organism
by
the
heart
and
brings
nutrients
and
oxygen
to
our
tissues


it
also
takes
away
waste
and
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
from
tissues


blood
is
made
up
of
blood
plasma
and
various
cells
red
<collocation>blood cells</collocation>
white
<collocation>blood cells</collocation>
and
platelets


platelets
help
<collocation>blood clot</collocation>


hemoglobin
is
in
red
<collocation>blood cells</collocation>


white
<collocation>blood cells</collocation>
help
fight
infections
and
heal
wounds

plasma
is
