academic
education
from

for
a
few
years

royals
and
aristocrats

and
london


in

king
george

he
met
the
composer
christian
bach
one
of
the
sons
of
bach


he
played
duets
with
him


in
he
was
in
vienna
again


he
was
ill
with
smallpox


he
recovered
but
his
face
was
for
life


he
went
to
italy
where
he
heard
music
by
many
famous
italian
composers
including
who
had
written
a
piece
called
miserere


this
piece
had
been
written
for
the
pope
for
the
choir
of
the
vatican
to
sing


no
one
was
allowed
to
see
the
written
music
so
that
no
other
choir
would
be
able
to
sing
it


mozart
heard
the
piece
once
and
then
wrote
it
all
down
from
memory


he
met
the
pope
and
was
given
a
knighthood
order
of
the
golden
spur


in
he
went
on
a
journey
with
his
mother


in
he
fell
in
love
with
weber


she
was
years
old
and
studying
singing


mozart
wanted
to
take
her
to
italy
to
make
her
famous
but
his
father
put
a
stop
to
these
plans


by
mozart
and
his
mother
were
in
paris


his
mother
died
there


mozart
in
vienna
mozart
wrote
some
small
operas
when
he
was
young
but
his
first
really
important
opera
was


it
was
first
performed
in
munich
in


the
next
year
he
went
to
vienna


by
this
time
he
was
working
like
his
father
for
the
archbishop
of


when
he
went
back
to
he
argued
with
the
archbishop
who
actually
kicked
him
out


mozart
went
off
to
vienna
where
he
would
spend
the
rest
of
his
life


in
he
married
weber
one
of
the
three
younger
sisters
of
who
by
now
was
married
to
someone
else


they
were
to
have
seven
children
but
five
of
them
died
in
childhood


mozart
father
did
not
approve
of
the
marriage


was
a
loving
wife
but
like
mozart
she
was
not
good
at
looking
after
money
so
they
were
often
very
poor


in
that
same
year
mozart
wrote
another
very
successful
opera
die
dem
the
abduction
from
the
seraglio


one
famous
story
tells
that
after
the
emperor
had
heard
the
opera
he
told
mozart
that
there
were
too
many
notes


mozart
answered
just
as
many
as
are
necessary
your
majesty


<collocation>unfinished portrait</collocation>
of
mozart


mozart
started
a
series
of
concerts
in
which
he
played
his
own
<collocation>piano concertos</collocation>
conducting
from
the
keyboard


he
met
the
composer
joseph
haydn
and
the
two
men
became
great
friends
often
playing
together
in
a
string
quartet


haydn
said
to
mozart
one
day
before
god
and
as
an
honest
man
i
tell
you
that
your
son
is
the
greatest
composer
known
to
me
either
in
person
or
by
name


he
has
taste
and
what
is
more
the
most
<collocation>profound knowledge</collocation>
of
composition


mozart
was
in
the
same
masonic
lodge
as
haydn
and
he
dedicated
some
of
his
string
quartets
to
him


the
audiences
in
vienna
did
not
give
mozart
much
support
after
a
few
years
so
he
often
went
to
prague
where
the
audiences
loved
him


his
opera
the
marriage
of
figaro
was
very
popular
and
in
he
gave
the
first
performance
there
of
his
opera
don


final
illness
and
death
there
are
several
stories
about
mozart
last
illness
and
death
and
it
is
not
easy
to
be
sure
what
happened


he
was
working
on
an
opera
the
magic
flute
which
is
one
of
his
best
works
and
a
very
popular
opera
today


it
is
written
in
german
not
italian
like
most
of
his
other
operas


in
some
ways
it
is
like
an
english
pantomime


at
the
same
time
that
he
was
working
on
this
he
was
asked
by
a
stranger
to
compose
a
requiem


he
was
told
to
write
this
in
secret


then
he
was
asked
to
write
an
italian
opera
la
di
which
was
performed
in
prague
during
september


at
the
end
of
september
the
magic
flute
was
given
its
first
performance


mozart
then
worked
very
hard
at
the
requiem


he
must
have
realized
that
he
was
already
very
ill
and
that
in
a
way
the
requiem
a
mass
for
the
dead
was
for
himself


he
died
in
vienna
before
he
could
finish
it


asked
another
composer
a
man
called
franz
to
finish
the
work


mozart
was
buried
in
an
unmarked
grave
because
there
was
no
money
for
a
proper
funeral


mozart
music
mozart
music
like
that
of
haydn
is
the
very
best
of
what
is
known
as
the
classical
style


at
the
time
he
started
to
compose
the
baroque
period
was
just
coming
to
an
end


tastes
were
changing
in
music


form
balance
and
elegance
were
thought
of
as
more
important
than
counterpoint


mozart
was
the
first
great
composer
to
write
music
for
the
piano
an
instrument
which
had
only
just
become
popular


he
wrote
almost
every
kind
of
music
symphonies
operas
<collocation>solo concertos</collocation>
chamber
music
especially
string
quartets
and
string
and
the
<collocation>piano sonata</collocation>


he
also
wrote
a
lot
of
religious
music
including
masses
as
well
as
popular
music
like
dances
and
serenades


when
mozart
was
young
a
symphony
was
usually
a
short
simple
piece
for
entertainment


mozart
made
the
symphony
into
a
carefully
piece
lasting
up
to
half
an
hour


his
last
three
symphonies
are
especially
<collocation>fine masterpieces</collocation>


his
concertos
especially
his
<collocation>piano concertos</collocation>
are
far
more
advanced
than
anything
that
had
been
written
before


although
mozart
behaved
in
truly
<collocation>childish ways</collocation>
at
times
he
was
good
at
understanding
human
character


this
is
clear
in
his
operas
where
he
introduced
many
<collocation>subtle effects</collocation>
to
describe
the
characters
in
the
story


mozart
operas
are
among
his
greatest
works


he
understood
people
characters
very
well
and
was
able
to
write
music
which
tells
us
everything
about
the
personalities
in
the
operas


the
three
operas
in
which
he
set
words
by
da
don
le
di
figaro
the
marriage
of
figaro
and
fan
each
include
some
very
clever
ensembles
in
which
several
characters
are
singing
at
once
each
one
showing
his
or
her
view
of
the
situation


as
well
as
many
great
masterpieces
mozart
wrote
many
pieces
in
a
more
popular
style
including
some
tunes
that
everybody
knows
today


his
serenade
is
known
everywhere
as
is
the
<collocation>turkish rondo</collocation>
from
his
<collocation>piano sonata</collocation>
in
a
the
opening
of
the
symphony
no
in
g
minor
and
the
song
from
the
magic
flute

works

a
man

all
mozart
music
tried
to
put
them
in

and
gave
them
a

us
to

july
was
a
german
composer
and
organist


he
lived
in
the
last
part
of
the
baroque
period


he
never
traveled
very
far
spending
all
his
life
in
central
germany
but
he
studied
all
the
music
he
could
find
by
other
composers
of
his
time


his
own
music
shows
that
he
learned
from
the
music
of
italian
french
and
german
composers


he
spent
several
years
working
at
courts
of
noblemen


here
he
wrote
most
of
his
chamber
music
and
orchestral
music


most
of
his
life
however
he
worked
in
a
church
where
he
was
expected
to
write
church
music


bach
wrote
almost
every
kind
of
music
except
opera


during
the
last
part
of
his
life
most
composers
were
writing
in
a
new
style
called
the
classical
style
but
bach
always
wrote
in
the
baroque
style


that
made
some
people
at
the
time
think
he
was
but
today
we
know
that
his
work
is
the
very
best
of
baroque
music

early
life
bach
came
from
a
highly
musical
family


many
of
his
relatives
were
professional
musicians
of
some
sort
violinists
and
town
musicians
directors
of
music
in
a
church
court
musicians
and
directors
of

most
of
them
played
several
instruments


of
his
twenty

became
quite
famous
composers
especially
carl
bach
christian
bach
bach
and
bach


when
he
was
fifteen
he
went
to
the
small
town
of


at
first
he
sang
treble
in
the
choir
but
his
voice
very
soon
got
lower
so
he
made
himself
useful
playing
instruments


he
learned
by
listening
to
famous
like
and


bach
got
his
first
job
in
in


it
was
a
job
for
a
young
boy
who
was
years
old


there
was
a
new
organ
in
the
church
and
bach
already
knew
a
lot
about
organ
building
as
well
as
being
a
brilliant
organist


they
asked
him
to
examine
the
new
organ
and
then
they
offered
him
a
job


bach
spent
four
years
as
organist
there


he
composed
some
organ
works


unfortunately
the
congregation
were
not
musical
enough
to
like
it


they
did
not
understand
the
<collocation>ornamental notes</collocation>
he
added
to
the
hymn
tunes


bach
got
rather
fed
up
with
the
priests
who
were
always
complaining
about
it
so
he
resigned
and
took
another
job
in
not
far
away


after
a
year
there
he
gave
up
that
job
and
went
to
a
big
town
called


years
bach
in
was
made
organist
to
the
duke
of


at
the
duke
court
there
was
a
chapel
with
an
organ


bach
composed
many
of
his
great
organ
works
at
this
time


he
became
very
famous
as
an
organist
as
was
invited
to
play
in
other
big
churches
and
to
give
advice
on
organ
building


he
was
extremely
good
at
improvisation


on
one
occasion
he
was
in
dresden
at
the
same
time
as
a
french
organist
named
louis


there
was
going
to
be
a
competition
between
the
two
men
to
see
who
was
better
at
improvisation


bach
was
practicing
the
day
before
and
heard
him


he
realized
that
bach
would
win
so
he
ran
away


in
the
duke
made
bach
<collocation>concert master</collocation>
which
meant
he
earned
more
money


he
had
to
write
cantatas
for
church
services


in
he
was
offered
a
job
in
the
town
of
where
he
would
earn
an
even
better
salary


the
duke
was
angry
and
did
not
want
him
to
go
but
bach
insisted
so
the
duke
put
bach
in
prison
for
a
month


in
the
end
he
had
to
let
the
musician
go


at
bach
worked
for
prince


the
prince
was
very
musical
and
a
nice
man
to
work
for


bach
was
kapellmeister
director
of
music
and
was
treated
well


the
organ
was
not
very
good
and
it
was
not
used
much
so
bach
did
not
write
any
organ
music
during
this
period


the
duke
had
an
orchestra
and
bach
was
in
charge


nearly
all
bach
orchestral
works
were
written
in
the
concertos
the
<collocation>violin concertos</collocation>
the
orchestral
suites
the
solo
music
for
violin
and
for
cello
and
a
lot
of
keyboard
music
for
harpsichord
or
clavichord


during
the
great
composer
george
handel
who
had
moved
to
england
came
to
germany
to
visit
his
mother


bach
wanted
to
meet
handel
who
was
only
km
away
but
these
two
famous
musicians
never
met


handel
wanted
to
spend
his
limited
time
in
germany
with
his
mother
who
was
old
and
frail
knowing
that
it
would
be
the
last

he
would
see

however
several
of
his

died
young


leipzig
bach
in
by
an
unknown
artist
in
bach
shifted
to
leipzig
to
take
the
job
of
cantor
at
the
st
thomas
church
a
very
large
church
in
the
town


as
cantor
he
was
in
charge
of
all
the
music
both
at
st
thomas
and
at
another
church
nearby


he
also
had
to
compose
music
for
the
town


it
was
an
excellent
job
and
more
secure
than
being
at
a
court


the
schools
were
good
for
his
sons


bach
stayed
in
leipzig
until
his
death


he
loved
his
job
most
of
the
time
and
worked
very
hard


he
composed
many
cantatas
for
the
church
services


these
services
were
very
long
lasting
about
three
hours


many
of
the
cantatas
he
wrote
last
about
minutes
and
that
was
just
one
part
of
a
service


he
had
assistants
to
play
the
organ


bach
himself
directed
the
choir
and
the
orchestra


there
were
probably
singers
in
the
choir
and
players
in
the
orchestra


he
wrote
the
st
matthew
passion
and
the
st
john
passion


both
these
works
which
are
very
long
tell
the
story
of
jesus
dying
on
the
cross


they
are
among
the
most
famous
pieces
of
music
ever
written


he
also
wrote
cantatas
for
special
occasions
such
as
weddings
or
funerals


life
was
not
always
easy
and
there
were
sometimes
arguments
with
the
people
who
ruled
the
church


the
wanted
to
choose
some
of
the
hymns
but
this
was
the
cantor
job


bach
was
a
sensible
man
and
he
managed
to
get
his
way
without
making
enemies


on
another
occasion
he
argued
with
the
headmaster
of
the
school
bach
had
to
do
some
teaching
at
the
church
school
about
who
was
allowed
to
choose
the
choir
section
leaders


this
actually
went
to
court
and
bach
won
the
case


bach
often
made
journeys
to
other
towns


in
he
visited
the
court
of
prussian
king
frederick
the
great
near
berlin


the
king
a
music
lover
gave
bach
a
theme
to
improvise
from
on
the
harpsichord


bach
sat
down
and
improvised
a
fugue
using
this
theme


later
bach
wrote
a
very
long
composition
for
flute
violin
and
harpsichord
with
cello
accompaniment
in
many
movements
all
based
on
this
theme


at
the
end
the
theme
is
heard
in
of
the
voices


bach
called
it
the
musical
offering
and
he
sent
it
to
king


bach
wrote
many
eventually
he
decided
to
write
a
collection
called
the
art
of
fugue


his
plan
was
to
publish
it
but
he
died
before
he
could
finish
it
his
son
later
published
it
in
his
honor
as
bach
last
published
piece


in
the
last
year
or
two
of
his
life
he
became
blind
in
spite
of
two
eye
operations

history
of
earth
atmosphere
originally
the
earth
atmosphere
had
almost
no
free
oxygen


it
gradually
changed
to
what
it
is
today
over
a
very
long
time
see
great
oxygenation
event


the
process
began
with


they
were
the
first
organisms
to
make
free
oxygen
by
photosynthesis


most
organisms
today
need
oxygen
for
their
metabolism
only
a
few
can
use
other
sources
for
respiration


temperature
and
the
<collocation>atmospheric layers</collocation>
some
parts
of
the
atmosphere
are
hot
or
cold
depending
on
height


if
something
climbed
straight
up
it
would
get
colder
but
then
it
would
get
hotter
as
the
object
climbed
higher


these
changes
of
temperature
are
divided
into
layers


these
are
like
layers
of
an
onion


however
no
difference
can
be
seen
between
each
layer


they
are
just
places
where
the
temperature
changes
differently


these
are
the
layers
of
the
atmosphere
starting
from
the
ground
starts
at
the
ground


ends
somewhere
between
convert
to
km
off


the
higher
the
colder


weather
in
this
layer
affects
our
daily
life


stratosphere
starts
at
convert
to
km
off


ends
at
convert
km
off


the
higher
the
hotter


there
is
little
water
vapor
and
other
substances
in
this
layer


airplanes
fly
in
this
layer
because
it
is
usually
stable
and
air
resistance
is
small


mesosphere
starts
at
convert
km
off


ends
at
convert
or
km
off


the
higher
the
colder


winds
in
this
layer
are
strong
so
the
temperature
is
not
stable
