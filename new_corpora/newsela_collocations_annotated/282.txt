caterpillars
an
larva
a
larva
many
animals
develop
in
separate
stages


a
larva
plural
larvae
develops
from
the
egg
in
those
animals


it
is
a
separate
life
stage
from
the
adult
reproductive
stage


a
larva
does
not
look
like
the
adult
animal
and
changes
shape
known
as
metamorphosis
as
it
grows
up


there
may
be
several
<collocation>larval stages</collocation>
before
the
adult
form


tadpoles
maggots
and
caterpillars
are
larvae


marine
organisms
with
a
<collocation>larval stage</collocation>
often
release
large
numbers
of
eggs
and
sperms
into
the
water
column


after
fertilisation
the
eggs
develop
into
tiny
larvae


the
larvae
develop
and
grow
for
some
time
before
into
adults


most
<collocation>marine invertebrates</collocation>
and
many
fish
have
a
<collocation>larval stage</collocation>
or
eggs


these
live
in
the
plankton
and
may
be
transported
long
distances


evolutionary
theory
probably
the
most
widely
accepted
theory
explaining
the
evolution
of
<collocation>larval stages</collocation>
is
the
need
for
dispersal


<collocation>sessile organisms</collocation>
such
as
barnacles
and
tunicates
and
groups
like
mussels
and
crabs
need
some
way
to
move
their
young
into
new
territory
since
they
can
not
move
long
distances
as
adults


many
species
have
relatively
long
<collocation>larval stages</collocation>
how
long
a
larva
is
in
the
water
column


during
this
time
larvae
feed
and
grow
and
many
species
move
through
several
stages
of
development


for
example
most
barnacles
through
six
larva
stages
before
to
a
when
they
look
to
settle


the
larvae
eat
different
food
from
the
adults
and
disperse


the
other
consideration
is
the
small
size
of
the
eggs


if
animals
lay
many
small
eggs
and
most
do
then
the
young
stages
can
not
live
the
life
the
adults
lead


they
must
live
a
separate
life
until
they
have
the
size
and
capability
to
live
as
an
adult


this
is
what
the
larvae
do


origin
of
vertebrates
a
theory
is
that
in
transformed
larvae
of
tunicates
lies
the
origin
of
vertebrates


tunicates
are
sessile
but
their
larvae
are
mobile
and
have
some
features
found
in
early
vertebrates


the
process
of
where
juvenile
features
are
retained
in
the
adult
is
the
proposed
mechanism


<collocation>genome analysis</collocation>
does
show
that
the
tunicates
are
the
closest
living
relatives
of
vertebrates

defences
amphibians

in
brown

green
and
if
so
they
are
prey
for

their
color
gives

defense


alternatively
many

have
toxic

which
is
harmful
to
predators


these
are

this
is
an
important
defense
against

connected
to
this
is
the
use

they
may
be
in
<collocation>vivid colors</collocation>
of

the
order
includes

protruding

tongue
and
no
tail


they
are
exceptional
jumpers
many
of
their
features
particularly
their
long
powerful
legs
are
adaptations

performance


they
often
live

a
popular
distinction
is
often
made
between
frogs
and
toads
on
the
basis
of
their
appearance


their
<collocation>warty skin</collocation>
is
an
adaptation
for
making
their
<collocation>toxic slime</collocation>


apart
from
these
glands
their
skin
is
dry
and
that
is
an
adaptation
to
drier
habitats


these
features
have
evolved
a
number
of
times
independently
<collocation>convergent evolution</collocation>


the
distinction
has
no
taxonomic
basis


the
only
family

is
the
true
toads

life

respiration
differs
between
species
of
salamanders


species
that
lack
lungs
through
gills


in
most
cases
these
are
<collocation>external gills</collocation>
visible
as
tufts
on
either
side
of
the
head


some
salamanders
that
are
terrestrial
have
lungs
that
are
used
in
respiration
although
these
are
simple
and
unlike
the
more
complex
organs
found
in
mammals


many
species
such
as
the
olm
have
both
lungs
and
gills
as
adults


some
terrestrial
species
lack
both
lungs
and
gills
and
perform
gas
exchange
through
their
skin


even
some
species
with
lungs
also
through
the
skin
in
this
manner


the
skin
of
salamanders
secretes
mucus


this
helps
to
keep
the
animal
moist
when
on
dry
land
keeps
their
salt
balance
while
in
water
and
lubricates
during
swimming


salamanders
also
secrete
poison
from
glands
in
their
skin
and
some
additionally
have
skin
glands
for
secreting
courtship
pheromones


from
the
genus
or
<collocation>mole salamanders</collocation>
are
amphibians


this
means
they
get
to
<collocation>sexual maturity</collocation>
and
reproduce
while
still
in
a
larval
form


<collocation>defense mechanisms</collocation>
most
salamanders
and
have
some
defense
against
predators
usually
a
poison
which
makes
them
uneatable


their
bright
colors
are
warning
colouration


if
instead
they
are
camouflaged
this
means
they
are
probably
not
protected
by
a
toxin


the
second
line
of
defense
is
to
shed
their
tail
which
can
grow
again


the
tail
wriggles
a
bit
attracts
the
predator
while
the
business
part
of
the
salamander
moves
off


other
characteristics
there
are
over
salamanders


most
of
them
are
terrestrial
and
are
active
in
daytime


salamanders
may
communicate
with
their
nose


slender
salamanders
are
found
in
the
pacific
coast


they
are
sometimes
called
<collocation>worm salamanders</collocation>


this
is
because
they
have
slimmer
skinny
bodies
than
most
salamanders


if
touched
slender
salamanders

bounce

then
run

the

it
is
a
fundamental
feature
of
that
their

the

they
may
wrap
their

they
do
this
so
their

will
not
drift
away


tree
frogs
usually
lay
their

on

bullfrogs
such
as
the
male
american
bullfrog
and
the
male
african
bullfrog
stay
with
their
tadpoles
and
protect
them
from
predators


they
also
move
their
tadpoles
by
using
their
nose
to
dig
a
channel
to
another
place
where
there
is
more
water


they
do
this
so
their

tadpoles
do

because
gills
have
a

tadpoles
can

by
