an
engine
or
motor
is
a
machine
used
to
change
energy
into
movement
that
can
be
used


the
energy
can
be
in
any
form


common
forms
of
energy
used
in
engines
are
electricity
chemical
such
as
petrol
or
diesel
or
heat


when
a
chemical
is
used
to
produce
energy
it
is
known
as
fuel


the
difference
of
engine
and
motor
is
that
an
engine
creates
mechanical
energy
from
heat
while
motor
creates
mechanical
energy
from
other
kinds
of
energy
like
electricity


typical
engines
are
steam
engine
and
internal
<collocation>combustion engine</collocation>
while
<collocation>typical motors</collocation>
are
electric
motor
and
hydraulic
motor

a

steam
engine


fuel
is
burn
in
the
tray
at
the
bottom
steam
is
made
in
boiler
which
works
the
piston
the
blue
part
which
turns
the
wheel
early
kinds
of
engine
used
heat
that
was
outside
of
the
engine
itself
to
heat
up
a
gas
to
a
high
pressure


this
was
usually
steam
and
the
engines
are
called
<collocation>steam engines</collocation>


the
steam
was
piped
to
the
engine
where
it
pushed
on
pistons
to
bring
about
motion


these
engines
were
commonly
used
in
old
factories
boats
and
trains


most
cars
use
a
chemical
engine
that
burns
fuel
inside
it


this
is
called
an
internal
<collocation>combustion engine</collocation>


there
are
many
different
types
of
internal
<collocation>combustion engine</collocation>


they
can
be
grouped
by
fuel
cycle
and
configuration


common
fuel
types
for
internal
<collocation>combustion engines</collocation>
are
petrol
diesel
and
alcohol


there
are
many
other
types
of
fuels


there
are
different
types
of
cycle


engine
cylinders
produce
power
once
every
turn
of
the
engine


<collocation>engines cylinders</collocation>
make
power
once
every
two
turns
of
the
engine


<collocation>engines cylinders</collocation>
make
power
twice
in
every
six
turns
of
the
engine


there
are
lots
of
different
configurations
of
<collocation>piston engines</collocation>


lots
have
cylinders
with
pistons
in
them
and
a
crankshaft


any
number
of
cylinders
can
be
used
but
and
are
common


the
cylinders
can
be
arranged
in
many
ways
in
a
straight
line
at
an
angle
to
each
other
or
in
a
circle


a
rotary
engine
has
no
cylinders
and
uses
a
triangle
shaped
rotor
spinning
in
an
<collocation>oval housing</collocation>
which
mimics
the
movement
of
a
piston


turbine
engines
the
inside
of
a
turbine
showing
the
fins
which
are
pushed
by
jets
of
steam
hot
gas
can
also
be
made
to
push
a
turbine
around
rather
like
the
way
the
wind
turns
a
windmill


most
electric
power
stations
use
big
steam
turbines


others
use
water
or
<collocation>wind turbines</collocation>


smaller
turbines
use
internal
combustion


jet
engines
used
in
aircraft
are
a
kind
of
turbine
engine


<collocation>rocket engines</collocation>
jets
of
hot
gas
push
a
rocket
a
rocket
causes
movement
by
shooting
jets
of
gas
very
fast
out
of
a
nozzle


the
gas
may
have
been
stored
under
pressure
or
be
a
chemical
fuel
that
burns
to
make
a
very
hot
gas


although
they
are
very
simple
rockets
are
the
most
powerful
engines
we
know
how
to
make


they
will
work
in
space
where
there
is
nothing
to
push
against


<collocation>electric motors</collocation>
an
electric
motor
<collocation>electric motors</collocation>
do
not
use
a
fuel


the
energy
is
supplied
to
them
by
electricity
carried
along
a
pair
of
wires


the
energy
may
come
from
a
fuel
being
burnt
somewhere
else
a

way
off

is
used
to
