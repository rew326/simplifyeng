infinity
is
about
things
which
never
end


sometimes
it
is
also
written


infinity
means
many
different
things
depending
on
when
it
is
used


the
word
is
from
a
latin
word
which
means
without
end


infinity
goes
on
forever
so
sometimes
space
numbers
and
other
things
are
said
to
be
infinite
because
they
never
come
to
a
stop


infinity
is
not
really
an
ordinary
number
but
it
is
sometimes
used
as
one


infinity
often
says
how
many
there
is
of
something
instead
of
how
big
something
is


for
example
there
are
infinitely
many
whole
numbers
called
integers
but
there
is
no
integer
which
is
infinitely
big


but
different
kinds
of
math
have
different
kinds
of
infinity


so
its
meaning
often
changes


there
are
two
kinds
of
infinity
<collocation>potential infinity</collocation>
and
<collocation>actual infinity</collocation>


<collocation>potential infinity</collocation>
is
a
process
that
never
stops


for
example
adding
to
a
number


no
matter
how
many
times
is
added
more
can
still
be
added


<collocation>actual infinity</collocation>
is
a
more
abstract
idea


for
example
there
are
infinitely
many
numbers
as
it
is
impossible
to
write
them
all
down


infinity
in
<collocation>mathematics mathematicians</collocation>
use
different
kinds
of
infinity


for
example
<collocation>uncountable sets</collocation>
are
bigger
than
<collocation>countable sets</collocation>


both
kinds
of
set
are
infinitely
big

history
main
history
of
japan
the
earliest
records
on
japan
are
from
chinese
documents


one
of
those
records
said
there
were
many
small
countries
in
japan
which
had
wars
between
them
and
later
a
country
ruled
by
a
queen
became
the
strongest
unified
others
and
peace
came


the
japanese
began
to
write
their
own
history
after
the
and
centuries
when
people
from
korea
and
china
taught
japan
about
the
chinese
writing
system


japan
neighbors
also
showed
them
the
ways
of
buddhism


the
japanese
changed
buddhism
in
many
ways
for
example
by
building
strongly
on
ideas
such
as
zen
which
came
from
mainland
asia


in
the
ancient
and
the
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>
china
gave
japan
many
new
cultural
ideas
but
their
friendship
became
weaker
later


in
the
late
century
mongolians
from
china
tried
to
invade
japan
twice
but
they
could
not


the
samurai
and
shogun
of
medieval
japan
are
similar
to
knights
and
lords
in
medieval
europe


japan
had
some
contact
with
the
europeans
in
the
century


the
portuguese
were
the
first
europeans
to
visit
japan


later
the
spanish
english
and
dutch
came
to
japan
to
trade


also
they
brought
christianity


japan
leaders
welcomed
them
at
first
but
because
europeans
had
conquered
many
places
in
the
world
the
japanese
were
scared
they
would
conquer
japan
too


so
the
japanese
did
not
let
the
europeans
come
into
japan
anymore
except
in
a
small
area
in
nagasaki
city


many
christians
were
killed


only
chinese
korean
and
dutch
people
were
allowed
to
visit
japan
in
the
end
and
they
were
under
careful
control
of
the
japanese
government


japan
was
opened
for
visitors
again
in
by
<collocation>commodore matthew</collocation>
perry
when
the
americans
wanted
to
use
japanese
ports
for
american
whale
boats


perry
brought
steamships
with
guns
which
scared
the
japanese
into
making
an
agreement
with
him


this
new
contact
with
europeans
and
americans
changed
the
japanese
culture


the
<collocation>meiji restoration</collocation>
of
stopped
some
old
ways
and
added
many
new
ones


the
empire
of
japan
was
created
and
it
became
a
very
powerful
nation
and
tried
to
invade
the
countries
next
to
it


it
invaded
and
annexed
kingdom
taiwan
and
