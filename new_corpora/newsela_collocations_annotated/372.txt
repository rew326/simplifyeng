baba
real
birth
name
was
and
his
parents
names
were
and


his
family
lived
in
india
but
they
were
of
persian
descent


today
persia
is
called
iran


they
were
not
hindus
or
muslims
like
most
indians
at
that
time
but
were
of
the
<collocation>zoroastrian religion</collocation>


baba
had
a
normal
childhood
and
liked
poetry
and
sports
especially
cricket

was
thirteen
years
old
he
started
a
boy
club
with

raised
money
to
give
to
the

riding
a

a
very
old
muslim
woman

who

called
for

to
come
over
to
her
and
she
kissed
him
on
the
forehead


he
then
went
home


baba
later
said
that
he
became
so
dazed
after
this
kiss
that
he
could
barely
find
his
way
home
and
that
when
kissed
him
he
realized
god
within
himself


he
was
so
dazed
that
he
had
to
stay
in
bed
for
several
weeks


a
year
later
baba
met
a
hindu
holy
man
named


baba
went
to
live
with
in
the
village
of


he
learned
from
and
obeyed
orders


baba
stayed
with
for
seven
years
until
he
was
twenty
seven
years
old


then
told
some
of
his
followers
that
from
then
on
baba
would
be
their
spiritual
guide


baba
eventually
took
these
new
followers
to
to
a
place
now
called


there
he
gave
lessons
in
spirituality
worked
with
the
poor
and
started
a
free
boarding
school


gradually
other
people
started
to
follow
baba


baba
pointing
to
letters
on
his
alphabet
board
to
communicate
a
letter
for
most
of
his
life
baba
did
not
speak


he
started
his
silence
in


he
communicated
by
pointing
to
letters
painted
on
an
alphabet
board
at
first
and
later
used
his
own
form
of
<collocation>sign language</collocation>


he
kept
silent
until
his
death
in


some
people
called
him
the
silent
master
and
there
is
a
book
by
that
title


baba
traveled
around
the
world
many
times


he
visited
many
countries


he
spent
several
months
in
england
australia
and
the
united
states


many
thousands
of
people
came
to
see
him


some
of
them
became
his
followers


in
when
baba
was
sixty
years
old
he
said
to
others
that
he
was
the
avatar


in
the
ancient
language
of
sanskrit
the
word
avatar
means
one
who
has
come
down
from
god


baba
said
that
the
avatar
is
born
on
earth
every
years
and
comes
to
help
others
find
god


baba
said
that
in
the
past
the
avatar
had
been
on
earth
as
zoroaster
krishna
buddha
jesus
and
muhammad


baba
most
famous
quote
is
do
worry
be
happy
partly
because
it
appeared
in
a
popular
song
by
bobby


others
know
of
him
because
of
the
song
baba
written
by
pete
who
is
a
follower
of
his
and
named
the
song
partly
after
baba


he
wrote
two
important
books


in
discourses
baba
wrote
about
how
to
live
a
good
life
how
to
meditate
and
how
to
love
god


in
<collocation>god speaks</collocation>
baba
wrote
about
how
the
soul
seeks
god
over
many
lifetimes


he
said
real
happiness
lies
in
making
others
happy


he
showed
his
followers
that
the
best
path
is
to
love
god
at
all
times
by
loving
your
fellow
man


he
also
said
he
had
not
come
to
start
a
new
religion
that
it
was
better
to
truly
follow
one
own
religion


because
of
this
he
has
followers
who
are
christians
jews
hindus
muslims
buddhists
and
sikhs


there
are
also
atheists
and
who
do
not
necessarily
believe
in
god
but
who
are
attracted
purely
to
his
simple
philosophy
of
leading
an
honest
and
loving
life

a
great
deal
about
the
show


they
are
usually
called


the
word
was
first
used
by
arthur
when
he
saw
people
wearing
fake
vulcan
ears
at
a
convention
an
event
where
lots
of
people
interested
in
the
same
thing
organise
to
meet
in


some
fans
like
to
be
known
as
trekkers
instead


two
documentaries
factual
television
shows
have
been
made
about
them
called
and


enterprise
in
nasa
made
a
prototype
test
<collocation>space shuttle</collocation>


it
was
first
going
to
be
called
constitution
but
<collocation>star trek</collocation>
fans
wrote
letters
to
nasa
asking
for
it
to
be
called
enterprise
instead


enterprise
was
used
for
flight
tests
although
it
was
never
sent
into
space


it
is
now
displayed
put
on
show
at
the
institution


parodies
and
tributes
the
movie
<collocation>galaxy quest</collocation>
is
a
<collocation>star trek</collocation>
parody
which
means
it
was
made
to
be
like
<collocation>star trek</collocation>
in
a
funny
way


there
have
been
parodies
on
television
in
the
cartoons
futurama
the
and
family
guy


the
video
games
company
<collocation>blizzard entertainment</collocation>
puts
references
to
<collocation>star trek</collocation>
in
many
of
its
games
like
starcraft
and
world
of
warcraft


fans
of
the
show
made
a
new
episode
pilgrim
of
eternity
in


the
crew
were
also
professional
film
and
tv
people


<collocation>themes star</collocation>
trek
episodes
often
tell
a
moral
story


philosophical
and
moral
questions
are
common


in
the
<collocation>star trek</collocation>
voyager
episode
a
transporter
accident
puts
two
characters
and
into
one
body


this
makes
a
new
person
who
has
his
own
personality


the
crew
of
the
voyager
must
decide
what
to
do
they
can
kill
by
separating
him
back
into
and
or
they
can
kill
and
by
letting
live


in
the
end
captain
decides
to
save
and
although
the
doctor
thinks
this
is
wrong


<collocation>star trek</collocation>
episodes
also
often
reflect
copy
what
is
happening
in
the
real
world


one
example
is
the
episode
a
private
little
war
in
<collocation>star trek</collocation>
the
<collocation>original series</collocation>


this
is
said
to
be
like
the
vietnam
war


in
the
episode
the
threaten
innocent
people


captain
kirk
has
to
decide
whether
to
give
the
people
guns
so
that
they
can
defend
themselves


the
episode
asks
whether
you
can
fight
evil
without
doing
evil
yourself


one
focus
of
all
the
<collocation>star trek</collocation>
franchises
is
a
federation
law
called
the
prime
directive


the
prime
directive
states
that
advanced
civilizations
should
not
change
more
primitive
ones
societies
should
be
allowed
to
develop
on
their
own


the
prime
directive
often
makes
for
a
moral
conflict
for
example
the
prime
directive
might
forbid
using
advanced
technology
to
save
an
intelligent
race

a
tunnel
for
car
movement
in
hamburg
germany


a
tunnel
is
an
underground
passage


some
tunnels
are
used
for
cars
and
others
are
used
for
trains


sometimes
a
tunnel
is
used
for
movement
of
ships


some
tunnels
are
built
for
communication
cables
and
some
are
built
for
electricity
cables


other
tunnels
are
built
for
animals

tunnels
tunnels
tunnels
are
dug
in
different
kinds
of
grounds
from
soft
sand
to
hard
rock


the
way
of
digging
is
chosen
by
the
type
of
ground


there
are
two
additional
ways
of
digging
quarry
and
cut
and
cover


in
quarry
the
tunnel
path
is
drilled
in
a
horizontal
way


this
system
requires
a
deep
tunnel
that
built
in
a
firm
rock


in
the
cut
and
cover
system
a
tunnel
is
dug
in
the
ground
and
afterwards
a
roof
is
built
above
the
tunnel


this
system
<collocation>fits tunnels</collocation>
that
are
close
to
the
ground
like
road
tunnels
and
infrastructure


building
tunnels
is
a
large
civil
engineering
project
that
could
cost
very
high
sums
of
money


the
planning
and
building
of
a
long
tunnel
may
take
many
years


the
<collocation>channel tunnel</collocation>
between
france
and
england
is
one
of
the
longest
tunnels
in
the
world


it
is
kilometers
long


the
longest
tunnel
in
the

the

tunnel
is
being
dug
in
