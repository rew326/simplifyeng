jane
december
july
was
an
english
novelist


she
wrote
many
books
of
romantic
fiction
about
the
gentry


her
works
made
her
one
of
the
most
famous
and
<collocation>beloved writers</collocation>
in
english
literature


she
is
one
of
the
great
masters
of
the
english
novel


works
criticized
sentimental
novels
in
the
late
century
and
are
part
of
the
change
to
realism


she
wrote
about
typical
people
in
everyday
life


this
gave
the
english
novel
its
first
distinctly
modern
character


stories
are
often
comic
but
they
also
show
how
women
depended
on
marriage
for
social
standing
and
economic
security


her
works
are
also
about
moral
problems


jane
was
born
on
december
at
near


educated
mostly
by
her
father
and
older
brothers
and
also
by
her
own
reading
she
lived
with
her
family
at


they
moved
to
bath
when
her
father
retired
in


after
he
died
in
she
moved
around
with
her
mother


in
they
settled
in
near
hampshire


in
may
she
moved
to
winchester
to
be
near
her
doctor


she
died
there
on
july


jane
was
very
modest
about
her
own
genius


she
once
famously
described
her
work
as
the
<collocation>little bit</collocation>
two
<collocation>inches wide</collocation>
of
ivory
on
which
i
work
with
so
fine
a
brush
as
produces
little
effect
after
much
labor


when
she
was
a
girl
she
wrote
stories


her
works
were
printed
only
after
much
revision


only
four
of
her
novels
were
printed
while
she
was
alive


they
were
sense
and
sensibility
pride
and
prejudice
park
and
emma


two
other
novels
abbey
and
persuasion
were
printed
in
with
a
biographical
notice
by
her
brother
henry


persuasion
was
written
shortly
before
her
death


she
also
wrote
two
earlier
works
lady
susan
and
an
unfinished
novel
the


she
had
been
working
on
a
new
novel
but
she
died
before
she
could

facts
about
jane
are
famously
scarce
few


only
a
few
letters
remain
it
is
estimated
that
only
out
of
letters
survive


her
<collocation>sister cassandra</collocation>
to
whom
most
of
the
letters
were
written
burned
the
greater
part
of
the
ones
she
kept


the
letters
she
did
not
destroy
she
censored


other
letters
were
destroyed
by
the
heirs
of
admiral
francis
jane
brother


most
of
the
biographies
written
about
her
for
years
after
she
died
was
by
her
relatives
who
often
described
her
as
good
quiet
aunt
jane


scholars
have
not
been
able
to
find
much
information
after
that


family
cassandra
jane
sister
and
best
friend
parents
george
and
his
wife
cassandra
were
both
part
of
the
gentry


cassandra
was
a
part
of
the
important
family


george
however
was
of
a
lower
class
of
society


he
had
first
met
cassandra
at
oxford
while
she
was
meeting
her
<collocation>uncle theophilus</collocation>


george
and
cassandra
married
on
april
at
church
in
bath


had
a
large
family


she
had
six
brothers
james
george
edward
henry
thomas
francis
william
frank
charles
john
and
one
sister
cassandra
elizabeth
who
died
without
marrying


jane
deeply
loved
cassandra
and
they
were
both
best
friends


of
her
brothers
was
most
close
to
henry
who
helped
spread
and
influence
her
writing


oh
what
a
henry


she
once
wrote


george
was
almost
ten
years
older
than
jane


he
suffered
from
fits
and
was
not
able
to
develop
normally


his
father
wrote
of
him
we
have
this
comfort
he
can
not
be
a
bad
or
a
wicked
child


he
may
also
have
been
deaf
and
mute


jane
knew
<collocation>sign language</collocation>
she
mentioned
talking
with
my
fingers
in
a
letter
and
could
have
communicated
with
him


charles
and
frank
served
in
the
navy


edward
was
adopted
by
his
fourth
cousin
thomas
knight


he
became
edward
knight
instead
of
edward
in


early
life
and
education
was
born
on
december
at
rectory


she
was
christened
in
public
on
april


a
few
months
after
she
was
born
her
mother
hired
a
woman
named
elizabeth
to
nurse
her


took
care
of
for
about
a
year


according
to
family
tradition
jane
and
cassandra
were
sent
to
oxford
to
be
educated
by
<collocation>ann crawley</collocation>
in


they
moved
with
her
to
later
in
the
year


both
girls
caught
typhus
and
jane
almost
died


after
that
was
educated
at
home
until
she
went
to
boarding
school
with
cassandra
early
in


she
learned
some
french
spelling
needlework
dancing
music
and
probably
drama


in
the
winter
of
jane
and
cassandra
went
back
home
because
their
family
was
not
rich
enough
to
send
both
of
their
daughters
to
school


then
studied
english
at
bristol
university


she
stayed
in
manor
hall
in
at
that
time


also
learned
much
by
reading
books


her
father
and
brothers
helped
choose
the
books
she
read


george
seemed
to
have
let
his
daughters
read
the
books
in
his
large
library
freely


he
also
allowed
experiments
in
writing
and
gave
her
costly
paper
and
other
writing
materials


jane
and
her
family
also
enjoyed
acting
out
plays
privately


most
of
the
plays
were
comedies


this
might
have
been
a
way
for
comedic
and
satirical
talents
to
develop


early
writings
portrait
of
henry
iv
drawn
by
<collocation>sister cassandra</collocation>


perhaps
from
as
early
as
began
writing
poems
short
stories
and
plays
for
fun


later
put
together
fair
copies
of
of
these
early
works
into
three
notebooks


they
are
now
called
the


it
has
pieces
which
were
first
written
down
between
and


jane
had
arranged
her
writing
during
this
time
into
three
volumes
namely
volume
the
first
volume
the
second
and
volume
the
third


there
is
some
proof
that
continued
to
work
on
these
pieces
later
in
life


her
nephew
and
niece
james
edward
and
anna
may
have
made
further
additions
to
her
work
in
around


in
these
works
were
included
love
and
sic
which
was
completed
in
and
castle
which
was
completed
in


in
love
and
she
laughed
at
popular
sentimental
novels


she
also
wrote
the
history
of
england
which
had
<collocation>watercolor pictures</collocation>
by
her
<collocation>sister cassandra</collocation>
inside
it


death
jane
started
to
feel
increasingly
unwell
during
which
was
the
year
when
her
novel
persuasion
was
published


on
may
she
moved
to
winchester
in
search
for
a
cure
to
her
illness


she
died
on
july
aged


although
there
is
no
conclusive
evidence
to
prove
the
cause
of
her
death
it
seems
likely
that
it
was
addison
disease
that
killed
her
