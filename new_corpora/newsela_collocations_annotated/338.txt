a
calendar
is
a
tool
used
to
decipher
the
time
of
an
event
and
for
planning
things
that
have
not
happened
yet


this
is
done
using
days
called
calendar
dates


the
dates
are
usually
made
based
on
how
things
in
the
sky
seem
to
move


the
year
and
month
are
based
on
motions
of
the
sun
and
moon


by
knowing
what
day
something
happened
or
will
happen
people
have
an
easier
life


calendar
systems
have
a
beginning
time
or
era


the
era
is
often
a
religion
based
event
such
as
the
birth
of
jesus
but
it
may
be
a
political
event
such
as
a
coronation
or
the
founding
of
a
state


dates
that
are
counted
from
the
coronation
are
called


the
japanese
calendar
for
example
uses
both
a
state
era
and
a
monarch
era


the
calendar
most
used
today
is
the
gregorian
calendar


there
are
roughly
calendar
systems
in
use
today
from
many
