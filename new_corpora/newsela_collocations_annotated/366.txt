and
<collocation>margaret beaufort</collocation>


his
father
died
two
months
before

<collocation>uncle jasper</collocation>
tudor


jasper
took
henry
to
france
where
he
spent
most
of
his
youth


henry
had
a
claim
to
the
throne
of
england
but
it
was
not
a
very
good
one
and
he
had
to
wait
a
long
time
for
a
chance
to
take
the
throne


in
a
new
king
came
to
the
throne
in
england
called
richard
iii


king
richard
was
not
popular
with
everyone
because
it
was
thought
that
he
had
stolen
the
throne
from
his
young
nephews
and
had
killed
them


this
gave
henry
the
chance
he
had
been
waiting
for


with
help
from
the
french
he
raised
an
army


they
landed
at
dale
in
close
to
where
henry

been
born

he
was
able
to
gather
more
supporters
on
the
way

series
of
civil
wars
fought
over
the
throne
of
england
between
supporters
of
the
house
of
lancaster
and
supporters
of
the
house
of

both
houses
were
branches
of
the
plantagenet
royal
house
tracing
their
descent
from
king
edward
iii


the
main
reason
for
the
war
was
that
king
edward
iii
had
many
sons
as
shown
in
the
family
tree
below


his
oldest
son
who
is
known
by
the
nickname
the
black
prince
died
first
and
the
throne
passed
to
the
black
prince
son
richard
who
became
king
richard
ii
of
england
in
at
the
age
of
only
ten


he
grew
up
to
be
a
weak
and
unpopular
king
and
one
of
his
actions
was
to
send
his
cousin
henry
into
exile


henry
later
returned
while
richard
was
away
in
ireland
and
took
over
the
country


when
richard
returned
henry
tricked
him
into
giving
himself
up


richard
was
put
in
prison
where
he
died
and
henry
became
king
henry
iv
of
england


although
henry
iv
reigned
until
his
death
and
was
followed
by
his
son
king
henry
v
the
next
king
in
line
king
henry
vi
was
only
a
baby


while
he
was
still
growing
up
the
most
powerful
men
in
the
kingdom
started
quarrelling
over
how
to
run
the
country
and
some
of
them
raised
an
army
to
try
to
take
the
throne


henry
vi
and
his
family
fought
back
and
the
war
between
his
supporters
and
their
enemies
lasted
for
many
years
finally
coming
to
an
end
when
king
henry
of
england
came
to
the
throne
in
on
august
henry
army
defeated
richard
iii
army
at
the
battle
of
field


when
richard
iii
died
in
this
battle
henry
became
king


there
were
other
people
who
had
a
claim
on
the
throne
and
henry
did
his
best
to
stop
them
from
taking
it
from
him
either
by
executing
them
putting
them
in
prison
or
trying
to
make
friends
of
them
as
he
did
with
the
earl
of
lincoln


another
step
he
took
was
to
marry
elizabeth
of
york
the
niece
of
king
richard
iii
who
would
herself
have
been
the
heir
to
the
throne
if
she
had
not
been
a
girl


there
were
also
people
who
pretended
to
be
members
of
the
royal
family
so
that
they
could
try
to
take
the
throne


one
of
these
was
a
little
boy
called
lambert
who
looked
very
like
edward
earl
of


the
real
earl
of
was
henry
prisoner
but
this
did
not
stop
other
people
from
believing
that
lambert
was
him


the
earl
of
lincoln
rebelled
against
king
henry
and
raised
an
army
to
make
lambert
king
thinking
that
he
himself
could
rule
the
country


there
was
a
battle
and
the
earl
of
lincoln
was
killed


lambert
was
captured
but
because
he
was
only
a
child
henry
spared
his
life
and
he
became
a
royal
servant


henry
married
elizabeth
of
york
and
by
this
action
put
an
end
to
the
wars
of
the
roses


they
had
six
children
but
only
four
survived
infancy
