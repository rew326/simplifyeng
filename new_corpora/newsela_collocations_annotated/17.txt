calculus
is
a
branch
of
mathematics
which
helps
us
understand
changes
between
values
that
are
related
by
a
function


for
example
if
you
had
one
formula
telling
how
much
money
you
got
every
day
calculus
would
help
you
understand
related
formulas
like
how
much
money
you
have
in
total
and
whether
you
are
getting
more
money
or
less
than
you
used
to


all
these
formulas
are
functions
of
time
and
so
that
is
one
way
to
think
of
calculus
studying
functions
of
time


there
are
two
different
types
of
calculus


<collocation>differential calculus</collocation>
divides
things
into
small
different
pieces
and
tells
us
how
they
change
from
one
moment
to
the
next
while
integral
calculus
joins
integrates
the
small
pieces
together
and
tells
us
how
much
of
something
is
made
overall
by
a
series
of
changes


calculus
is
used
in
many
different
areas
of
study
such
as
physics
astronomy
biology
engineering
economics
medicine
and
sociology


the
word
calculus
comes
from
the
latin
language
meaning
small
stone

in

and

figured
out
calculus
at
the
same
time
working
separately
from
each
other


newton
wanted
to
have
a
new
way
to
predict
where
to
see
planets
in
the
sky
because
astronomy
had
always
been
a
popular
and
useful
form
of
science
and
knowing
more
about
the
motions
of
the
objects
in
the
night
sky
was
important
for
navigation
of
ships


wanted
to
measure
the
space
area
under
a
curve
a
line
which
is
not
straight


many
years
later
the
two
men
argued
over
who
discovered
it
first


scientists
from
england
supported
newton
but
scientists
from
the
rest
of
europe
supported


most
mathematicians
today
agree
that
both
men
share
the
credit
equally


some
parts
of
modern
calculus
come
from
newton
such
as
its
uses
in
physics


other
parts
come
from
such
as
the
symbols
used
to
write
it


they
were
not
the
first
people
to
use
mathematics
to
describe
the
physical
world
aristotle
and
pythagoras
came
earlier
and
so
did
galileo
who
said
that
mathematics
was
the
language
of
science


but
they
were
the
first
to
design
a
system
that
describes
how
things
change
over
time
and
can
predict
how
they
will
change
in
the
future


the
name
calculus
was
the
latin
word
for
a
small
stone
the
ancient
romans
used
in
counting
and
gambling


the
english
word
calculate
comes
from
the
same
latin
word


<collocation>differential calculus</collocation>
main
<collocation>differential calculus</collocation>
<collocation>differential calculus</collocation>
is
the
process
of
finding
out
the
rate
of
change
of
a
variable
compared
to
another
variable


it
can
be
used
to
find
the
speed
of
a
moving
object
or
the
slope
of
a
curve
figure
out
the
maximum
or
minimum
points
of
a
curve
or
find
answers
to
problems
in
the
electricity
and
magnetism
areas
of
physics
among
many
other
uses


many
amounts
can
be
variables
which
can
change
their
value
unlike
numbers
such
as
or


some
examples
of
variables
are
distance
and
time


the
speed
of
an
object
is
how
far
it
travels
in
a
particular
time


so
if
a
town
is
kilometres
miles
away
and
a
person
in
a
car
gets
there
in
one
hour
they
have
traveled
at
an
average
speed
of
kilometres
miles
per
hour


but
this
is
only
an
average
they
may
have
been
traveling
faster
at
some
times
on
a
highway
and
slower
at
others
at
a
traffic
light
or
on
a
small
street
where
people
live


imagine
a
driver
trying
to
figure
out
a
car
speed
using
only
its
odometer
distance
meter
and
clock
without
a
speedometer


until
calculus
was
invented
the
only
way
to
work
this
out
was
to
cut
the
time
into
smaller
and
smaller
pieces
so
the
average
speed
over
the
smaller
time
would
get
closer
and
closer
to
the
actual
speed
at
a
point
in
time


this
was
a
very
long
and
hard
process
and
had
to
be
done
each
time
people
wanted
to
work
something
out


on
a
curve
two
different
points
have
different
slopes


the
red
and
blue
lines
are
tangents
to
the
curve


a
very
similar
problem
is
to
find
the
slope
how
steep
it
is
at
any
point
on
a
curve


the
slope
of
a
straight
line
is
easy
to
work
out
it
is
simply
how
much
it
goes
up
y
or
vertical
divided
by
how
much
it
goes
across
x
or
horizontal


on
a
curve
though
the
slope
is
a
variable
has
different
values
at
different
points
because
the
line
bends


but
if
the
curve
was
to
be
cut
into
very
very
small
pieces
the
curve
at
the
point
would
look
almost
like
a
very
short
straight
line


so
to
work
out
its
slope
a
straight
line
can
be
drawn
through
the
point
with
the
same
slope
as
the
curve
at
that
point


if
it
is
done
exactly
right
the
straight
line
will
have
the
same
slope
as
the
curve
and
is
called
a
tangent


but
there
is
no
way
to
know
without
very
complicated
mathematics
whether
the
tangent
is
exactly
right
and
our
eyes
are
not
accurate
enough
to
be
certain
whether
it
is
exact
or
simply
very
close


what
newton
and
found
was
a
way
to
work
out
the
slope
or
the
speed
in
the
distance
example
exactly
using
simple
and
logical
rules


they
divided
the
curve
into
an
infinite
number
of
very
small
pieces


they
then
chose
points
on
either
side
of
the
range
they
were
interested
in
and
worked
out
tangents
at
each


as
the
points
moved
closer
together
towards
the
point
they
were
interested
in
the
slope
approached
a
particular
value
as
the
tangents
approached
the
real
slope
of
the
curve


they
said
that
this
particular
value
it
approached
was
the
actual
slope


a
picture
that
shows
what
x
and
x
h
mean
on
the
curve


let
say
we
have
a
function
y
f
x


f
is
short
for
function
so
this
equation
means
y
is
a
function
of
x


this
tells
us
that
how
high
y
is
on
the
<collocation>vertical axis</collocation>
depends
on
what
x
the
<collocation>horizontal axis</collocation>
is
at
that
time


for
example
with
the
equation
y
x
we
know
that
if
x
is
then
y
will
be
if
x
is
then
y
will
be
if
x
is
then
y
will
be


lim
h
f
x
h
f
x
h
if
we
use
y
x
the
derivative
produced
using
this
method
is
x
or
multiplied
by
x


so
we
know
without
having
to
draw
any
tangent
lines
that
at
any
point
on
the
curve
f
x
x
the
derivative
f
x
marked
with
an
apostrophe
will
be
x
at
any
point


this
process
of
working
out
a
slope
using
limits
is
called
differentiation
or
finding
the
derivative


came
to
the
same
result
but
called
h
which
means
a
tiny
amount
of
x


he
called
the
resulting
change
in
f
x
dy
which
means
a
tiny
amount
of
y


notation
is
used
by
more
books
because
it
is
easy
to
understand
when
the
equations
become
more
complicated

mathematicians
have
grown
this
basic
theory
to
make
simple
algebra
rules
which
can
be
used
to
find
the
derivative
of
almost
any
function


main
idea
of
calculus
the
main
idea
in
calculus
is
called
the
fundamental
theorem
of
calculus


this
main
idea
says
that
the
two
calculus
processes
differential
and
integral
calculus
are
opposites


that
is
a
person
can
use
<collocation>differential calculus</collocation>
to
undo
an
integral
calculus
process


also
a
person
can
use
integral
calculus
to
undo
a
<collocation>differential calculus</collocation>
method


this
is
just
like
using
division
to
undo
multiplication
or
addition
to
undo
subtraction


in
a
single
sentence
the
fundamental
<collocation>theorem runs</collocation>
something
like
this
the
derivative
of
the
integral
of
a
function
f
is
the
function
itself


demonstration
of
main
idea
of
calculus
how
to
use
integral
calculus
to
find
areas
the
method
integral
calculus
uses
to
find
areas
of
shapes
is
to
break
the
shape
up
into
many
small
boxes
and
add
up
the
area
of
each
of
the
boxes


this
gives
an
approximation
to
the
area


if
the
boxes
are
made
narrower
and
narrower
then
there
are
more
and
more
of
them
and
the
area
of
all
the
boxes
becomes
very
close
to
the
area
of
the
shape


one
of
the
main
ideas
of
calculus
is
that
we
can
imagine
having
an
infinite
number
of
these
boxes
each
infinitely
narrow
and
then
we
would
have
the
exact
area
of
the
shape


other
uses
of

is
used
to
describe
things
that

a
comet
is
a
ball
of
mostly
ice
that
moves
around
in
outer
space


they
are
often
described
as
dirty
snowballs


they
are
very
different
from
asteroids


in
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
the
orbits
of
comets
go
further
than
pluto


most
are
very
far
away
from
the
sun
but
some
come
near
enough
to
earth
for
us
to
see
at
night


they
have
long
tails
because
the
sun
melts
the
ice


a
comet
tail
does
not
trail
behind
it
but
points
directly
away
from
the
sun
because
it
is
blown
by
the
solar
wind


the
hard
center
of
the
comet
is
the
nucleus


it
is
one
of
the
blackest
things
in
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>

history
of
comets
in
old
times
people
used
to
be
scared
of
comets


they
did
not
know
what
they
were
or
where
they
came
from


some
thought
that
they
were
fireballs
sent
from
demons
or
gods
to
destroy
the
earth


they
said
that
each
time
a
comet
appeared
it
would
bring
bad
luck
with
it


whenever
a
comet
appeared
a
king
would
die


for
example
the
tapestry
shows
the
return
of
comet
and
the
death
of
a
king


comets
were
also
known
to
end
wars
and
thought
to
bring
famine


during
the
renaissance
astronomers
started
to
look
at
comets
with
<collocation>less superstition</collocation>
and
to
base
their
science
on
observations


reasoned
that
comets
did
not
come
from
the
earth
and
his
calculations
showed
that
comets
must
be
six
times
farther
than
the
earth
is
from
the
moon


reasoned
that
some
comets
are
periodic
that
is
they
appear
again
after
a
certain
number
of
years
and
again
and
again


this
led
to
the
first
prediction
of
a
comet
return
comet
named
after
him


<collocation>isaac newton</collocation>
also
studied
comets


he
realized
that
comets
make
around
the
sun
