many

mosques
were
built
mostly
during
the

dynasties


the
arab
plan
was
very
simple
which
did
not
allow
for
much
further
development


this
caused
that
style
of
mosque
to
fall
out
of
favor


central
dome
the
ottomans
began
building
central
dome
mosques
in
the
fifteenth
century


these
mosques
have
a
large
<collocation>dome centered</collocation>
over

there
may
also
be
smaller
domes
which
are
over
the

or

of
the

this
style
was
heavily
influenced
by
the
byzantine
religious
architecture

its
use
of

central
domes

minarets
are

usually
they
are

the

the

in
the
world
is

the

mosques
had

the
most
conservative
islamic
groups
like
still
avoid
building

they
see
them
as

and
unnecessary

encouraged
the
building
of
minarets
as
they
were
supposed
to

towers
on

churches


because
of
this
mosque
architects
used
the
shape
of
the

for
their
minarets


both
the
minaret
and
the
<collocation>bell tower</collocation>
serve
the

before

a

some
mosques
have
several
