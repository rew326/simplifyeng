the
water
cycle
is
the
cycle
that
water
goes
through
on
earth


it
makes
the
rain
clouds
and
most
of
our
weather


water
is
essential
for
life
as
we
know
it


it
is
present
throughout
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
and
was
part
of
the
earth
from
its
formation


the
source
of
the
water
was
the
same
as
the
source

the
water
cycle
first
water
on
the
earth
in
lakes
in
oceans
and
in
the
sea
is
evaporated
by
the
heat
from
the
sun


excess
water
from
plants
is
also
absorbed
into
the
atmosphere
this
process
is
called


then
water
collects
as
water
vapor
in
the
sky


this
makes
clouds


next
the
water
in
the
clouds
gets
cold


this
makes
it
become
liquid
again


this
process
is
called
condensation


then
the
water
falls
from
the
sky
as
rain
snow
sleet
or
hail
which
is
called
precipitation


the
water
then
collects
into
lakes
oceans
or


from
there
it
evaporates
again
and
continues

vapor
is
water
that
is
in

it
is
a
part
of
the
water
cycle


when
liquid
water
is
heated
to

temperature
degrees
celsius
it
all
turns
into
vapor


water
vapor
can
also
be
produced
directly
from

this
is
called

steam
is
water
vapor
but

water


water
vapor
affects
weather
conditions


water
vapor
is
found
in
most
of
the
air


in
the
cold
breathing
out
causes
the
water
vapor
breathed
in
to
freeze


water
vapor
weighs
less
than
air
which
is
part
of
the
reason
clouds
float
high
in
the
sky


water
vapor
is
transparent


the
small

that
look

molecules
are

solid
is
one
of
the
four
common
states
of
matter


the
molecules
in
solids
are
closely
bound
together
they
can
only
vibrate


this
means
solids
have
a
definite
shape
that
only
changes
when
a
force
is
applied


this
is
different
to
liquids
and
gases
which
move
randomly
a
process
called
flow


when
a
solid
becomes
a
liquid
this
is
called
melting


liquids
become
solid
by
freezing


some
solids
like
dry
ice
can
turn
into
gas
without
turning
liquid
first


this
is
called
sublimation

kinds
of
solids
the
forces
between
the
atoms
in
a
solid
can
take
many
forms


for
example
a
crystal
of
<collocation>sodium chloride</collocation>
common
salt
is
made
up
of
<collocation>ionic sodium</collocation>
and
chlorine
which
are
held
together
by
<collocation>ionic bonds</collocation>


in
diamond
or
silicon
the
atoms
share
electrons
and
make
<collocation>covalent bonds</collocation>


in
metals
electrons
are
shared
in
<collocation>metallic bonding</collocation>


some
solids
like
most
organic
compounds
are
held
together
with
van
der
forces
coming
from
the
polarization
of
the
electronic
charge
cloud
on
each
molecule


the
dissimilarities
between
the
types
of
solid
come
from
the
differences
between
their
bonding

mixtures
of
two
or
more
elements
in
which
the

reliability

many
tools

iron
and
aluminium
are
the
two
most
commonly
used
metals


they
are
also
the
most
common
metals
in
the
earth

iron
is
most
commonly
used
in
the
form
of
an
alloy
steel
which
has
up

carbon
making
it
much
harder
than

since
metals
are
good

of

they
are
valuable
in
electrical
tools
and
for
carrying
an
electric
current
over
long
distances
with
little

loss


because
of
this
electrical
power
grids
rely
on
metal
cables
to
get

home
electrical
systems

minerals
a
collection
of
different
minerals


minerals
are
natural
solids
formed
through
many
geological
processes
under
high
pressures


to
be
thought
as
a
true
mineral
a
substance
must
have
a
<collocation>crystal structure</collocation>
with
uniform
physical
things
throughout


minerals
differ
in
composition
from
pure
elements
and
simple
salts
to
very
complex
silicates
with
thousands
of
known
forms


in
contrast
a
rock
sample
is
a
random
aggregate
of
minerals
and
has
no
specific
chemical
composition


most
of
the
rocks
of
the
earth
crust
have
quartz
crystalline
feldspar
mica
calcite
hematite
and
a
few
other
minerals


some
minerals
like
quartz
mica
or
feldspar
are
common
while
others
have
been
found
in
only
a
few
places
in
the
world


the
largest
group
of
minerals
by
far
is
the
silicates
most
rocks
are
silicates
which
are
made
largely
of
silicon
and
oxygen

a
simple
picture
explaining
the
evaporation
of
water
though
in
real
life
you
can
not
see
the
water
but
only
<collocation>steam evaporation</collocation>
is
when
a
liquid
becomes
a
gas


when
the
molecules
in
a
liquid
are
heated
they
move
faster


this
makes
them
full
of
energy
and
so
the
particles
collide
with
each
other
and
eventually
they
become
so
far
apart
that
they
become
a
gas


for
example
a
water
left
in
a
bowl
will
slowly
disappear


the
water
evaporates
into
water
vapor
the
gas
phase
of
water


the
water
vapor
mixes
with
the
air


evaporation
is
a
type
of
phase
change
in
which
matter
changes
from
a
liquid
to
a
gas


some
liquids
evaporate
more
quickly
than
others


liquid
with
high
boiling
points
those
that
boil
at
very
high
temperatures
tend
to
evaporate
more
slowly
than
those
with
lower
boiling
temperatures


<collocation>water boils</collocation>
at
around
degrees
celsius


<collocation>boiling point</collocation>
of
water
there
are
many
factors
that
affect
the
evaporation
rate


different
liquids
evaporate
at
different
temperatures


for
example
aluminum
evaporates
at
degrees
celsius


when
water
is
evaporating
it
transforms
into
a
gas
called
water
vapor


the
reverse
of
evaporation
is
condensation


evaporation
is
a
very
essential
part
of
the
water
cycle


when
water
is
boiling
in
a
closed
container
sometimes
evaporation
happens
at
the
same
time
as
condensation


process
in
nature
evaporation
is
vital
in
nature
and
is
always
the
same
as
temperature
and
<collocation>vapor pressure</collocation>
in
nature


this
means
that
if
there
is
a
lot
of
evaporation
the
temperature
goes
down


alternatively
if
there
is
hardly
any
evaporation
there
will
be
a
temperature
increase


the
rate
of
evaporation
are
affected
by
the
liquid
exposed
surface
area
faster
when
increased
the
humidity
of
surroundings
slower
when
increased
the
presence
of

a
contract
is
a
legal
agreement
or
promise
between
two

more
people


a
contract
is
an
agreement
or
promise
that
the
law
can
enforce


the
law
will
enforce
some
agreements
but
not
others


for
example
in
most
places
if
a
<collocation>parent promises</collocation>
to
take
a
child
to
get
<collocation>ice cream</collocation>
the
law
will
not
enforce
that

legal
contract


the
legal
rules
about
which
promises
are
enforced
by
the
law
can
be
different
in
different
places
or
jurisdictions
but
a
contract
is
usually
enforced
only
if
it
is
made
by
people
or
groups
who
want
it
to
be
enforced
and
who
know
what
they
are
doing


sometimes
a
contract
is
written
down
and
signed
by
the
people
agreeing
to
it
but
it
does
not
always
need
to
be


people
usually
sign
a
contract
when
something
important
or
costly
is
being
done


for
example
when
people
take
a
job
they
will
sometimes
sign
a
contract
with
their
employers


the
contract
will
show
what
the
person
must
do
as
part
of
his
job
how
much
they
will
be
paid
and
so
on


the
person
and
the
employer
will
sign
the
contract
and
it
will
become
a
legal
promise


if
someone
breaks
a
contract
another
person
might
sue
him
or
her


in
a
lawsuit
about
a
contract
the
court
will
look
at
the
contract
listen
to
what
the
people
who
made
the
contract
say
about
it
and
then
make
a

the
british
in
the
late
century
wanted
to
build
a
fort
near


this
was
to
become
more
powerful
than
dutch
the
portuguese
and
the
french


in
the
british
completed
the
construction
of
old
fort
william
which
was
used
to
station
its
troops
and
as
a
regional
base


calcutta
was
declared
a
presidency
city
and
later
became
the
headquarters
of
the
bengal
presidency


when
regular
fights
with
french
forces
started
in
the
british
began
to
upgrade
their
fortifications


when
this
was
protested
the
nawab
of

this
led

<collocation>reed pen</collocation>
used
by
ancient
egyptians
who
wrote
with
ink
on
sheets
of
papyrus
paper


another
early
writing
instrument
was
the
stylus
which
was
a
thin
metal
stick
often
made
from
lead


it
was
used
for
scratching
onto
wood
covered
with
was
a
method
used
by
the
romans


the
word
pencil
comes
from
the
latin
word

which
means
little

it
is
an
invention
of

in
england


discovery
of
<collocation>graphite deposits</collocation>
some
time
before
it
may
have
been
as
early
as
an
enormous
deposit
of
graphite
was
discovered
in


the
locals
found
that
it
was
very
useful
for
marking
sheep


this
particular
deposit
of
graphite
was
extremely
pure
and
solid
and
it
could
easily
be
sawn
into
sticks


this
is
still
the
only
<collocation>large scale</collocation>
deposit
of
graphite
ever
found
in
this
solid
form


chemistry
was
in
its
infancy
and
the
substance
was
thought
to
be
a
form
of
lead


consequently
it
was
called
latin
for
lead
ore


the
black
core
of
pencils
is
still
referred
to
as
lead
even
though
it
never
contained
the
element
lead


the
value
of
graphite
was
soon
realized
mainly
because
it
could
be
used
to
line
the
moulds
for
cannonballs


the
mines
were
taken
over
by
the
crown
and
guarded


when
sufficient
stocks
of
graphite
had
been
accumulated
the
mines
were
flooded
to
prevent
theft
until
more
was
required


graphite
had
to
be
smuggled
out
for
use
in
pencils


because
graphite
is
soft
it
requires
some
form
of
holder


<collocation>graphite sticks</collocation>
were
at
first
wrapped
in
string
or
in
sheepskin
for
stability


the
news
of
the
usefulness
of
these
early
pencils
spread
far
and
wide
attracting
the
attention
of
artists
all
over
the
known
world


england
continued
to
have
a
monopoly
on
the
production
of
pencils
until
a
method
of
reconstituting
the
graphite
powder
was
found


the
distinctively
square
english
pencils
continued
to
be
made
with
sticks
cut
from
natural
graphite
into
the


the
town
of
near
the
original
findings
of
block
graphite
has
a
pencil
museum


the
first
attempt
to
<collocation>manufacture graphite</collocation>
sticks
from
<collocation>powdered graphite</collocation>
was
in
germany
in


it
used
a
mixture
of
graphite
sulphur
and
antimony


residual
graphite
from
a
pencil
stick
is
not
poisonous
and
graphite
is
harmless
if
consumed
