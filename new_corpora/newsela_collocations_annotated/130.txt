the
matter
of
uninstalling
the

of

has
shipped
with

remains
a
controversial
one


the
idea
of
removing
a
stock
install
of
<collocation>internet explorer</collocation>
from
a
windows
system
was
proposed
during
the
united
states
court
case


one
of
arguments
during
the
trial
was
that
removing
<collocation>internet explorer</collocation>
from
windows
may
result
in
system
instability


removing
<collocation>internet explorer</collocation>
does
have
a
number
of
consequences


applications
that
depend
on
libraries
installed
by
ie
will
fail
to
function
or
have
<collocation>unexpected behaviors</collocation>


the
windows
help
and
support
system
will
also
not
function
due
to
the
<collocation>heavy reliance</collocation>
on
help
files
and
components
of
ie


in
versions
of
windows
before
vista
it
is
also
not
possible
to
run
windows
update
or
update
with
any
other
browser
due
to
the
service
implementation
of
an
control
which
no
other
browser
supports


in
<collocation>windows vista</collocation>
windows
update
is
implemented
as
a
<collocation>control panel</collocation>


with
windows
added
the
ability
to
safely
remove
<collocation>internet explorer</collocation>
from
windows


does
not
allow
the
dependencies
to
be
removed
through
this
process
but
the

is

the
platypus
is
a
small
mammal
of
the
order


it
lives
in
eastern
australia


it
lives
in
rivers
and
on
river
banks


it
is
one
of
only
two
families
of
mammals
which
lay
eggs


the
other
is
the
echidna
which
has
four
species


the
platypus
was
first
described
in
detail
in
the
early
century
but
it
took
a
while
before
biologists
in
england
believed
what
they
were
reading


these
mammals
are
called
because
they
have
a
common
rear
opening
known
as
the
cloaca


through
this
opening
faeces
and
urine
are
voided
put
out
and
sexual
activity
takes
place


this
is
a
primitive
basal
feature
of
tetrapods
which
birds
and
reptiles
have
today


the
more
advanced
derived
mammals
have
the
system
where
the
rear
has
two
openings


the
plural
of
platypus
is
just
platypus

what
sort
of
animal
is
it


the
platypus
looks
similar
to
a
beaver
with
a
brown
furry
body
and
wide
flat
tail


unlike
a
beaver
it
has
webbed
feet
joined
toes
which
are
good
for
swimming


its
nose
is
large
and
rubbery


the
platypus
is
sometimes
called
duck
billed
platypus
because
of
this
nose


it
is
similar
to
a
duck
bill
mouth


can
be
big
or
small


the
larger
platypus
live
in
while
the
smaller
ones
live
in


adults
can
be
less
than
convert
kg
lb
on
on
or
up
to
convert
kg
lb
on
on


its
body
can
be
from
convert
cm
in
on
on
to

in
on
on
long


its
tail
can
be
from

on
to

males
are
about
larger
than
females


the
male
platypus
has
a
<collocation>sharp spine</collocation>
on
his
two
back
legs
called
ankle
spurs
which
contain
a
mild
poison


it
will
not
kill
humans
but
the
poison
has
been
known
to
kill
small
animals
such
as
dogs
and
cause
pain
lasting
as
long
as
four
months


the
amount
of
poison
increases
during
the
breeding
season


how
platypus
live
the
<collocation>platypus sleeps</collocation>
during
the
day


it
moves
mostly
at
night


it
is
a
very
good
swimmer
and
spends
much
of
its
time
in
the
water


the
toes
on
its
feet
are
joined


when
it
swims
it
pushes
itself
along
by
moving
the
front
two
feet


the
tail
and
back
feet
help
it
to
turn
left
or
right
but
does
not
make
it
faster


the
platypus
eats
other
animals


it
eats
worms
insect
larvae
which
are
insect
babies
<collocation>freshwater shrimp</collocation>
and
which
are
a
kind
of
freshwater
crayfish


it
digs
these
animals
out
of
the
bottom
of
the
river
with
its
nose
or
catches
them
while
swimming


its
nose
can
sense
many
things
that
other
animal
noses
can
not


the
platypus
can
sense
electricity
from
other
animals


it
keeps
its
eyes
shut
when
swimming
using
only
its
other
senses
such
as
hearing
touch
and
changes
in
the
electrical
field


no
other
mammal
can
do
this


the
platypus
can
also
hunt
without
using
its
eyes


these
are
adaptations
to
life
in
rivers
where
the
water
is
opaque
with
sediment


reproduction
when
on
land
the
platypus
lives
in
a
short
straight
oval
holes
like
a
rabbit
burrows


these
holes
are
between
convert
m
ft
on
on
and
convert
m
ft
on
on
long


it
makes
these
holes
in
the
river
bank
a
little
above
the
water


it
likes
them
hidden
under
roots


when
a
female
platypus
is
pregnant
the
female
makes
much
larger
holes
up
to
convert
m
ft
on
on
long


she
blocks
the
tunnel
with
earth
at
several
places


at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
she
builds
a
nest
out
of
reeds
for
her
eggs


the
platypus
lays
eggs
in
its
nest


when
the
babies
come
out
of
the
eggs
after
about
ten
days
they
hold
on
to
the
mother


the
mother
makes
milk
for
the
new
babies
