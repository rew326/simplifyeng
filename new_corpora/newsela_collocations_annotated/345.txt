mediterranean
sea
the
mediterranean
sea
is
the
body
of
water
that
separates
europe
africa
and
asia


the
mediterranean
sea
is
connected
to
the
atlantic
ocean
by
a
narrow
passage
called
the
strait
of
gibraltar


it
is
between
the
southern
tip
of
spain
and
northern


it
is
almost
completely
surrounded
by
land
on
the
north
by
europe
on
the
south
by
north
africa
and
on
the
east
by
the
middle
east


it
covers
around
million
km
mi


to
the
east
it
connects
to
the
sea
of
and
the
black
sea
by
the
and
the
bosporus


the
sea
of
is
often
thought
to
be
a
part
of
the
mediterranean
sea
whereas
the
black
sea
is
generally
not


the
km
mi
long
<collocation>suez canal</collocation>
in
the
southeast
connects
the
mediterranean
sea
to
the
red
sea


the
canal
is
between
egypt
and
the
peninsula


it
was
built
by
the
french
compagnie
du
canal
maritime
de
suez
from
to
against
the
british
government


as
a
sea
around
which
some
of
the
most
ancient
human
civilizations
were
arranged
history
some
of
the
most
ancient
human
civilisations
were
made
around
the
mediterranean
sea
so
it
has
had
a
large
influence
on
the
history
and
ways
of
life
of
these
cultures


it
provided
a
way
of
trade
colonization
and
war
and
was
the
basis
of
life
like
fishing
and
catching
other
seafood
for
many
communities
throughout
the
ages


the
combination
of
similarly
shared
climate
geology
and
access
to
a
common
sea
has
led
to
lots
of
historical
and
cultural
connections
between
the
ancient
and
modern
societies
around
the
mediterranean


above
all
it
was
the
<collocation>super highway</collocation>
of
transport
in
ancient
times


it
allowed
for
trade
and
cultural
exchange
between
peoples
of
the
region
phoenicians
egyptians
greeks
romans
and
the
middle
east
arab
persian
semitic
cultures


the
history
of
the
mediterranean
is
important
in
understanding
the
origin
and
development
of
western
civilization


in
modern
times
the
mediterranean
was
the
location
of
many
battles
at
sea
during
<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii
and
control
over
it
was
important
for
defeating
the
<collocation>axis powers</collocation>
nazi
germany
and
fascist
italy


today
the
mediterranean
sea
still
connects
the
economies
of
europe
north
africa
and
the
middle
east
as
it
did
in
ancient
times


oceanography
being
nearly
landlocked
affects
the
mediterranean
sea
properties


tides
are
limited
by
the
narrow
connection
with
the
atlantic
ocean


the
water
is
saltier
partly
because
of
evaporation


the
mediterranean
has
a
deep
blue
color


evaporation
greatly
exceeds
precipitation
and
river
runoff
in
the
mediterranean
a
fact
that
is
central
to
the
water
circulation
within
the
basin


evaporation
is
especially
high
in
its
eastern
half
causing
the
water
level
to
decrease
and
salinity
to
increase
eastward


this
pressure
gradient
pushes
relatively
cool
water
from
the
atlantic
across
the
basin
it
warms
and
becomes
saltier
as
it
travels
east
then
sinks
in
the
region
of
the
levant
and
circulates
westward
to
spill
over
the
strait
of
gibraltar


thus
<collocation>seawater flow</collocation>
is
eastward
in
the
strait
surface
waters
and
westward
below
once
in
the
atlantic
this
chemically
distinct
mediterranean
intermediate
water
can
persist
thousands
of
kilometers
away
from
its
source

c
are
kept
close
to
the
design
of
the
computer
the
compiler
program
builder
can
generate
instructions
for
the
computer
that
will
run
very
fast


this
makes
c
a
good
language
for
writing
<collocation>operating systems</collocation>


many
<collocation>operating systems</collocation>
including
and
unix
are
programmed
using
this
language


the
language
itself
has
very
few
keywords
and
most
things
are
done
using
libraries
which
are
collections
of
code
for
them
to
be
reused


c
is
available
for
many
different
types
of
computers


this
is
why
c
is
called
a
portable
language


a
program
that
is
written
in
c
and
that
respects
certain
limitations
can
be
compiled
for
many
different
platforms


the
syntax
of
c
has
also
