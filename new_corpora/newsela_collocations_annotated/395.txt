printers
are
programmed
using

interprets

there
are
two

of
such
languages
page

languages


a

language
describes

contain

common
programming
languages
for

include
postscript
and
cost
of
printers
there
are
different
costs
with
a
printer


printers
that
are
more
expensive
to
buy
will
usually
be
less
expensive
in
the
consumables
the
ink
toner
or
ribbon
used
by
the
printer


therefore
<collocation>laser printers</collocation>
are
often
more
expensive
to
buy
than
printers
but
are
not
expensive
to
use
over
a
long
period
of
time


printers
on
the
other
hand
have
a
higher
cost
of
consumables
because
the
ink
tanks
they
use
are
more
expensive
than
the
toner
for
a
<collocation>laser printer</collocation>


<collocation>laser printers</collocation>
that
can
print
in
color
are
usually
more
expensive
than
those
that
only
print

on
both
sides
of

up

it

the

is
in
the

mountains
of

south

it
flows
east
from
there
to
the
atlantic
ocean


most
of
the
huge
river
and
its
many
tributaries
are
in
the
country
of
brazil


there
are
many
places
on
the

where
a
person
on

side
of
the

can
not
see

characteristic

the

the

of

the
estuary
also
includes
the
island
of
which
lies
in

mouth
of
the
amazon


this
means
that
the
amazon
is
wider
at
its
mouth
than
the
entire
length
of
the
thames
in
england


along
the
coastline
near
do
there
are
many
islands
partially
covered
with
water


there
are
also
sandbanks


the
tides
of
the
atlantic
generate
a
wave
that
reaches
into
the
amazon
river


this
wave
goes
along
the
coast
for
about
convert
km
mi
off


the
phenomenon
of
this
wave
generated
by

tides
is
called
tidal
bore


locally
it
is
known
as


the
occurs
where
the
water
is

than

m
ft
on
deep


it
starts
with
a
<collocation>loud noise</collocation>
and
advances
at
a
speed
of
mph


the
bore
is
the
reason
the
amazon
does
not
have
a
delta


the
ocean
rapidly
carries
away
the
large
amount
of
silt
brought
by
the
amazon


this
makes
it
impossible
for
a
delta
to
grow
past
the
shoreline


it
also
has
a
very
large
tide
that
can
reach
convert
m

off


the
place
has
become
popular
for
river
surfing


a
phenomenon
that
is
very
similar
occurs
at
the
mouth
of
the


bridges
there
are
no
bridges
across
the
entire
length
of
the
river


this
is
not
because
the
river
would
be
too
wide
to
bridge
for
most
of
its
length
engineers
could
build
a
bridge
across
the
river
easily


for
most
of
its
course
the
river
flows
through
the
<collocation>amazon rainforest</collocation>


there
are
very
few
roads
and
cities


most
of
the
time
the
crossing
can
be
done
by
a
ferry
so
there
is
no
need
to
build
a
bridge
