better
and
protection
as
well
as
being
associated
with
good

swimming


this
is
because

from
having
a
plaster
white
bottom
that
reflects
the
blue
sky

meaning
of
purple
purple
is
used
to
represent
royalty


it
is
a
sign
of
power
nobility
luxury
and
ambition


it
shows
wealth
and
extravagance


it
is
thought
as
a
royal
color
because
in
roman
times
there
was
only
one
way
to
make
the
color
purple
which
the
romans
called


they
used
one
or
two
species
sea
snails
of
the
family
which
produced
the
dye
in
a
gland


these
shellfish
came
from
the
mediterranean
sea


each
snail
produced
only
tiny
amounts
so
not
much
of
it
was
made
and
it
was
very
expensive


therefore
purple
was
only
worn
by
the
rich
and
famous


naturally
the
richest
and
most
famous
people
in
the
country
were
the
king
and
queen
so
they
were
able
to
wear
the
most
purple


purple
is
associated
with
wisdom
dignity
independence
creativity
mystery
and
magic


purple
is
a
very
rare
color
in
nature
though
the
<collocation>lavender flower</collocation>
is
an
example


light
purple
is
a
good
choice
for
a
feminine
design


it
creates
feelings
of
romance


bright
purple
can
be
used
when
promoting
children
things


dark
purple
may
create
sad
feelings


it
can
cause
frustration
