the
law
is
a
set
of
rules
that
people
are
made
to
follow
by
the
state


the
courts
and
police
enforce
this
system
of
rules
and
punish
people
who
break
the
laws
such
as
by
making
them
pay
a
fine
or
other
penalty
or
sending
them
to
jail


in
ancient
societies
laws
were
written
by
leaders
to
set
out
rules
on
how
people
can
live
work
and
do
business
with
each
other


today
in
most
countries
laws
are
written
and
voted
on
by
groups
of
elected
politicians
in
a
legislature
such
as
a
parliament
or
congress


to
follow
the
laws
of
a
society
is
to
do
legal
things


an
activity
is
illegal
if
it
breaks
a
law
or
does
not
follow
the
laws


a
legal
code
is
a
written
code
of
laws
that
are
enforced


this
may
deal
with
things
like
police
courts
or
punishments


a
lawyer
jurist
or
attorney
is
a
professional
who
studies
and
argues
the

two
kinds
of
attorneys
transactional
attorneys
who
write
contracts
and
litigators
who
go
to
court


in
the
<collocation>united kingdom</collocation>
these
professionals
are
called
solicitors
and
barristers
respectively


the
rule
of
law
is
the
law
which
says
that
government
can
only
legally
use
its
power
in
a
way
the
government
and
the
people
agree
on


it
limits
the
powers
a
government
has
as
agreed
in
a
country
constitution


the
rule
of
law
prevents
dictatorship
and
protects
the
rights
of
the
people


when
leaders
enforce
the
legal
code
honestly
even
on
themselves
and
their
friends
this
is
an
example
of
the
rule
of
law
being
followed


the
rule
of
law
wrote
the
ancient
greek
philosopher
aristotle
in
is
better
than
the
rule
of
any
individual


culture
is
usually
a
major
source
of
the
principles
behind
many
laws
as
people
tend
to
trust
the
ideas
based
on
family
and
social
habits


in
many
countries
throughout
history
religion
and
religious
books
like
the
bible
or
the
koran
have
been
a

of

civil
law
and
common
law
civil
law
is
the
legal
system
used
in
most
countries
around
the
world
today


civil
law
is
based
on
legislation
that
is
found
in
constitutions
or
statutes
passed
by
government


the
secondary
part
of
civil
law
is
the
legal
approaches
that
are
part
of
custom


in
civil
law
governments
judges
do
not
generally
have
much
power
and
most
of
the
laws
and
<collocation>legal precedent</collocation>
are
created
by
members
of
parliament


common
law
is
based
on
the
decisions
made
by
judges
in
past
court
cases


it
comes
from
england
and
it
became
part
of
almost
every
country
that
once
belonged
to
the
british
empire
except
scotland
and
the
canadian
province
of
quebec


it
is
also
the
predominant
form
of
law
in
the
united
states
where
many
laws
called
statutes
are
written
by
congress
but
many
more
legal
rules
exist
from
the
decisions
of
the
courts


common
law
had
its
beginnings

document
called
the

countries
such
as
<collocation>saudi arabia</collocation>
and
iran
the
whole
legal
systems
still
base
their
law
on
sharia
law


islamic
law
is
often
criticised
because
it
often
has
harsh
penalties
for
crimes


a
serious
criticism
is
the
judgement
of
the
european
court
that
sharia
is
incompatible
with
the
<collocation>fundamental principles</collocation>
of
democracy


the
turkish
party
plurality
of
legal
systems
grounded
on
religion
was
ruled
to
contravene
the
european
convention
for
the
protection
of
<collocation>human rights</collocation>
and
fundamental
freedoms


the
court
decided
plan
would
do
away
with
the
state
role
as
the
guarantor
of
individual
rights
and
freedoms
and
infringe
the
principle
of
between
individuals

enjoyment
of
public
freedoms

is
one
of
the
<collocation>fundamental principles</collocation>

common

polish


his

spoke
russian

a
leap
year
comes
once
every
four
years


it
is
a
year
in
which
an
extra
day
is
added
to
the

calendar
which
is
used
by
most
of
the

this
extra
day
is
called
a
leap
day


in

year
january

all
start
on
the
same
day
of
the
week


in
a
leap
year
february
starts
and
ends
on
the

a
leap
year
can
always
be
evenly
divided
by
four


for
example
was
a
leap
year


but
a
year
is
not
a
leap
year
if
it
can
be
evenly
divided
by
but
can
not
also
be
evenly
divided
by


this
is
why
and
are
leap
years
but
and
were
not


we
have
leap
years
because
instead
of
days
the
earth
really
takes
a
few
minutes
less
than
days
to
go
completely
around
the
sun


without
leap
years
the
seasons
would
start
one
day
earlier
on
the
calendar
every
four
years


after
years
spring
which
usually
begins
on
march
would
begin
on
december
which
is
when
winter
presently
begins


a
number
of
countries
use
a
lunar
calendar
based
on
the
moon


they
have
leap
years
when
they
add
an
extra
lunar
month


different
calendars
add
the
extra
month
in
different
ways
