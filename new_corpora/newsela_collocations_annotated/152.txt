nim
is
a
simple
game
used
for
examples
in
game
theory


the
rules
of
nim
are
simple
the
game
begins
with
some
piles
of
counters


players
<collocation>alternate turns</collocation>


on
a
turn
a
player
takes
counters
from
a
pile


at
least
one
counter
must
be
taken


all
counters
must
be
in
the
same
pile


if
a
player
can
not
take
a
counter
that
player
loses


there
is
a
simple
mathematical
strategy
to
play
the
game
perfectly


if
both
players
play
perfectly
the
winner
is
determined
by
the

murder
is
when
one
person
kills
another
person
on
purpose


it
is
only
called
murder
when
it
is
against
the
law


if
a
person
does
something
that
makes
someone
else
die
it
is
often
known
as
manslaughter
or
homicide


this
is
true
if
it
was
an
accident


sometimes
a
death
caused
by
someone
else
may
not
be
a
crime


for
example
in
some
situations
killing
may
be


a
person
who
commits
murder
is
called
a
murderer


the
<collocation>legal definition</collocation>
of
murder
and
manslaughter
may
be
different
in
different
countries
and
is
very
much
argued
on
for
example
killing
in
war
is
not
usually
called
murder
by
those
who
take
place
in
the
war


killing
in
self
defense
if
people
being
attacked
kill
someone
who
is
attacking
them
is
not
usually
murder


assassination
assassination
is
a
word
which
means
murdering
someone
for
a
reason


the
word
is
most
used
when
the
person
who
was
killed
was
a
famous
celebrity
or
was
a
person
involved
in
politics


the
people
who
carry
out
assassinations
are
called
assassins
or


an
assassin
may
murder
someone
for
political
reasons
for
money
or
for
other
reasons
such
as
favors
owed
and
revenge


the
word
assassin
comes
from
a
muslim
group
that
was
active
in
the
middle
east
from
the
to
the
centuries


this
secret
society
killed
people
for
political
and
religious
reasons


it
is
thought
that
the
assassins
were
under
the
influence
of
hashish
and
opium
during
their
killings
or
during
their
training


the
word
assassin
comes
from
either
the
influence
of
the
drugs
or
after
their
leader


the

assassination
in

birds
are
a
class
of
vertebrates
the


they
are
and
lay
eggs


their
bodies
are
covered
with
feathers
and
they
have
wings


feathers
have
three
functions
flight
temperature
regulation
and
display


most
birds
have
hollow
main
bones
with
air
sacs
in
them


this
makes
them
lighter
and
makes
flight
easier


birds
are
bipedal
they
have
two
legs
which
are
often
covered
with
scales
small
flat
plates
which
in
the
same
way
as
feathers


they
have
a
hard
beak
with
no
teeth


because
birds
keep
a
high
body
temperature
they
use
lots
of
energy


so
they
need
to
eat
a
lot
of
food
compared
with
their
weight


more
than
different
species
of
birds
are
known


birds
are
found
on

of
the

birds
of

types
of
birds
eat
different
foods


most
birds
are
carnivorous
meaning
that
they
eat
flesh
at
least
some
of
the
time


many
birds
live
on
insects
or
on
fish


some
eat
small
reptiles
and
mice


birds
of
prey
eat
mammals
and
other
birds


some
birds
are
scavengers
and
eat
the
bodies
of
creatures
that
have
died


many
birds
such
as
parrots
and
finches
live
on
seeds
and
fruit


some
birds
that
eat
mainly
seeds
feed
their
young
on
insects


a
few
types
of
birds
eat
green
plants
but
only
one
species
lives
on
leaves


hummingbirds
and
live
on
the
nectar
or
honey
in
flowers


birds
come
in
many
sizes
from
the
bee
hummingbird
that
is
only
mm
long
to
the
ostrich
which
stands
metres
high


the
bird
with
the
widest
wingspan
is
the
wandering
albatross
many
of
which
measure
metres

all
this
applies
to
living
birds


birds
are
the
descendants

body
shape
because
birds
live
on
every
continent
and
have
adapted
to
all
sorts
of
conditions
different
types
of
birds
look
very
different
from
each
other


the
most
noticeable
differences
are
the
size
the
shape
of
the
beak
the
length
of
the
legs
the
length
of
the
neck
and
the
color


the
smallest
types
of
birds
are
tiny
birds
that
feed
on
nectar
honey
and
insects


the
biggest
birds
are
<collocation>flightless birds</collocation>
with
long
legs
ostriches
emus
and


however
very
large
birds
are
also
found
soaring
high
in
the
sky
eagles
vultures
albatross
and
pelicans


one
way
to
understand
the
living
habits
of
a
bird
is
to
look
at
its
legs
and
feet
its
beak
its
neck
and
its
wings


if
a
bird
has
very
long
legs
then
it
probably
spends
most
of
its
time
walking
like
a
crane
or
wading
walking
in
water
like
a
flamingo


birds
with
long
legs
need
long
necks
to
match
so
they
can
reach
their
food


birds
with
short
legs
and
long
necks
like
pelicans
geese
and
swans
are
birds
that
swim
well
and
dive
their
heads
into
the
water
for
food


their
beaks
are
often
flat
for
scooping
up
water
weeds


a
pelican
beak
can
change
into
a
shape
like
a
huge
bucket
for
catching
fish


birds
that
are
shaped
like
torpedoes
are
good
at
diving


albatross
seagulls
and
all
have
long
strong
beaks
for
catching
fish


some
birds
such
as
eagles
<collocation>owls vultures</collocation>
and
hawks
have
beaks
which
are
hooked
and
very
large
claws
also
called
talons
with
which
they
can
tear
and
carry
meat


some
birds
have
very
long
thin
beaks
that
they
use
for
dipping
into
flowers
or
poking
into
holes
in
the
ground


these
include
hummingbirds
bee
eaters
and


some
birds
have
short
beaks
but
wide
mouths
that
are
perfect
for
catching
insects
in
the
air
like
swallows
swifts
and
nightjars


some
birds
that
eat
fruit
like
toucans
and
hornbills
have
beaks
which
are
enormous
but
are
very
light
in
weight


the
<collocation>curved beaks</collocation>
of
parrots
are
good
for
eating
large
seeds
and
cracking
nuts
while
birds
that
peck
small
seeds
and
food
from
the
ground
have
short
beaks
like
pigeons


an
ostrich
has

long
legs

bird
colors
birds
come
in
a
huge
range
of
colors


these
colors
can
be
useful
to
a
bird
in
two
ways


camouflage
colors
help
to
hide
the
bird
and
bright
colors
identify
the
bird
to
others
of
the
same
species


often
the
male
is
brightly
colored
while
the
female
is
camouflaged

grey
partridge
this
owl
is
almost
invisible
against
the
tree
many
birds
are
brown
green
or
gray


these
colors
make
a
bird
harder
to
see
they
camouflage
the
bird


brown
is
the
most
common
color


brown
birds
include
sparrows
emus
larks
eagles
falcons
and
the
female
birds
of
many
species
such
as
wrens
ducks
blackbirds
and
peacocks


when
a
brown
bird
is
in
long
grass
or
among
tree
trunks
or
rocks
it
is
camouflaged


birds
that
live
in
long
grass
often
have
brown
feathers
streaked
with
black
which
looks
like
shadows


a
bittern
is
almost
invisible
in
long
reeds


other
birds
including
starlings
and
are
quite
dark
in
color
but
are
flecked
with
little
spots
that
look
like
raindrops
on
leaves


many
birds
from
hot
countries
are
green
or
have
some
green
feathers
particularly
parrots


birds
that
live
in
green
trees
often
have
green
backs
even
if
they
have
breasts


from
the
back
the
birds
are
camouflaged


this
is
very
useful
when
sitting
on
a
nest


the
bird
breast
is
hidden


are
bred
in
different
colors
such
as
blue
white
and
mauve
but
in
the
wild
they
are
nearly
all
green
and
yellow


even
though
they
fly
very
well
they
normally
spend
a
lot
of
time
on
the
ground
eating
grass
seeds


their
yellow
and
black
striped
back
helps
to
hide
them
in
the
shadows
made
by
long
dry
grass
while
their
green
breasts
are
a
similar
color
to
the
leaves
of
gum
trees


grey
birds
include
most
pigeons
and
doves
cranes
storks
and
herons


grey
birds
are
often
birds
like
pigeons
or
birds
that
sit
on
dead
tree
trunks
looking
like
a
broken
branch


water
birds
like
herons
often
have
a
pale
gray
color
which
makes
it
harder
for
a
fish
to
notice
that
the
bird
is
standing
looking
down
for
something
to
catch


water
birds
no
matter
what
color
they
are
on
top
are
often
white
underneath
so
that
when
a
fish
looks
up
the
bird
looks
like
part
of
the
sky


black
birds
include
crows
ravens
and
<collocation>male blackbirds</collocation>


some
birds
that
are
dark
colors
spend
quite
a
lot
of
time
on
the
ground
hopping
around
in
the
shadows
under
bushes


among
these
birds
are
the
<collocation>male blackbird</collocation>
and
the
satin
which
is
not
black
but
very
dark
blue


crows

often
perch

winter
where
their
black

are
the

ones
females
are
dowdy
many
birds
are
not
camouflaged
but
stand
out
with
<collocation>vivid colors</collocation>


they
are
usually
male
birds
whose
females
are
dull
and
camouflaged


the
function
of
the
colors
is


first
the
colors
help
them
get
mates
and
second
the
colors
identify
them
to
other
males
of
the
same
species


many
birds
are
territorial
especially
in
the
<collocation>nesting season</collocation>


they
give
out
territory
sounds
and
are
easily
seen


this
lets
other
males
know
they
will
defend
their
territory


it
sends
out
a
look
elsewhere
signal
to
their
competitors


some
birds
are
famous
for
their
color
and
are
named
for
it
such
as
the

the
azure
kingfisher
the
<collocation>golden pheasant</collocation>
the
scarlet

the
violet

and
the

many

countless
combinations

have
such
beautiful

they
have

the

is
the
best
example
of
a
display
of

and
also

banded
flight
most
birds
can
fly


they
do
this
by
pushing
through
the
air
with
their
wings


the
<collocation>curved surfaces</collocation>
of
the
wings
cause
air
currents
wind
which
lift
the
bird


flapping
keeps
the
air
current
moving
to
create
lift
and
also
moves
the
bird
forward


some
birds
can
glide
on
air
currents
without
flapping


many
birds
use
this
method
when
they
are
about
to
land


some
birds
can
also
hover
and
remain
in
one
place


this
method
is
used
by
birds
of
prey
such
as
falcons
that
are
looking
for
something
to
eat


seagulls
are
also
good
at
hovering
particularly
if

the
most

hovering
birds
are
<collocation>tiny hummingbirds</collocation>

both

main
flight
feathers
are
long
and
wide


they
help
the
eagle
to
stay
on
rising
air
currents
without
using
much
energy
while
the
eagle
looks
at
the
ground
below
to
find
the
next
meal


when
the
eagle
sees
some
small
creature
move
it
can
close
its
wings
and
fall
from
the
sky
like
a
missile
opening
its
great
wings
again
to
slow
down
as
it
comes
to
land


the
world
largest
eagle
the
philippine
eagle
has
a
wingspan
of
about
metres
ft
wide


birds
that
live
in
grassland
areas
or
open
forests
and
feed
on
fruit
insects
and
reptiles
often
spend
a
lot
of
time
flying
short
journeys
looking
for
food
and
water


they
have
wings
that
are
shaped
in
a
similar
way
to
eagles
but
rounder
and
not
as
good
for
soaring


these
include
many
australian
birds
like
cockatoos


birds
such
as
geese
that
migrate
from
one
country
to
another
fly
very
long
distances


their
wings
are
big
and
strong
because
the
birds
are
large
and
they
stock
up
on
food
for
the
long
flight


migrating
water
birds
usually
form
family
groups
of
birds


they
fly
very
high
making
use
of
long
streams
of
air
that
blow
from
north
to
south
in
different
seasons


they
are
very
well
organised
often
flying
in
a
v
pattern


the
geese
at
the
back
do
not
have
to
flap
so
hard
they
are
pulled
on
by
the
wind
of
the
ones
at
the
front


every
so
often
they
change
the
leader
so
that
the
front
bird
who
does
most
work
and
sets
the
pace
can
have
a
rest


geese
and
swans
are
the
birds
reaching
metres
or
more
when
on
migration


geese
often
honk
loudly
while
they
are
flying


it
is
thought
that
they
do
this
to
support
the
leader
and
help
the
young
ones


birds
that
fly
very
quickly
such
as
swifts
and
swallows
have
long
narrow
pointed
wings


these
birds
need
great
speed
because
they
eat
insects
catching
most
of
them
while
they
are
flying
