velocity
is
a
measure
of
how
fast
something
has
moved
in
a
particular
direction


in
physics
velocity
means
the
time
it
took
an
object
to
move
from
one
place
to
another
displacement
and
the
direction
of
movement
this
is
known
as
a
vector
quantity


an
object
could
travel
at
metres
per
second
in
a
direction
of
south
of
east


this
is
velocity

velocity

displacement

time
plus
direction


so
for
example
something
that
moves
in
a
square
and
finishes
back
where
it
started
has
not
been
displaced


this
would
mean
that
the
object
displacement
zero
and
it
would
have
a
velocity
of
zero


it
is
different
to
the
speed
that
it
moved
around
the
square


people
often
use
velocity
and
speed
to
mean
the
same
thing
but
they
are
different

a
wiki
is
a
type
of
website
that
lets
anyone
who
can
access
the
wiki
create
and
change
its
pages


the
word
is
internet
slang


the
word
wiki
is
short
for


is
a
word
from
hawaiian
meaning
fast
or
speed


examples
of
include
and


every
wiki
can
be
changed
or
edited
by
everyone
who
has
an
account
on
the
wiki
or
by
everyone
in
the
world
if
the
wiki
allows
<collocation>anonymous access</collocation>
although
some
important
pages
can
not
be
changed
by
anyone


are
central
places
where
we
all
can
share
information
with
each
other
people
can
add
new
information
and
then
people
read
them


allow
information
from
all
around
the
world
to
be
collected


on
a
wiki
people
can
write
pages
together
to
add
to
the
information


if
one
person
writes
something
wrong
then
the
next
person
can
correct
it


the
next
person
can
also
add
something
new
to
the
page


because
of
this
the
page
gets
better
whenever
someone
changes
it


if
someone
writes
information
that
is
very
obviously
wrong
and
the
person
actually
wanted
to
it
would
be
changed
by
administrators
and
the
person
will
not
be
able
to
change
the
wiki
anymore


pages
are
watched
closely


users
can
also
discuss
things
on


discussion
can
help
people
understand
things
better
or
gives
people
a
chance
to
tell
their
views


in
the
talk
pages
are
for
that
but
in
some
the
article
and
the
discussion
are
in
the
same
page


can
be
used
for
different
things
not
all
follow
the
same
rules
for
using
them


for
example
the
purpose
of
is
to
write
articles
for
an
encyclopedia


that
is
why
in
people
do
not
want
to
hear
general
discussion
that
does
not
help
in
writing
articles


ward
started
the
first
wiki
in

liked

vandalism
a
wiki
is
freely
by
anyone


some
are
even
available
to
people
without
an
account
so
are
the
best
targets
for
vandals
to
add
bad
content
to
because
it
is
easy
for
them
to
save
the
page


there
are
many
ways
to
prevent
this


like
protecting
the
page
to
only
allow
registered
users
to
edit
or
simply
block
them
if
they
go
out
of
hand


there
is
no
way
to
stop
vandalism
totally
but
it
is
possible
to
lower
the
number
of
