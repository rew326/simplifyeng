jargon
is
a
special
way
to
use
words
that
are
shared
only
by
a
certain
group
of
people


they
do
not
mean
what
the
dictionary
says
they
mean


they
have
different
meanings
to
the
people
using
them
than
their
everyday
meaning


for
example
the
ordinary
words
boot
net
and
web
also
have
special
meanings
for
users
of

the

and
the
world
<collocation>wide web</collocation>


these
and
to
flame
to
ping
and
many
acronyms
are
part
of
net
jargon


an
acronym
means
that
only
some
of
the
letters
in
the
word
or
phrase
are
used


often
this
is
the
first
letter
of
each
word


other

found
online
are
simply
common
shorthand


see

usually
more
jargon
is
created
over

jargon
is
also
common
in
the
military


it
includes
phrases
like
snafu


jargon
can
be
used
by
a
clique
to
prevent
others
from
joining
or
understanding
but
it
also
is
often
just
used
because
it
is
shorter

the
atmosphere
near
the
surface
of
jupiter
is
made
of
about
to
hydrogen
to
helium
and
other
gases


further
into
the
planet
it
is
so
hot
and
the
pressure
so
high
that
helium
becomes
a
liquid
and
or
rains
further
down
into
the
planet


based
on
spectroscopy
jupiter
seems
to
be
made
of
similar
gases
to
saturn


it
is
not
as
similar
to
neptune
or
uranus


these
two
planets
have
much
less
hydrogen
and
helium
gas


the
very
high
temperatures
and
pressures
in
jupiter
core
mean
scientists
can
not
tell
what
materials
would
be
there


this
can
not
be
found
out
because
it
is
not
possible
to
create
the
same
amount
of
pressure
on
earth


above
the
unknown
inner
core
is
an
outer
core


the
outer
core
of
jupiter
is
thick
liquid
hydrogen


the
pressure
is
high
enough
to
make
the
hydrogen
solid
but
then
it
melts
because
of
the
heat


mass
jupiter
is
twice
as
massive
as
all
the
other
planets
in
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
put
together


it
gives
off
more
heat
than
it
gets
from
the
sun


jupiter
is
times
the
width
of
earth
and
times
as
massive


the
volume
of
jupiter
is
times
the
volume
of
earth


in
other
words
objects

it


cloud
layers
jupiter
has
many
bands
of
clouds
going
horizontally
across
its
surface


the
light
parts
are
called
zones
and
the
darker
are
called
belts


the
zones
and
belts
often
interact
with
each
other


this
causes
huge
storms


wind
speeds
of
kilometres
per
hour
are
common
on
jupiter


to
show
the
difference
the
strongest
tropical
storms
on
earth
are
about


most
of
the
clouds
on
jupiter
are
made
of
ammonia


there
may
also
be
clouds
of
water
vapor
similar
to
clouds
on
earth


spacecrafts
such
as
voyager
have
seen
lightning
on
the
surface
of
the
planet


scientists
think
it
was
water
vapor
because
lightning
needs
water
vapor


these
lightning
bolts
have
been
measured
as
up
times
as
powerful
as
those
on
earth


the
brown
and
orange
colors
are
caused
when
sunlight
passes
through
or
refracts
with
the
many
gases
in
the
atmosphere


great
red
spot
one
of
the
biggest
features
in
jupiter
atmosphere
is
the
great
red
spot


it
is
a
huge
storm
which
is
bigger
than
the
entire
earth


it
has
been
known
about
for
just
under
years
and
possibly
even
longer


storms
can
last
for
hours
or
as
long
as
hundreds
of
years
in
the
case
of
the
great
red
spot


magnetic
field
jupiter
has
a
magnetic
field
similar
to
earth
but
times
stronger


it
is
also
has
what
is
known
as
a
magnetosphere


the
strength
of
the
field
is
enough
to
be
a
serious
danger
to
any
spacecraft
traveling
past
or
to
jupiter


the
magnetic
field
is
probably
caused
by
the
large
amounts
of
liquid
metallic
hydrogen
in
the
core
of
jupiter


the
four
largest
moons
of
jupiter
orbit
or
go
around
the
planet
within
the
magnetic
field


this
protects
them
from
the
solar
wind


jupiter
magnetic
field
is
so
large
it
reaches
the
orbit
of
saturn
million

away


the

rings
of

jupiter
also
has
a
thin
planetary
ring
system


these
rings
are
very
difficult
to
see
and
so
they
were
not
discovered
until
nasa
voyager

went
to

in


there
are
four
parts
to
jupiter
rings


the
closest

called
the

the
main

the
third

fourth
rings
called
the
<collocation>gossamer rings</collocation>
are
transparent

through
and
are
made
from
microscopic
debris
and
dust


this

probably

the

one

the
average
distance
between
jupiter
and
the

is
million
kilometres


this
is
five
times
the
distance
between
earth
and
the
sun


jupiter
is
not
tilted
on
its
axis
as
much
as
the
earth
or
mars


this
causes
it
to
have
no
seasons
for
example
summer
or
winter


jupiter
rotates
or
spins
around
very
quickly


this
causes
the
planet
to
bulge
in
the

jupiter
is
the

it
completes

the

jupiter
is

night
sky
after

moon
and
venus


because
of
that
people
have
always
been
able
to
see
it
from
earth


the
first
person
known
to
really
study
the
planet
was
galileo
galilei
in


he
was
the
first
person
to
see
jupiter
moons
io
europa
ganymede
and
callisto


this
was
because
he
used
a
telescope
unlike
anyone
before
him


no
new
moons
were
discovered
for
more
than
two
<collocation>hundred years</collocation>


in
astronomer
barnard
found
a

using
his

he
called

it
was
the
last
of

to
be

either
flown

since


these
were
pioneer
pioneer

in


the
<collocation>pioneer missions</collocation>
were
the
first
spacecraft
to
take
close
up
pictures
of
jupiter
and
its

five
years
later
the
two
voyager
spacecraft
discovered
over
new
moons


they
captured
photo
evidence
of
lightning
on
the
night
side
of
jupiter


the
ulysses
probe
was
sent
to
study
the
sun


it
only
went
to
jupiter
after
it
had
finished
its
main
mission


ulysses
had
no
cameras
so
it
took
no
photographs


in
the
spacecraft
on
its
way
to
saturn
took
some
very
good
very
clear
pictures
of
the
planet


also
found
a
moon
and
took
a
picture
of
it
but
it
was
too
far
away
to
show
the
details


the
galileo
mission
in
was
the
only
spacecraft
to
go
into
orbit
around
jupiter


it
flew
around
the
planet
for
seven
years
and
studied
all
of
the
four
biggest
moons


it
launched
a
probe
into
the
planet
to
get
information
about
jupiter
atmosphere


the
probe
traveled
to
a
depth
of
about
km
before
it
was
crushed
by
the
weight
of
all
the
gas
above
it


this
is
called
pressure


the
galileo
spacecraft
was
also
crushed
in
when
nasa
steered
the
craft
into
the
planet
on
purpose


they
did
this
so
that
the
craft
could
not
crash
into
europa
a
moon
which
scientists
think
might
have
life


future
nasa
have
sent
another
spacecraft
to
jupiter
called
juno


it
was
launched
on
august


the
spacecraft
will
go
into

around
the

in
july


several

have
been
planned
to
send

to
jupiter
moons
europa

gravity
affects

greatly


the

caused
by
the

of
