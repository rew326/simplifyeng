was
told
by

parents
and
john
dudley
that
she
was
queen


she
became
sick
with
fright
and
fainted


she
did
not
want
to
take
the
crown


the
crown
is
not
my
right


it
me
not


the
lady
mary
is
the

heir
jane
said


her
parents
swore
at
her
and
john
dudley
told
her
that
she
<collocation>doth wrong</collocation>
to
herself
and
her
house


under
pressure
jane
finally
relented


lady
jane
said
she
never
forgave
herself
for
doing
this


meanwhile
news
was
spreading
the
jane
had
been
proclaimed
the
new
queen


although
the
people
liked
jane
they
loved
mary
and
elizabeth
more


they
also
did
not
like
john
dudley


in
east
mary
was
gaining
support
and
planning
to
march
into
london


dudley
tried
to
enforce
a
but
to
no
avail


on
july
mary
became
queen


jane
was
queen
for
nine
days


<collocation>imprisonment jane</collocation>
returned
all
the
<collocation>crown jewels</collocation>
and
clothes


she
was
then
brought
into
the
tower
of
london


there
she
was
kept
in
a
cell
for
the
next
few
months


however
she
was
allowed
to
walk
in
the
garden


she
wrote
many
letters
and
read
many
books
while
at
the
tower
of
london


she
wrote
a
letter
to
queen
mary
saying
that
she
never
wanted
the
crown


queen
mary
believed
jane
and
refused
to
execute
her
cousin


many
people
pressured
mary
but
she
was
stubborn


she
still
ordered
that
a
trial
be
held
for
traditional
purposes


jane
was
found
guilty
but
the
queen
pardoned
her


however
the
next
year
a
group
of
rebels
under
thomas
including
jane
father
henry
grey
led
a
rebellion
against
queen
mary
because
she
was
planning
to
marry
prince
ii
of
spain


it
was
quickly
put
down


although
jane
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
mary
did
not
want
to
kill
her
cousin
her
advisors
told
her
that
would
only
come
if
jane
was
killed


so
with
a
heavy
heart
sadly
queen
mary
signed
the
death
warrant


jane
was
going
to
be
beheaded


effects
when
jane
was
told
that
her
head
was
going
to
be
cut
off
she
was
very
scared


nonetheless
she
was
happy
that
her
sad
and
<collocation>woeful days</collocation>
of
life
were
finally
coming
to
an
end


meanwhile
mary
still
did
not
want
to
kill
her
cousin


so
she
sent
a
catholic
priest
to
try
to
convert
jane
to
catholicism


that
way
jane
would
not
be
a
threat


jane
was
a
firm
protestant
and
refused
to
become
a
catholic


jane
execution
was
postponed
from
february
to
february
to
try
and
make
her
a
catholic


the
night
before
the
execution
jane
wrote
many
letters
to
her
family
and
prepared
her
neck
for
the
block


the
next
morning
her
hair
was
tied
back
and
she
watched
go
very
unwillingly
to
the
block


then
it
was
her
turn


execution
a
bystander
helps
jane
find
her
way
to
the
block


meanwhile
the
executioner
gets
ready
to
swing
the
axe
on
jane
neck


on
february
at
the
tower
of
london
jane
was
sent
to
the
scaffold


she
calmly
climbed
the
scaffold
and
said
a
speech


she
said
the
psalm
in
the
most
devout
manner


she
then
knelt
by
the
block
and
tied
a
piece
of
cloth
around
her
eyes


when
the
executioner
told
her
to
put
her
head
on
the
block
she
reached
out
but
could
not
find
the
block
since
she
was
very
scared


she
cried
for
help
until
someone
grabbed
her
hands
and
helped
her
find
the
block


jane
then
put
her
neck
above
the
block
and
slowly
lowered
it
onto
the
block
pressed
her
neck
against
the
wood
and
fit
her
chin
in
the
hold


then
she
brought
her
arms
around
her


before
she
was
executed
she
cried
out
lord
into
thy
hands
i
commend
my
spirit


beheading
the
crowd
watched
as
the
executioner
raised
the
axe
high
in
the
air


jane
was
shivering
badly
but
her
neck
stayed
perfectly
still


then
the
executioner
quickly
swung
the
axe
down
perfectly
at
the
middle
of
jane
neck
which
was
severed
in
a
single
stroke


jane
severed
head
fell
to
the
straw
in
front
of
the
block
while
huge
amounts
of
blood
splattered
across
the
scaffold


the
executioner
then
grabbed
jane
head
by
her
red
hair
and
lifted
it
up
to
show
the
crowd


he
shouted
so
perish
all
the
queen
enemies


behold
the
head
of
a
traitor


burial
after
the
crowd
left
the
blood
was
removed
and
jane
body
was
brought
to
the
church
peter
ad


since
the
church
had
just
become
catholic
and
jane
was
a
protestant
they
had
to
get
permission
from
queen
mary
to
bury
her


it
was
four
hours
until
her
maids
were
allowed
to
prepare
her
body
for
burial


jane
body
was
buried
between

cousin

in
the

when

failed
thomas
found
a
place
for

daughter
at

court
as
to
queen
katherine


there
anne
fell
in
love
with
sir
henry
who
was
the
eldest
son
of
the
earl
of
and
they
became
secretly
engaged
to
be
married
much
to
the
displeasure
of
their
respective
families


cardinal
ordered
them
to
be
separated


anne
was
sent
home
to
castle
and
henry
was
forced
to
marry
lady
mary
talbot
the
daughter
of
edward
talbot
earl
of


anne
blamed
cardinal
for
her
lost
love
and
was
determined
to
have
her
revenge
on
him
because
he
had
called
her
a
<collocation>foolish girl</collocation>


royal
love
affair
anne
came
back
to
the
royal
court
and
soon
king
henry
fell
passionately
in
love
with
her


he
wanted
her
to
become
his
mistress
however
she
categorically
refused
which
made
henry
desire
for
her
even
greater


king
henry
marriage
to
catherine
of
had
produced
only
one
daughter
princess
mary
not
thought
suitable
to
rule
the
country
after
his
death


henry
needed
a
son
to
succeed
him
and
to
secure
the
tudor
dynasty
but
catherine
was
now
too
old
to
have
children


henry
then
came
to
see
anne
as
the
answer
to
the
problem
of
the
succession
and
decided
to
divorce
catherine
so
that
he
could
marry
anne
instead
and
have
male
heirs


he
said
that
the
marriage
was
not
valid
because
catherine
had
been
married
to
his
older
brother
arthur
prince
of
wales
before
she
had
married
henry


arthur
had
died
a
few
months
after
the
marriage
at
the
age
of
fifteen
and
a
<collocation>special dispensation</collocation>
from
the
pope
on
the
ground
the
marriage
had
never
been
consummated
was
issued
so
catherine
could
marry
henry
and
the
alliance
between
spain
and
england
would
be
kept


king
henry
now
thought
that
their
marriage
should
not
have
been
allowed
in
the
first
place
and
that
they
had
been
punished
by
not
having
any
sons


he
quoted
a
verse
from
the
bible
that
said
a
man
may
not
marry
his
brother
wife


he
said
he
was
doing
what
he
thought
was
right
even
though
he
still
loved
catherine
but
his
conscience
would
not
allow
him
to
continue
living
in
sin
with
her


the
plans
for
the
divorce
caused
a
lot
of
gossip
at
court
and
abroad
and
became
known
as
the
king
great
matter


a
special
court
was
held
with
leading
it
to
decide
if
the
divorce
should
be
allowed


an
official
from
the
pope
in
rome
was
brought
over
and
a
trial
was
held


the
official
stated
that
he
could
not
decide
what
to
do


he
wanted
the
pope
to
decide
instead


the
pope
was
fearful
to
offend
charles
v
holy
roman
emperor
nephew
of
catherine
and
what
would
happen
if
he
allowed
the
divorce


he
did
not
make
a
decision


in
the
meantime
anne
and
king
henry
were
becoming
more
and
more
impatient


marriage
after
becoming
marquess
of
pembroke
in
her
own
right
anne
felt
secure
enough
and
finally
gave
in
to
henry
in
late
and
soon
became
pregnant


in
order
to
have
a
legitimate
heir
to
the
throne
this
meant
that
anne
and
henry
needed
to
legalize
their
union
quickly
and
therefore
were
secretly
married
on
january
even
though
the
divorce
had
not
come
through


no
longer
hoping
for
the
pope
to
grant
him
a
divorce
henry
marriage
to
catherine
of
was
declared
illegal
in
the
following
may
by
the
newly
appointed
archbishop
of
canterbury
thomas
former
chaplain
of
the


catherine
was
sent
away
from
court
with
the
title
of
dowager
princess
of
wales
as
if
she
had
never
been
married
to
henry


now
recognized
as
henry
legal
wife
anne
was
formally
crowned
queen
of
england
on
june


all
that
was
needed
now
was
the
birth
of
a
son
and
her
triumph
would
be
complete


anne
gave
birth
to
a
daughter
the
future
elizabeth
i
of
england
on
september


king
henry
was
very
disappointed
after
all
his
troubles
the
problem
of
the
succession
was
still
not
resolved


however
anne
soon
became
pregnant
again
but
that
ended
in
a
miscarriage
in
the
summer
of


henry
started
to
worry
that
anne
could
not
give
him
a
healthy
male
child


feeling
the
king
displeasure
anne
became
more
and
more
insecure
and
ever
more
difficult
and
henry
began
tiring
of
her


the
situation
only
deteriorated
when
the
king
began
to
pay
special
attention
to
a
lady
of
the
court
named
jane


when
on
january
anne
gave
birth
to
a
stillborn
male
child
henry
felt
betrayed
and
completely
turned
against
her
accusing
her
of
having
bewitched
him


downfall
and
execution
henry
new
secretary
thomas
cromwell
looked
for
a
way
to
get
rid
of
anne
so
that
henry
could
marry

he
found
people
who
said
that
anne
had
been
the
lover
of
other
men
while
she
was
married
to
king
henry


she
was
put
on
trial
and
found
guilty
of
treason
adultery
and
incest

she
was
probably
innocent

of
being
her
lovers
were
sir

her
musician
mark
sir
henry

and
her

were

mona
also

or

is
a
portrait
painted
in
oil
by
leonardo
<collocation>da vinci</collocation>
during
the
renaissance
in
florence
italy


many
people
think
mona
smile
is
mysterious


it
is
so
often
studied
recognized
and
copied
that
it
is
the
most
famous
painting
in
the
world


the
louvre
says
that
about
percent
of
its
visitors
come
to
see
the
painting
of
mona


the
painting
is
owned
by
the
government
of
france
and
is
shown
at
the
du
louvre
in
paris
under
the
title
portrait
of
wife
of
del


who
was
leonardo
first
biographer
a
person
who
writes
about
the
life
of
another
person
thought
the
painting
was
of
a
person
named


speculation
over
the
painting
model
was
solved
in
by
dr
a
<collocation>manuscript expert</collocation>


notes
discovered
in
university
library
which
were
written
by
a
florentine
city
official
reinforced
earlier
identification
of
the
model


was
the
wife
of
del
a
rich
silk
merchant
who
lived
in
florence


perhaps
mona
although
the
sitter
has
traditionally
been
identified
as
del
a
lack
of
definitive
evidence
has
long
fueled
alternative
theories
including
leonardo
mother
in
a
distant
memory
as
the
painting
subject
and
the
possibility
that
leonardo
used
his
own
likeness


leonardo
began
painting
the
mona
in
or
in
florence
italy


according
to
<collocation>da vinci</collocation>
contemporary
after
he
had
lingered
over
it
four
years
left
it
unfinished


the
painting
was
brought
to
france
by
leonardo
in
and
it
was
bought
by
francis
i
of
france


the
mona
used
to
hang
in
the
chateau
and
was
then
moved
to
the
palace
of
versailles


after
the
french
revolution
napoleon
i
of
france
had
it
hanging
in
his
bedroom
in
the
palace
but
it
was
later
moved
to
the
louvre
where
it
is
still
hanging
today


stolen
on
august
the
mona
was
stolen


the
louvre
museum
thought
it
was
being
photographed
but
when
they
checked
it
was
not
there


the
louvre
closed
for
one
week
to
help
look
for
it


people
thought
a
french
poet
stole
it


he
was
put
into
jail
and
tried
to
make
people
think
his
friend
pablo
picasso
did
it
and
he
was
questioned


it
was
not
either
of
them
though


it
was
lost
for
two
years
and
everybody
thought
it
would
be
lost
forever


a
worker
at
the
louvre
named
had
actually
stolen
it


he
had
hidden
it
in
his
coat
and
walked
out
with
it
after
the
museum
had
closed
