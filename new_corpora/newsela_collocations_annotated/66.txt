society
is
the
term
to
describe
human
beings
together
collective
the
sum
of
their
social
networks
and
power
networks


it
does
not
refer
to
everything
everybody
thinks
or
does
but
only
to
those
things
that
everybody
acts
upon
or
refuses
to
do
quite
reliably


because
it
must
keep
even
the
poorest
and
weakest
members
of
a
society
willing
to
help
even
the
richest
and
strongest
a
society
is
very
concerned
with
its
citizenship
rights
ethics
and
time
limits


these
are
basic
ways
to
achieve
fairness


if
they
break
down
badly
people
will
think
the
society
is
unfair
and
start
taking
things
from
each
other
refusing
to
help
each
other
or
seeing
those
who
have
more
as
cheats


while
every
society
is
different
the
way
it
breaks
down
and
fails
is
very
often
the
same
fraud
theft
violence
war
and
sometimes
even
genocide
if
people
stop
identifying
with
the
society
and
thus
identify
with
what
they
think
of
as
a
race
of
people


a
new
society
may
be
formed
out
of
only
those
who
still
agree
or
who
just
survive
the
collapse
of
an
old
failed
one


if
the
strength
and
unity
of
any
society
members
willingness
to
help
each
other
is
to
be
measured
it
is
called
social
capital
because
it
substitutes
for
other
forms
of
capital


one
needs
less
money
with
more
solidarity
in
society
because
the
collective
substitutes
for
the
currency


however
usually
the
strength
is
not
directly
measured
but
only
assumed


people
take
risks
that
society
will
support
them
without
knowing
for
sure
that
it
will


for
instance
they
may
refuse
to
obey
the
law
and
count
on
their
fellow
society
members
to
free
them
in
a
jury
or
court
of
appeal


a
<collocation>social contract</collocation>
sets
out
rules
for
this
kind
of
cooperation


one
kind
of
<collocation>social contract</collocation>
is
a
constitution
which
allows
for
a
jury
or
court
to
decide
that
the
law
not
the
person
is
wrong
according
to
the

rules

scale
of
the
universe
mapped
to
the
branches
of
science


science
is
what
we
do
to
find
out
about
the
natural
world


it
is
the
total
of
physics
chemistry
biology
geology
and
astronomy


science
makes
use
of
mathematics
and
it
makes
observations
and
experiments


science
produces
accurate
facts
scientific
laws
and
theories


science
also
refers
to
the
large
amount
of
knowledge
that
has
been
found
using
this
process


research
uses
the
scientific
method


scientific
research
uses
hypotheses
based
on
ideas
or
earlier
knowledge


then
those
hypotheses
are
tested
by
experiments


people
who
study
and
research
science
and
try
to
find
out
everything
about
it
are
called
scientists


scientists
study
things
by
looking
at
them
very
carefully
by
measuring
them
and
by
doing
experiments
and
tests


scientists
try
to
explain
why
things
act
the
way
they
do
and
predict
what
will

scientific
method
today
science
usually
refers
to
a
way
of
pursuing
knowledge
not
just
the
knowledge
itself


it
is
mainly
about
the
phenomena
of
the
material
world


in
the
and
centuries
scientists
increasingly
sought
to
formulate
knowledge
in
terms
of
laws
of
nature
such
as
newton
laws
of
motion


and
over
the
course
of
the
century
the
word
science
became
increasingly
associated
with
the
scientific
method
itself
as
a
way
to
study
the
natural
world
including
physics
chemistry
geology
and
biology


it
is
in
the
century
also
that
the
term
scientist
was
created
by
william


he
meant
it
to
distinguish
those
who
sought
knowledge
on
nature
from
those
who
sought
other
types
of
knowledge


the
scientific
method
is
the
name
given
to
the
methods
used
by
scientists
to
find
knowledge


the
main
features
of
the
scientific
method
are
scientists
identify
a
question
or
a
problem
about
nature


some
problems
are
simple
such
as
how
many
legs
do
flies
have


and
some
are
very
deep
such
as
why
do
objects
fall
to
the
ground


next
scientists
investigate
the
problem


they
work
at
it
collecting
facts


sometimes
all
it
takes
is
to
look
carefully


some
questions
can
not
be
answered
directly


then
scientists
suggest
ideas
and
test
them
out


they
do
experiments
and
collect
data


eventually
they
figure
out
what
they
think
is
a
good
answer
to
the
problem


then
they
tell
people
about
it


later
other
scientists
may
agree
or
not
agree


they
may
suggest
another
answer


they
may
do
more
experiments


anything
in
science
might
be
revised
if
we
find
out
the
previous
solution
was
not
good
enough


other
features
of
science
not
everyone
completely
agrees
about
how
science
works


some
philosophers
and
scientists
say
that
scientific
theories
are
only
accepted
for
the
time
being


they
last
so
long
as
they
are
the
best
explanation


when
theories
no
longer
explain
the
data
they
are
discarded
and
replaced


or
sometimes
scientists
will
make
a
theory
better
rather
than
discard
it
or
that
they
will
keep
on
using
the
theory
hoping
that
it
will
be
made
better
eventually


science
is
a
way
to
get
knowledge
by
discarding
what
is
not
true


scientists
must
be
very
careful
to
make
explanations
that
fit
well
with
what
they
observe
and
measure


they
compete
to
provide
better
explanations


an
explanation
might
be
interesting
or
pleasing
but
if
it
does
not
agree
with
what
other
scientists
really
see
and
measure
they
will
try
to
find
a
better
explanation


before
a
scientific
article
is
published
other
scientists
read
the
article
and
decide
whether
the
explanations
make
sense
from
the
data


this
is
called
peer
review


after
articles
are
published
other
scientists
will
also
check
if
the
same
experiments
observations
or
tests
produce
the
same
data
again


peer
review
and
repeating
experiments
are
the
only
way
to
be
sure
the
knowledge
is
correct


science
makes
models
of
nature
models
of
our
universe
and
medicine


there
are
many
different
sciences
with
their
own
names


however
it
is
not
right
to
say
science
says
any
one
thing


science
is
a
process
not
just
the
facts
and
rules
believed
at
one
time

salami
salami
is
a
sausage
that
first
came
from
italy


the
name
comes
from
the
italian
meaning
to
make
something
salty


the
original
salami
was
made
from
a
mix
of
chopped
pork
and
salt
which
was
dried
using
air
in
a
casing


people
who
are
muslim
are
not
allowed
to
eat
this
type
of
salami
because
it
is
pork


now
there
are
many
types
of
salamis
made
in
some
countries


nearly
all
are
seasoned
with
a
combination
of
herbs
and
spices
in
addition
to
salt


salamis
are
now
sometimes
smoked
or
cooked
before
air
drying


some
kinds
are
made
of
beef
while
others
mix
beef
and
pork


most
if
not
all
italian
salamis
have
garlic
in
them
but
few
german
kinds
do
for
example


some
like
a
few
salamis
from
spain
include
paprika
or
chili


the
difference
between
some
types
is
in
how
coarse
or
fine
the
meat
is
chopped


some
light
salami
might
add
turkey
or
chicken
to
reduce
both
fat
and
calories


many
salamis
are
named
after
the
city
or
region
where
they
come
from


some
examples
are
arles

slang
are
words
that
are
informal


usually
each
generation
or
social
group
has
its
own
slang
for
example
older
people
can
have
trouble
understanding
the
slang
of
younger
people


on
the
other
hand
younger
people
often
understand
but
find
silly
or
the
slang
of
older
people


over
time
language
tends
to
get
more
complex
since
new
words
enter
much
faster
than
old
words
leave


over
time
slang
almost
always
becomes
part
of
the
language
and
approved
for
use
by
all


it
has
also
happened
that
some
words
used
in
for
<collocation>bodily functions</collocation>
became
thought
of
as
profanity
or
rude
after
they
were
replaced
by
latinate
words
like
urinate
defecate
and
copulate
which
polite
people
were
supposed
to
use
after
the
<collocation>norman conquest</collocation>
of
england
in


this
was
in
part
a
way
of
making
poor
people
who
spoke
all
appear
to
be
rude
while
more
powerful
people
who
spoke
norman
appeared
to
be
polite
one
way
that
etiquette
can
develop
and
reinforce
power
structure


this
is
only
one
example
from
history
of
how
racism
can
be
a
reason
for
defining
one
group
language
as
slang
and
another
as
correct


wanting
to
have
rules
of
grammar
that
do
not
change
and
the
same
vocabulary
used
by
everyone
for
better
communication
is
another
reason
that
is
often
given
for
defining
one
group
language
as
correct


an
idiom
can
be
slang
but
it
can
also
be
a
metaphor
that
becomes
part
of
the
culture


two
examples
of
slang
are
and


usually
means
what
is
up


as
in
how
are
you


and
usually
means
i
do
