be
the
largest
single
event
in
christian
history


after
the
attacks
on

worried

safety
the

shot
twice
in
the
abdomen
by
a
<collocation>muslim fanatic</collocation>


the
pope
was
gravely
injured


he
barely
survived
the
<collocation>assassination attempt</collocation>
and
had
to
be
treated
in
hospital
for
days


the
pope
later
visited
in
prison


he
had
forgiven
him
already


exactly
one
year
later
he
traveled
to
to
thank
mary
mother
of
god
for
saving
his
life


on
this
trip
there
was
a
second
attempt
to
his
life


a
follower
of
the
french
archbishop
marcel
tried
to
hurt
the
pope
with
a
bayonet


he
was
overpowered
by
the
bodyguards
of
the
pope


and
his
followers
were
against
the
decisions
of
the
second
vatican
council


after
this
the
pope
often
traveled
in
a
trailer
known
as
the


death
pope
john
paul
ii
funeral
john
paul
died
on
saturday
on
the
eve
of
the
divine
mercy
holiday
april


the
official
time
of
death
on
his
death
certificate
was
pm
but
a
few
sources
reported
pm


the
death
certificate
stated
that
when
the
pope
died
he
had
parkinson
disease
with
serious
breathing
difficulties


the
pope
had
tracheotomy
surgery
in
mid
february
but
it
did
not
help
and
he
lost
lots
of
weight


he
also
had
an
enlarged
prostate
urinary
infection
and
other
problems


the
cause
of
death
were
that
his
kidneys
failed
causing
blood
poisoning
and
infection
brought
by
septic
shock


john
paul
ii
spoke
his
final
words
mi
do
let
me
depart
to
the
house
of
the
father
to
his
aides
and
fell
into
a
coma
about
four
hours
later


the
pope
medical
team
used
machinery
for
more
than
minutes
so
his
real
and
true
time
of
death
was
around
pm
vatican
time


as
tradition
demands
his
name
was
called
three
times


when
there
was
no
reply
his
papal
ring
was
broken
which
meant
the
end
of
john
paul
ii
papacy
reign
as
pope


many
people
claimed
to
have
been
specially
blessed
by
the
reign
of
pope
john
paul
ii


many
people
thought
he
should
be
given
the
title
blessed


this
usually
takes
at
least
five
years
and
may
take
hundreds
of
years


on
may
pope
<collocation>benedict xvi</collocation>
cut
short
the
usual
year
wait
for
the
process
to
begin


the
only
other
time
in
recent
history
that
this
has
happened
was
for
mother
who
was
made
blessed
mother
by
john
paul
ii


it
was
announced
on
january
that
john
paul
ii
would
be
on
may
divine
mercy
sunday


according
to
the
vatican
pope
john
paul
ii
remains
which
will
not
be
exhumed
and
exposed
will
be
moved
from
the
grotto
beneath
peter
basilica
where
he
is
presently
buried
to
a
marble
stone
monument
in
<collocation>pier paolo</collocation>
chapel
of
which
is
where
blessed
pope
<collocation>innocent xi</collocation>
is
currently
buried
blessed
pope
innocent
remains
will
likely
be
moved


this
more
prominent
location
next
to
the
chapel
of
the
pieta
the
chapel
of
the
blessed
sacrament
and
statues
of
popes
<collocation>pius xi</collocation>
and
pius
will
increase
the
number
of
<collocation>pilgrims capable</collocation>
of
viewing
his
memorial


it
will
be
a
great
joy
for
us
when
he
is
officially
but
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
he
is
already
a
saint


on
september
pope
francis
said
that
john
paul
together
with
pope
john
will
be
made
saints
on
april


this
is
the
first
time
two
popes
have
been
made
saints
on
the
same
day


once
john
paul
becomes
a
saint
it
has
been
suggested
that
may
should
be
the
official
john
paul
ii
day
on
church
calendar
of
the
saints


may
is
days
after
the
death
of
the
pope


may
july
have
also
been
suggested
as
his
official
saint
day
on
the
church
calendar


may
is
already
saint
pope
john
i
day


teachings
john
paul
ii
was
generally
against
communism


he
was
also
a
critic
of
capitalism
that
was
not
controlled
and
he
did
not
want
people
basic
rights
to
be
oppressed
by
world
governments


he
officially
condemned
aspects
of
liberation
theology


he
was
against
abortion
and
contraception
in
general


as
head
of
the
largest
christian
group
john
paul
ii
taught
a
<collocation>conservative theological</collocation>
view
of
human
sexuality


on
the
subject
he
wrote
topics
called
the
theology
of
the
body


he
was
against
homosexuality
and
in
favor
of
people
starting
families
as
one
husband
and
one
wife


but
he
said
that
homosexuals
have
the
same
inherent
dignity
and
rights
as
everybody
else


on
april
john
paul
instituted
a
divine
mercy
holiday
according
to
the
teachings
of
saint
and
on
that
day
she
was
also
proclaimed
a
saint
of
the
catholic
church


the
feast
of
the
mercy
of
god
is
continuously
growing
worldwide


john
paul
is
also
remembered
for
his
devotion
to
the
consecrated
holy
communion
the
holy
body
and
blood
of
christ


child
<collocation>abuse scandals</collocation>
during
john
paul
time
as
pope
the
church
was
involved
in
a
large
number
of
claims
about
child
<collocation>sexual abuse</collocation>
by
priests


there
are
many
people
who
believe
that
the
church
and
therefore
the
pope
knew
about
these
claims
and
tried
to
cover
them
up


for
example
in
the
irish
bishops
decided
that
priests
suspected
of
child
abuse
must
be
reported
to
the
police


the
vatican
sent
a
letter
to
the
bishops
that
they
were
not
to
report
such
cases


the
letter
was
from
future
pope
<collocation>benedict xvi</collocation>
who
john
paul
ii
had
asked
to
handle
