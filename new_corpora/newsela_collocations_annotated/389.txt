free
will
is
a
concept
of
philosophy
which
states
that
when
people
make
decisions
they
do
not
need
to
consider
certain
things


this
means
that
they
decide
freely


free
will
can
be
thought
of
as
a
philosophical
idea
whether
we
decide
what
we
do
or
if
nature
destiny
or
supernatural
forces
control
us


it
can
also
be
thought
of
in
a
legal
way
whether
or
not
you
can
legally
do
whatever
you
want


sometimes
people
do
not
have
the
legal
right
to
do
what
they
want

free
will
presents
a
problem
when
you
think
about
it


one
way
to
see
the
world
is
that
physics
tells
us
what
will
happen
if
we
do
something


if
we
throw
a
ball
up
into
the
air
the
ball
will
fall
back
down


if
the
world
was
only
physics
then
all
of
our
choices
are
controlled
by
past
events


this
means
that
our
choice
to
throw
the
ball
or
not
is
determined
by
some
past
event


see
determinism
the
other
way
to
see
the
world
is
that
we
actually
decide
what
we
do


the
past
does
not
make
us
choose
something


determinism
is
the
concept
that
events
in
the
past
fully
determine
events
in
the
future


to
illustrate
this
proposed
a
thought
experiment
in
which
he
called
demon


if
determinism
is
the
case
then
there
can
be
no
free
will


soft
determinism
or
tries
to
adhere
to
determinism
but
still
claims
that
free
will
is
possible


david
had
this
position


according
to
free
will
is
not
the
ability
to
make
a
different
decision
under
the
same
circumstances


because
there
may
be
<collocation>slight differences</collocation>
in
the
circumstances
a
different
decision
was
reached


a
stoic
philosopher
gives
the
example
of
a
dog
which
is
tied
to
a
cart


this
dog
can
the
freely
decide
to
follow
the
cart


william
james
coined
the
term
soft
determinism
in
an
address
titled
the
dilemma
of
determinism
in


there
james
writes
a
common
opinion
prevails
that
the
juice
has
ages
ago
been
pressed
out
of
the
controversy


james
went
on
to
argue
just
as
did
plutarch
that
events
fall
into
two
groups
the
determined
and
the
rest


quote
i
myself
believe
that
all
the
magnificent
achievements
of
mathematical
and
physical
science
our
doctrines
of
evolution
of
uniformity
of
law
and
the
rest
proceed
from
our
indomitable
desire
to
cast
the
world
into
a
more
rational
shape
in
our
minds
than
the
shape
into
which
it
is
thrown
there
by
the
crude
order
of
our
experience


the
world
has
shown
itself
to
a
great
extent
plastic
to
this
demand
of
ours
for
rationality


how
much
further
it
will
show
itself
plastic
no
one
can
say
if
a
certain
formula
for
expressing
the
nature
of
the
world
violates
my
moral
demand
i
shall
feel
as
free
to
to
throw
it
overboard
or
at
least
to
doubt
it
as
if
it
disappointed
my
demand
of
uniformity
of
sequence
the
principle
of
causality
for
example
what
is
it
but
a
postulate
an
empty
name
covering
a
demand
that
the
sequence
of
events
manifest
a
deeper
kind
of
belonging
of
one
thing
with
another
than
the
mere
arbitrary
juxtaposition
which
now
phenomenally
appears


william
james
the
will
to
believe
in
law
the
law
assumes
we
have
free
will


the
job
of
courts
is
to
find
out
when
people
do
things
and
what
they
were
thinking
when
they
decided
to
do
it


for
example
think
of
someone
who
kills
someone
else


a
court
tries
to
figure
out
if
he
or
she
actually
killed
the
other
person
and
if
he
or
she
decided
to
do
it


the
courts
do
not
ask
the
philosophical
question
above


in
science
physics
main
quantum
mind
body
problem
in
the
past
people
such
as
or
the
saw
the
universe
as
deterministic


some
people
thought
that
getting
enough
information
would
allow
them
to
predict
perfectly
what
will
happen
in
the
future


modern
science
however
is
a
mixture
of
deterministic
and
theories

fields
irrigated
by
<collocation>center pivot</collocation>
method
irrigation
is
when
people
add
water
to
plants
to
help
them
grow
when
there
is
not
enough
rain


irrigation
water
can
be
pumped
from
rivers
natural
lakes
or
lakes
created
by
dams
from
wells
or
allowed
to
flow
to
the
fields
by
the
force
of
gravity
along
pipes
or
open
canals


types
of
irrigation
irrigation
water
can
be
applied
to
the
plants
from
above
by
sprinklers
that
throw
water
out
under
pressure
or
from
watering
cans


in
sprinkler
irrigation
water
is
moved
through
pipes
to
sprinklers
scattered
around
and
within
the
field


<collocation>center pivot</collocation>
irrigation
is
a
type
of
sprinkler
irrigation


in
drip
irrigation
water
is
brought
to
the
plants
via
pipes
having
small
holes
or
special
emitters
spaced
along
the
pipe


surface
methods
allow
water
to
flow
onto
the
soil
surface
from
canals
or
pipes


traditional
methods
allow
water
to
flow
over
the
entire
surface
of
the
field
but
drip
irrigation
allows
water
to
be
directed
to
the
roots
of
each
plant
and
much
less
water
is
lost
by
soaking
into
the
ground


irrigation
raises
the
water
table
so
that
it
can
be
accessed
by
the
roots
of
the
crop
and
less
water
is
dried
up
by
the
air


impacts
irrigation
can
let
more
crops
be
grown
on
the
same
land
or
allow
a
crop
to
grow
in
a
dry
period


it
is
expensive
and
care
should
be
taken
to
ensure
that
the
benefits
from
increased
<collocation>crop yields</collocation>
are
not
exceeded
by
the
installation
and
operating
costs
of
the
<collocation>irrigation scheme</collocation>


irrigation
causes
a
subsequent
rise
in


if
saline
water
is
below
it
may
rise
to
the
surface


sometimes
salinity
becomes
high
enough
to
kill
the
plants


irrigation
water
itself
can
carry
salt
and
sometimes
other
toxic
materials
that
hurt
the
plants


to
prevent
this
<collocation>irrigation projects</collocation>
must
also
assure
good
drainage
