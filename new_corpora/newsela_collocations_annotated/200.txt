the
works
that
have
survived
are
in
fairly
rough
form


they
are
generally
thought
to
be
<collocation>lecture notes</collocation>
for
his
students


aristotle
combined
works
constitute
a
virtual
encyclopedia
of
greek
knowledge


it
has
been
suggested
that
aristotle
was
probably
the
last
person
to
know
everything
there
was
to
be
known
in
his
own
time


near
the
end
of
alexander
life
he
began
to
suspect
plots
and
threatened
aristotle
in
letters


aristotle
made
no
secret
of
his
contempt
for
alexander
pretense
of
divinity
and
the
king
executed
aristotle
grandnephew
as
a
traitor


alexander
died
in
babylon
in
without
ever
having
returned
to
his
native
land


upon
alexander
death
sentiment
in
athens
once
again
flared
up
and
aristotle
fled
the
city


however
he
died
in
of
natural
causes
within
the
year


philosophy
the
three
greatest
ancient
greek
philosophers
were
aristotle
plato
and
socrates


socrates
taught
plato
then
plato
taught
aristotle


these
three
thinkers
turned
early
greek
philosophy
into
the
beginnings
of
western
philosophy
as
it
is
today


aristotle
taught
alexander
the
great
who
later
conquered
the
entire
middle
east


plato
main
ideas
were
that
knowledge
from
the
senses
was
always
confused
and
not
pure


true
knowledge
can
be
gotten
from
the
thinking
soul
that
turns
away
from
the
world


only
the
soul
can
have
knowledge
of
forms
the
real
way
things
are


the
world
is
only
a
copy
of
these
forms
and
is
not
perfect


aristotle
thought
differently


he
thought
that
knowledge
from
the
senses
was
more
important


these
thoughts
became
some
of
the
roots
of
the
scientific
method
after
hundreds
of
years


most
of
the
things
aristotle
wrote
that
we
still
have
today
are
notes
from
his
speaking
and
teaching


some
of
his
important
writings
are
physics
metaphysics
ethics
politics
de
anima
on
the
soul
and


he
also
had
problems
with
the
atomic
theory


he
did
not
believe
in
theories
about
the
atomic
theory


he
believed
that
all
matter
was
continuous
whereas
stated
the
all
matter
was
made
up
of
<collocation>tiny indivisible</collocation>
things
called
atoms


was
proved
right
by
physicist
john
dalton
in


logic
aristotle
created
a
form
of
logic


his
logic
is
called
logic
because
it
uses
sentences
for
the
syllogism


aristotle
logic
influenced
the
history
of
western
thought


it
was
aristotle
logic
which
was
copied
and
used
in
the
arabic
and
latin
<collocation>mediaeval traditions</collocation>


it
was
dominant
for
two
and
a
half
thousand
years
until
the
late
century


then
modern
logic
was
started
by
charles
sanders
and
others


biology
octopus
swimming
torpedo
leopard
shark
aristotle
is
the
earliest
natural
historian
whose
work
has
survived
in
some
detail


he
certainly
did
research
on
the
natural
history
of
and
the
surrounding
seas
and
neighbouring
areas


the
works
history
of
animals
generation
of
animals
and
parts
of
animals
have
observations
and
interpretations
along
with
some
myths
and
mistakes


the
most
striking
passages
are
about
the
round


as
well
as
live
observation
he
got
specimens
from
the
catches
of
fishermen


his
observations
on
catfish
electric
fish
torpedo
and
are
detailed


his
writing
on
such
as
octopus
sepia
cuttlefish
and
the
<collocation>paper nautilus</collocation>
argo
are
accurate


his
description
of
the
arm
used
in
<collocation>sexual reproduction</collocation>
was
widely
until
its
rediscovery
in
the
century


he
separated
the
aquatic
mammals
from
fish
and
knew
that
sharks
and
rays
were
part
of
the
group
he
called


another
good
example
of
his
methods
comes
from
the
generation
of
animals
in
which
aristotle
describes
breaking
open
fertilized
chicken
eggs
at
intervals
to
observe
when
visible
organs
were
generated


he
gave
<collocation>accurate descriptions</collocation>
of
and
of
the
development
of
the
hound
shark

influence
of
aristotle
work
aristotle
is
still
one
of
the
most
influential
people
who
ever
lived


he
contributed
to
almost
every
kind
of
knowledge
in
his
day
and
he
started
many
new
fields


it
is
doubtful
whether
any
human
being
has
ever
known
as
much
as
he
did


aristotle
was
the
founder
of
formal
logic
pioneered
the
study
of
zoology
and
helped
to
develop
scientific
method


despite
these
achievements
aristotle
errors
are
thought
by
some
such
as
peter
to
have
held
back
science
considerably


russell
notes
that
almost
every
serious
intellectual
advance
has
had
to
begin
with
an
attack
on
some
aristotelian
doctrine


russell
also
refers
to
aristotle
ethics
as
repulsive
and
calls
his
logic
as
definitely
antiquated
as
<collocation>ptolemaic astronomy</collocation>


russell
says
these
errors
make
it
difficult
to
do
historical
justice
to
aristotle
until
one
remembers
what
an
advance
he
made
on
his
predecessors


the
immediate
influence
of
aristotle
work
was
felt
as
the
lyceum
grew
into
the
<collocation>peripatetic school</collocation>
of
philosophers


aristotle
influence
over
alexander
the
great
is
seen
in
the
latter
bringing
with
him
on
his
expedition
biologists
and
researchers

carl
edward
sagan
november
december
was
an
american
astronomer


he
tried
to
make
science
popular


he
thought
about
what
life
from
other
planets
would
be
like


he
said
that
people
should
look
for
life
on
other
planets


he
is
world
famous
for
his
popular
science
books
and
the
television

education
and
work
carl
sagan
was
born
in
brooklyn
<collocation>new york</collocation>
city
where
his
father
sam
sagan
was
a
jewish
clothes
maker
and
his
mother
molly
was
a
housewife


sagan
attended
the
university
of
chicago
earning
two
degrees
in
physics


he
followed
with
a
doctorate
in
astronomy
in
and
taught
at
harvard
university
until
when
he
moved
to
cornell
university


sagan
became
a
teacher
and
director
at
cornell
in


he
helped
many
<collocation>unmanned spacecraft</collocation>
to
explore
outer
space


he
thought
of
the
idea
of
putting
a
message
on
spacecraft
which
could
be
understood
by
any
life
from
another
planet
that
might
find
it


the
first
message
sent
into
space
was
a
large
label
on
the
space
probe
pioneer


he
continued
to
make
the
messages
better


the
last
message
he
helped
with
was
the
voyager
golden
record
that
was
sent
out
with
the
voyager
space
probes


<collocation>scientific achievements</collocation>
he
was
well
known
as
a
writer
who
warned
of
the
dangers
of
nuclear
winter


he
helped
people
learn
about
the
atmosphere
of
venus
seasonal
changes
on
mars
and
saturn
moon
titan


he
showed
that
the
atmosphere
of
venus
is
very
hot
and
dense


he
also
said
that
global
warming
was
a
growing
danger
like
the
natural
development
of
venus
into
a
hot
and
dangerous
planet
with
<collocation>greenhouse gases</collocation>


he
suggested
that
the
seasonal
changes
on
mars
were
due
to
dust
storms


sagan
was
among
the
first
to
guess
that
titan
and
jupiter
moon
europa
might
have
oceans
or
lakes
which
means
that
life
could
be
there


europa
underground
ocean
was
later
confirmed
by
the
spacecraft
galileo


sagan
thought
the
search
for
life
on
other
planets
was
a
<collocation>good idea</collocation>


he
said
scientists
should
listen
with
large
radio
telescopes
for
signals
from
other
planets


he
thought
sending
probes
to
other
planets
was
a
<collocation>good idea</collocation>


sagan
was
<collocation>editor icarus</collocation>
a
magazine
about
space
exploration
for
years


he
helped
start
the
planetary
society
and
was
a
member
of
the
institute
board
of
trustees


social
concerns
sagan
also
believed
that
the
drake
equation
suggested
that
many
kinds
of
<collocation>intelligent life</collocation>
could
form
but
that
the
lack
of
evidence
the
<collocation>fermi paradox</collocation>
suggests
that
<collocation>intelligent beings</collocation>
destroy
themselves
rather
quickly


this
made
him
keen
to
talk
about
ways
that
humanity
could
destroy
itself
in
the
hope
of
avoiding
such
destruction


under
the
name
x
sagan
wrote
about
pot
smoking
in
the
book
reconsidering
marijuana


lester
the
book
editor
told
this
to
sagan
biographer


sagan
said
that
marijuana
helped
him
write
some
of
his
books


making
science
popular
sagan
was
very
good
at
helping
people
to
understand
the
cosmos


he
gave
the
christmas
lectures
for
young
people
at
the
royal
institution


he
wrote
with
ann
who
became
his
third
wife
and
made
the
very
popular
television
series
cosmos
he
also
wrote
books
to
help
science
become
more
popular
the
dragons
of
eden
which
won
a
pulitzer
prize
brain
and
a
novel
contact
that
was
a
and
was
made
into
a
film
starring
foster
in


the
film
won
the
hugo
award


after
cosmos
sagan
was
linked
with
the
catchphrase
billions
and
billions
which
he
never
used
in
the
television
series
but
he
often
used
the
word
billions


he
wrote
<collocation>pale blue</collocation>
dot
a
vision
of
the
human
future
in
space
which
was
chosen
as
a
notable
book
of
by
the
<collocation>new york</collocation>
times


not
all
scientists
agreed
with
him


although
they
all
liked
the
way
he
made
science
popular
some
were
afraid
that
people
would
think
that
his
personal
opinions
might
be
confused
with
real
science


what
he
said
about
the
kuwait
oil
well
fires
during
the
first
gulf
war
were
shown
later
to
be
wrong


later
in
his
life
sagan
books
showed
his
skeptical
<collocation>naturalistic view</collocation>
of
the
world


in
his
book
the
world
sagan
gave
a
list
of
mistakes
he
had
made
as
an
example
of
how
science
is


the
compilation
billions
and
billions
thoughts
on
life
and
death
at
the
end
of
the
millennium
published
after
sagan
death
contains
essays
written
by
sagan
such
as
his
views
on
abortion
and
ann
account
of
his
death
as
a


personality
some
people
thought
sagan
had
a
big
ego


in
apple


chose
a
code
name
sagan
when
they
developed
the
power
macintosh


when
sagan
heard
this
he
tried
to
make
apple
computer
use
another
name


sagan
lost
the
fight
in
court
but
apple
engineers
did
what
he
asked
anyway
and
named
the
project
astronomer


sagan
tried
to
sue
apple
again
saying
they
made
him
look
stupid


sagan
lost
in
court
again
but
the
name
of
the
project
was
changed
to
law
lawyers
are
wimps


sagan
is
said
to
have
been
an
atheist
or
agnostic
but
some
people
have
said
he
was
a
because
he
said
things
like
the
idea
that
god
is
an
<collocation>oversized white</collocation>
male
with
a
flowing
beard
who
sits
in
the
sky
and
tallies
the
fall
of
every
sparrow
is
ludicrous


but
if
by
god
one
means
the
set
of
physical
laws
that
govern
the
universe
then
clearly
there
is
such
a
god


this
god
is
emotionally
unsatisfying
it
does
not
make
much
sense
to
pray
to
the
law
of
gravity


sagan
married
three
times
the
biologist
lynn
mother
of
sagan
in
artist
linda
in
and
author
ann
in
to
whom
he
was
married
until
his
death


sagan
purchased
a
house
on
the
edge
of
falls
which
looked
like
an
<collocation>egyptian crypt</collocation>


before
it
was
converted
into
a
house
the
building
served
as
the
lodge
for
a
secret
society
sphinx

legacy

a
long
and
difficult
fight
with
sagan
died
of
pneumonia
at
the
age
of
on
december
at
the
fred
cancer
research
center
in
seattle
washington


sagan
was
very
important
because
he
made
science
popular
and
changed
the
way
science
was
organized
and
because
he
defended
humanism
and
argued
against
seeing
things
from
only
one
point
of
view
