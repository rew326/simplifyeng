the
need
for
birth
control
birth
control
lets
a
man
and
woman
have
<collocation>sexual intercourse</collocation>
but
makes
pregnancy
less
likely


during
intercourse
a
man
places
his
penis
within
a
woman
vagina
and
moves
it
in
and
out


the
vagina
is
warm
and
soft
and
it
places
pressure
on
the
man
penis


these
sensations
combined
with
the
movements
stimulates
the
penis
which
causes
the
man
to
have
an
orgasm
and
to
ejaculate
to
release
semen
from
his
penis
into
the
vagina


the
semen
can
make
the
woman
pregnant


because
intercourse
is
usually
very
enjoyable
men
and
women
often
want
to
have
intercourse
a
lot
more
often
than
they
want
to
have
a
baby


birth
control
allows
them
to
have
intercourse
while
greatly
reducing
the
chances
of
the
woman
getting
pregnant


people
may
use
birth
control
for
several
reasons


perhaps
a
man
and
woman
wish
to
have
only
a
few
children
so
they
will
have
enough
money
to
give
those
children
good
food
clothes
and
education


more
children
might
mean
less
for
each
child
so
the
parents
use
birth
control
to
limit
the
number
of
children
they
have


or
maybe
a
man
and
woman
do
not
want
any
children
at
all
in
order
to
focus
on
their
own
lives
jobs
or
each
other


other
couples
may
use
birth
control
to
make
sure
that
they
do
not
have
too
many
children
in
too
short
a
time
an
idea
that
is
called
spacing
their
children


this
may
help
them
take
better
care
of
their
children


still
another
reason
is
that
a
young
couple
may
not
be
able
to
afford
having
a
baby
until
they
are
older
and
have
more
money
or
better
jobs


this
may
be
especially
true
of
younger
people
who
are
still
in
school
and
probably
not
married


by
using
birth
control
the
couple
can
grow
closer
and
strengthen
their
relationship
by
having
<collocation>sexual intercourse</collocation>
frequently
so
that
when
they
are
ready
to
have
a
baby
their
relationship
is
strong
and
stable


but
in
all
of
these
cases
the
man
and
woman
want
to
have
sex
to
be
close
to
feel
good
with
each
other
and
to
make
their
relationship
stronger


contraception
lets
them
have
intercourse
while
greatly
reducing
the
chances
of
a
pregnancy


birth
control
may
be
used
by
married
couples
or
by
couples
who
live
together
but
are
not
married
or
by
a
man
and
woman
who
are
engaged
or
by
a
couple
who
are
merely
boyfriend
and
girlfriend
or
even
by
single
people
who
are
not
in
a
relationship
at
all
but
who
may
have
casual
sex
with
others


types
of
birth
control
there
are
many
types
of
birth
control


some
of
these
have
been
done
for
a
long
time
but
many
of
them
were
only
discovered
in
the
last
eighty
years


each
type
of
birth
control
has
advantages
and
disadvantages


another
word
for
a
type
of
contraception
is
a
method


<collocation>barrier methods</collocation>
a
barrier
is
something
that
stands
between
two
things


so
<collocation>barrier methods</collocation>
stand
between
the
sperm
and
the
ovum
egg


some
<collocation>barrier methods</collocation>
help
prevent
many
sexually
transmitted
diseases
condoms
condom
this
is
the
oldest
barrier
method


a
condom
is
a
thin
tube
often
made
of
latex
that
the
man
puts
over
his
penis


this
keeps
the
sperm
from
getting
to
the
egg


condoms
are
also
called
rubbers


female
condom
this
is
like
a
condom
but
it
goes
in
the
woman
vagina


some
<collocation>barrier methods</collocation>
only
protect
a
small
amount
against
diaphragm
and
cervical
cap
these
are
objects
that
a
woman
puts
in
her
vagina
to
cover
the
cervix
the
opening
at
the
bottom
of
the
uterus
where
sperm
get
in


contraceptive
sponge
this
is
a
sponge
that
is
filled
with
spermicide
a
substance
that
kills
sperm
and
is
put
in
the
woman
vagina
over
the
cervix


<collocation>barrier methods</collocation>
can
be
easy
to
use
and
have
few
side
effects
bad
things
that
happen
if
you
take
a
medicine


some
of
them
can
be
bought
without
a
doctor
prescription


but
sometimes
they
can
be
messy
or
interfere
with
the
pleasure
and
sensation
of
sex


<collocation>hormonal methods</collocation>
these
can
only
be
used
by
women


doctors
are
trying
to
find
a
way
to
use
<collocation>hormonal methods</collocation>
for
men


<collocation>hormonal methods</collocation>
change
the
woman
<collocation>reproductive cycle</collocation>
in
different
ways
so
that
it
is
safe
for
her
man
to
ejaculate
inside
her


birth
control
<collocation>pills birth</collocation>
control
pills
these
are
pills
that
a
woman
takes
every
day
that
make
her
stop
ovulating
making
eggs


they
usually
have
both
female
hormones
estrogen
and
progesterone
in
them


some
have
only
progesterone


birth
<collocation>control patch</collocation>
this
is
a
small
and
thin
object
that
is
put
on
the
woman
skin
and
stays
there


hormones
in
the
patch
go
into
the
skin
and
into
the
woman
body


this
makes
her
not
ovulate


<collocation>emergency contraception</collocation>
pill
also
called
the
pill


this
is
a
medicine
that
is
taken
after
sex
that
makes
the
woman
less
likely
to
get
pregnant


it
is
best
if
used
very
soon
after
sex


the
longer
after
sex
it
is
taken
the
less
effective
it
is


it
is
recommended
to
be
taken
no
more
than
hours
after
the
event


after
this
time
the
pill
no
longer
works
well


implants
these
are
objects
that
are
put
under
the
woman
skin
and
stay
there
for
years


they
slowly
put
hormones
into
her
body
and
make
her
not
ovulate


these
only
have
progesterone
in
them
not
estrogen


injections
shots
this
is
where
a
doctor
or
nurse
gives
the
woman
a
shot
with
a
needle
every
three
to
six
months
depending
on
the
type
of
injection


they
inject
a
progesterone
hormone
that
makes
the
woman
not
ovulate


rings
a
soft
plastic
ring
that
is
placed
inside
the
vagina


the
hormones
in
the
ring
go
into
the
woman
vagina
and
into
her
body
to
prevent
her
from
ovulating


the
ring
can
not
be
felt
during
sex
and
one
ring
lasts
for
up
to
three
months


implants
and
injections
are
very
good
for
younger
women
or
women
who
can
not
take
a
pill
every
day


hormonal
birth
control
tends
to
be
extremely
effective
if
it
is
used
in
the
right
way


many
hormonal
birth
control
methods
also
make
women
<collocation>menses shorter</collocation>
and
with
less
bleeding
which
most
women
like


and
unlike
<collocation>barrier methods</collocation>
<collocation>hormonal methods</collocation>
do
not
interfere
with
sex


when
a
woman
is
using
hormonal
birth
control
she
and
her
man
are
usually
not
even
aware
of
it
during
intercourse
which
seems
and
feels
very
natural


for
all
of
these
reasons
<collocation>hormonal methods</collocation>
are
very
popular


but
all
hormonal
birth
control
methods
have
some
risks
for
side
effects


they
can
make
a
very
small
increase
in
the
risk
of
blood
clots
in
the
lungs
strokes
heart
attacks
and
<collocation>breast cancer</collocation>


most
of
these
risk
are
small


also
<collocation>hormonal methods</collocation>
do
not
prevent


intrauterine
methods
this
is
where
an
object
is
put
in
the
woman
uterus
womb
where
the
fetus
grows
when
she
is
pregnant


this
object
is
called
an
intrauterine
device
or
iud
acronym


there
are
two
types
of
iud
the
copper
iud
or
an
iud
with
hormones
implanted
on
it


the
hormonal
iud
has
better
protection
against
pregnancy
but
costs
more


there
are
many
good
things
about
them
do
not
need
the
woman
to
do
anything
after
they
are
put
in
last
a
long
time
up
to
years
work
very
well
at
stopping
pregnancy
of
pregnancies
are
stopped
the
worst
part
about
is
that
they
have
to
be
put
in
by
a
doctor


there
is
some
risk
of
infection
of
the
uterus
after
the
iud
is
put
in
but
this
is
only
for
months
after


copper
can
also
be
used
as
a
method
to
prevent
pregnancy
after
the
woman
and
man
already
had
sex


do
not
prevent


sterilization
this
is
when
a
man
or
woman
has
surgery
to
make
them
not
able
to
make
babies


men
can
get
a
vasectomy


this
is
a
small
surgery
where
the
tube
that
carries
sperm
from
the
testicles
is
cut


women
can
get
tubal
surgeries


these
are
ways
that
the
fallopian
tubes
are
cut
or
clipped
so
that
eggs
can
not
go
down
them
to
the
uterus


the
fallopian
tube
is
the
tube
that
carries
the
egg
from
the
woman
ovary


sterilization
is
extremely
effective
and
they
allow
a
man
and
woman
to
have
intercourse
that
seems
and
feels
very
natural


but
sterilization
does
involve
surgery
which
can
cost
more
than
other
types
of
contraception
and
can
be
unpleasant
and
unlike
other
methods
it
is
very
hard
to
reverse
if
a
couple
changes
their
minds
and
want
to
have
children
later


other
surgeries
will
make
a
woman
sterile
not
able
to
get
pregnant


these
are
not
done
only
for
contraception
but
they
are
done
for
other
reasons


hysterectomy
surgery
to
remove
the
uterus
oophorectomy
surgery
to
remove
the
ovaries
both
must
be
removed
to
make
a
woman
sterile


<collocation>traditional contraception</collocation>
main
sex
these
have
been
used
for
a
very
long
time


they
were
used
before
modern
medicine


some
of
them
were
used
before
scientists
even
discovered
how
reproduction
making
babies
happens


coitus
sometimes
called
withdrawal
or
pulling
out
when
the
man
takes
his
penis
out
of
the
woman
vagina
before
semen
liquid
that
has
sperm
in
it
comes
out


this
is
not
a
good
method
of
birth
control
because
the
fluid
that
comes
out
before
semen
comes
out
also
has
sperm
in
it
and
because
if
the
man
semen
is
close
to
the
woman
vagina
she
can
still
get
pregnant


also
because
the
man
instinct
is
to
stay
inside
the
woman
vagina
when
he
ejaculates
there
is
always
a
danger
that
he
may
not
withdraw
his
penis
in
time


even
when
it
works
this
can
be
a
very
frustrating
method
for
both
the
man
and
woman
because
it
interrupts
their
closeness
and
good
feelings
at
the
climax
of
intercourse


sex
sex
sex
without
putting
the
man
penis
in
the
woman
vagina


this
is
more
effective
than
coitus
but
it
can
still
be
risky
if
the
man
ejaculates
on
or
near
the
woman
and
it
can
also
be
frustrating
for
the
couple
not
to
be
able
to
have
intercourse


abstinence
not
having
sex


if
a
couple
can
practice
this
correctly
it
is
completely
effective
at
preventing
pregnancy


it
is
free
and
does
not
require
the
help
of
a
doctor


but
it
can
be
very
frustrating
for
a
man
and
woman
to
not
be
able
to
have
intercourse


many
methods
can
reduce
the
risk
of
but
only
abstinence
is
effective


periodic
abstinence
this
means
a
man
and
a
woman
<collocation>practice abstinence</collocation>
not
having
sex
when
the
woman
is
fertile


when
the
woman
is
not
fertile
she
will
not
get
pregnant
when
she
has
sex


natural
<collocation>family planning</collocation>
this
is
also
called
fertility
awareness


for
this
method
a
woman
reads
her
temperature
how
warm
her
body
is
in
the
morning
or
she
reads
her
cervical
mucus
liquid
that
comes
out
of
her
vagina


using
the
temperature
or
the
cervical
mucus
there
are
rules
that
say
when
the
woman
is
fertile
and
not
fertile


billings

rhythm
method
this
is
where
a
woman
records
the
number
of
days
between
her
menses
the
time
when
she
bleeds


the
woman
is
most
likely
to
be
fertile
in
the
days
right
between
her
menses


for
some
women
the
math
does
not
work


they
get
pregnant
when
the
math
says
they
are
less
fertile


method
this
is
when
a
woman
is
breastfeeding
using
her
breasts
to
make
milk
for
her
baby


there
are
certain
rules
the
woman
can
use
to
know
if
she
is
not
fertile


chances
that
this
method
will
fail
are
about
which
means
chance
she
can
get
pregnant
induced
abortion
induced
abortion
sometimes
called
just
abortion
is
when
a
doctor
gives
a
pregnant
woman
a
medicine
or
does
a
surgery
to
stop
the
pregnancy


some
people
do
not
call
abortion
a
kind
of
contraception


this
is
because
contraception
means
preventing
pregnancy
but
abortion
is
stopping
a
pregnancy
that
has
already
started


abortion
is
not
a
good
birth
control
method


if
a
woman
does
not
want
to
get
pregnant
other
methods
are
more
safe
and
inexpensive
cost
less
money


so
many
doctors
who
do
abortions
for
women
help
women
find
a
better
way
to
not
get
pregnant
the
next
time


religion
and
contraception
some
religions
do
not
like
contraception


some
of
them
teach
that
contraception
is
a
sin


religions
ideas
about
contraception
catholicism
almost
all
types
of
birth
control
are
a
sin
except
natural
<collocation>family planning</collocation>
or
abstinence


protestantism
most
protestant
churches
believe
birth
control
is
not
a
sin


islam
most
schools
of
thought
believe
that
some
methods
of
birth
control
are
not
a
sin


this
is
not
applicable
to
sterilization
birth
control
due
to
<collocation>financial hardship</collocation>
or
methods
that
deprive
a
woman
of
her
right
to
<collocation>sexual satisfaction</collocation>


judaism
there
are
many
different
beliefs
in
judaism
about
birth
control
but
even
the
most
conservative
types
of
judaism
allow
it
if
the
woman
will
get
sick
if
she
gets
pregnant


<collocation>religious beliefs</collocation>
that
contraception
is
a
sin
also
keep
people
from
doing
<collocation>safe sex</collocation>


some
groups
who
are
opposed
to
this
belief
say
it
is
dangerous
in
places
where
there
is
a
lot
of
and
aids
because
condoms
make
people
much
less
likely
to
get
but
at
the
same
times
many
feel
that
they
can
practice
extra
<collocation>marital sex</collocation>
since
they
are
