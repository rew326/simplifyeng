granites

surfaces
the
different

are
caused
by

proportions
of
the
minerals
granite
is
a
kind
of
igneous
rock
found
on
earth
but
nowhere
else
in
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>


it
is
formed
from
hot
<collocation>molten magma</collocation>


its
color
ranges
from
pink
to
gray
according
to
the
proportions
of
its
minerals


the
magma
is
forced
between
other
layers
of
rock
by
the
pressure
under
the
earth
surface


the
magma
cools
and
turns
slowly
into
solid
stone


granite
has
many
different
types
of
minerals
in
it


these
include
quartz
feldspar
and
sometimes
mica


as
the
magma
cools
these
minerals
form
crystals


the
crystals
can
be
seen
easily
if
the
granite
is
cut
and
polished


granite
is
a
common
stone
on
earth
and
makes
up
a
big
part
of
the
crust
the
earth
outer
layer


it
is
usually
found
in
the
<collocation>continental plates</collocation>
of
the
earth
crust


although
it
forms
under
the
surface
of
the
earth
there
are
many
places
where
it
has
been
forced
upwards
by
tectonic
movement


when
plates
in
the
earth
crust
move
together
they
get
bent
and
pushed
upwards


when
this
happens
granite
mountains
can
be
formed

more
interested
in
metaphysics


he
was
eager
to
learn
the
nature
of
human
experience
how
humans
could
know
something
and
what
their
knowledge
was
based
on


first
doubts
under
the
strong
influence
of
the
philosophical
system
of
and
kant
began
to
doubt
the
basic
answers
of
past
philosophers


then
kant
read
a
scottish
philosopher
david


had
tried
to
make
clear
what
our
experience
had
been
and
had
reached
a
very
strong
opinion
called
skepticism
that
there
was
nothing
to
make
our
experience
sure


kant
was
very
shocked
by
and
saw
the
theory
he
had
learned
in
a
new
point
of
view


he
began
to
try
finding
a
third
way
other
than
the
two
that
kant
called
skepticism
and


kant
read
another
thinker
named
rousseau


his
thought
on
human
beings
especially
on
moral
human
freedom
and
perpetual
peace
<collocation>impressed kant</collocation>


philosophy
some
scholars
like
to
include
kant
as
one
of
the
german
idealists
but
kant
himself
did
not
belong
to
that
group


the
most
known
work
of
kant
is
the
book
critique
of
pure
reason
der
that
kant
published
in


kant
called
his
way
of
thought
critique
not
philosophy


kant
said
that
critique
was
a
preparation
for
establishment
of
real
philosophy


according
to
kant
for
that
establishment
people
should
know
what
human
reason
can
do
and
which
limits
it
has


in
the
critique
of
pure
reason
kant
wrote
several
limits
of
human
reason
to
both
feeling
and
thinking
something


for
sensation
there
are
two
limits
inside
of
human
perception
space
and
time


there
are
no
physical
objects
but
the
limitations
of
our
mind
that
work
whenever
we
feel
something
through
our
senses


for
thinking
he
said
there
are
twelve
categories
or
pure
<collocation>rational concepts</collocation>
divided
into
four
fields
quantity
quality
relation
and
modality


kant
thought
human
reason
applied
those
ideas
to
everything


ideology
is
what
we
think
only
our
fantasy


kant
said
no
although
without
those
sensual
and
<collocation>rational limitations</collocation>
we
can
think
nothing
then
kant
was
convinced
there
would
be
something
we
could
not
know
directly
behind
our
limitations
and
even
with
limitations
we
could
know
something


it
can
not
be
a
personal
fantasy
either
since
those
limitations
were
common
to
all
human
reason
before
our
particular
experience


kant
called
what
we
could
not
know
directly
ding
an
sich
thing
itself


we
can
think
thing
itself
but
can
not
have
any
experience
about
it
nor
know
it


god
the
eternity
of
soul
life
after
death
such
things
belong
to
thing
itself
so
they
were
not
right
objects
of
philosophy
according
to
kant
although
people
had
liked
to
discuss
them
from
ancient
times


books
kant
wrote
two
other
books
named
critique
too
critique
of
the
practical
reason
and
critique
of
the
judgement


in
critique
of
the
practical
reason
kant
wrote
about
the
problem
of
freedom
and
god


it
was
his
main
work
of
ethics


in
critique
of
the
judgement
kant
wrote
about
beauty
and
or
the
problem
if
there
was
a
purpose
in
general
if
the
world
a
living
creature
had
a
reason
to
exist
and
so
on


in
both
books
kant
said
we
could
not
answer
those
problems
because
they
were
concerned
with
thing
itself


influence
kant
had
a
great
influence
on
other
thinkers


in
the
century
german
philosophers
like
schelling
and
writers
like
herder
schiller
and
goethe
were
influenced
by
kant


in
the
early
century
kant
ideas
were
very
influential
on
one
group
of
german
philosophers


they
became
known
as
the


one
of
them
said
every
philosophy
before
kant
poured
into
kant
and
every
philosophy
after
kant
pours
from
kant

an

is
a

in
an

an

is
either
a
sister
of
someone
mother

of
your

that

cousin


a
or
is
the
sister
or
of
a
grandparent


in
many
cultures
no
single
word
such
as
aunt
describes
both
their
parents
sisters


instead
there
are
two
different
words
to
describe
a
person
relation
to
their
mother
sister
and
a
person
relation
to
their
father
sister


in
latin
for
example
a
mother
sister
is
while
a
father
sister
is


an

can
also
be
someone

about

ancient

the

character
homer
simpson
homer
and
his
guide
by
homer
is
the
name
of
the
greek
poet
who
wrote
the
<collocation>epic poems</collocation>
the
iliad
and
the
odyssey


these
are
the
earliest
works
of
greek
literature
which
have
survived
to
the
present
day
and
are
among
the
<collocation>greatest treasures</collocation>
of
the
ancient
world


they
are
a
product
of
mycenaean
culture


the
iliad
tells
the
story
of
the
trojan
war
which
took
place
around


the
manuscripts
of
homer
were
written
much
later
probably
later
than


the
history
what
makes
the
history
of
this
period
so
difficult
is
that
the
mycenaean
civilization
was
followed
by
several
<collocation>hundred years</collocation>
of
decline
from
which
little
or
no
writing
has
survived


this
period
the
greek
dark
age
ended
around
when
once
again
we
find
greek
writing
though
this
time
in
their
newly
developed
script


therefore
there
is
a
distinct
possibility
that
the
homeric
epics
had
a
life
perhaps
a
long
life
as
oral
literature
spoken
by


we
know
little
about
homer
and
the
later
greeks
also
knew
little
about
him


some
have
doubted
he
was
a
real
person
others
think
he
was
a
woman


a
legend
has
it
that
he
was
a
blind
poet
who
lived
in


there
is
no
definite
evidence
for
any
of
these
ideas


there
is
archaeological
evidence
that
troy
existed


the
site
of
troy
has
been
discovered
and
excavated


therefore
it
is
a
fair
guess
that
the
epic
began
as
a
long
oral
poem
based
on
the
siege
of
troy
but
with
details
added
and
changed
as
time
went
on


virtually
every
feature
of
homer
poetry
is
due
to
the
economy
forced
on
it
by
oral
methods
of
composition


the
date
of
homer
and
the
transcription
the
date
of
homer
existence
is
not
known


said
that
homer
lived
years
before
his
own
time
which
would
place
him
at
around
but
other
ancient
sources
gave
dates
much
closer
to
the
time
of
the
trojan
war


the
date
of
the
