according

no

controversy
some
people
think
the
<collocation>death penalty</collocation>
is
a
good
thing
and
others
think
it
is
a
bad
thing


many
people
on
both
sides
of
the
argument
have
very
strong
feelings


one
side
says
the
<collocation>death penalty</collocation>
is
good
because
it
scares
people
away
from
doing
things
that
could
get
them
killed
the
other
side
says
there
a
potential
of
executing
an
innocent
man
one
says
justice
retribution
and
punishment
the
other
side
says
that
execution
is
murder


most
people
know
the
threat
of
crime
to
their
lives
but
the
question
lies
in
the
methods
and
action
that
should
be
used
to
deal
with
it


throughout
human
history
governments
and
rulers
have
used
many
<collocation>death penalty</collocation>
methods
to
execute
people
such
as
crucifixion
flaying
and
hanging


some
methods
like
crucifixion
and
flaying
are
no
longer
used
by
governments
because
people
think
that
these
methods
of
killing
are
too
cruel


the
gas
chamber
was
found
unconstitutional
in
the
united
states
that
is
against
the
united
states
constitution
not
allowing
cruel
and
<collocation>unusual punishments</collocation>
and
is
no
longer
used


the
council
of

all
<collocation>death penalty</collocation>
by

of
the

convention

<collocation>amnesty international</collocation>
oppose
all
<collocation>death penalty</collocation>
on
ground
of
the
right
to
life
and
prohibition
of
all
tortures

any
cruel
inhuman
or

forms
of
execution
a
mannequin
is

in
a

position
of
a

in
the
device
the
following
forms
of
execution
are
in
use
today
<collocation>electric chair</collocation>
the
prisoner
is
killed
by
a
strong
source
of
electricity
attached
to
their
head
and
leg


lethal
injection
the
prisoner
is
poisoned
with
a
mix
of
chemicals
that
are
put
into
their
body


some
countries
use
chemicals
that
cause
controversy


firing
squad
some
people
shoot
the
prisoner
with
rifles


firing
squads
are
often
used
as
the
<collocation>death penalty</collocation>
for
soldiers
during
wars


one
or
more
of
those
firing
may
have
false
ammunition
that
does
not
kill
to
make
sure
that
nobody
can
brag
with
a
decisive
shot


firing
squad
is
traditional
military
execution
and
often
deserters
traitors
and
spies
are
shot


hanging
the
prisoner
has
a
rope
tied
around
their
neck


they
are
then
dropped
from
a
height


they
die
because
their
neck
is
broken
or
through
choking
asphyxiation
if
the
drop
is
too
small
or
knot
was
badly
made


if
the
drop
is
too
long
or
the
prisoner
too
heavy
the
result
may
be
their
head
being
torn
off


japan
india
and
former
british
colonies
use
hanging


strangulation
by
hand
or
by
garrote


the
garrote
was
the
principal
device
for
capital
punishment
in
spain
for
hundreds
of
years


originally
the
convict
was
killed
by
hitting
him
with
a
club
garrote
in
spanish


this
later
developed
into
putting
a
loop
of
rope
placed
around
the
neck


a
wooden
stick
was
placed
in
the
loop
and
rotated
to
tighten
the
rope
until
the
condemned
person
was
strangled
to
death


stoning
stones
are
thrown
at
the
prisoner
until
they
die


stoning
is
still
used
in
some
middle
eastern
countries


decapitation
the
victim
has
his
or
her
head
cut
off
with
a
sharp
blade
such
as
sword
axe
or
guillotine


this
was
the
traditional
means
of
execution
in
central
europe


decapitation
is
also
called
beheading

overview
condoms
are
rolled
up
when
they
are
packaged
and
are
meant
to
be
rolled
over
an
erect
penis


they
are
most
commonly
made
of
latex
but
are
available
in
other
materials


condoms
normally
have
an
expiration
date
on
them


condoms
weaken
after
this
date
and
may
not
work
properly


condoms
are
also
not
designed
to
be

more
than

it
is
important
to
know
how
to
use
a
condom
before

if
a

is

may

this
happens
a

when
using
a
condom
for
the
first
time
it
could
help
to
try
using
it
alone
to
get
familiar
with
condoms
without
any
danger


nowadays
women
also
can
use
condoms


like
male
condoms
they
increase
protection
for
partners
from
pregnancy
and
std


female
condoms
look
like
a
sheath
with
a
flexible
ring
on
both
sides
of
this
sheath


with
these
rings
the
condom
is
attached
to
the
vagina


it
covers
the
vagina
and
cervix
to
prevent
sperm
from
getting
inside
the
woman
uterus


it
is
necessary
to
know
that
female
and
male
condom
should
not
be
used
at
the
same
time


in
this
case
both
condoms
may

against

journal
of
health
showed
that
all
women
who
correctly
and
consistently
used
reality
were
protected
from
referring
to
a
particular
brand
of
female
condom


causes
of
failure
the
most
common
reason
for
a
condom
failing
is
that
the
user
has
not
put
it
on
properly


a
condom
can
also
fail
because
it
has
been
damaged
because
the
latex
has
weakened
or
because
it
has
come
off
the
penis
during
<collocation>sexual intercourse</collocation>


something
else
that
can
cause
a
condom
to
not
work
as
it
should
is
sabotage


this
is
when
one
of
the
partners
wants
a
baby
but
the
other
one
does
not


usually
they
pierce
a
condom
with
a
sharp
object
making
the
<collocation>condom useless</collocation>


some
people
see
it
as
not
ethical
because
one
of
the
two
sex
partners
does
it
without
the
other
one
knowledge


there
are
websites
that
show
how
to
do
it
if
the
woman
wants
a
baby
but
the
man
does
not


one
method
of
testing
condoms
for
microscopic
holes
involves
placing
the
condom
being
tested
over
one
conducting
form
with
another
on
the
other
side
of
the
condom


if
the
condom
does
not
prevent
an
electric
current
from
flowing
between
the
two
conducting
forms
it
fails
the
test


holes
in
condoms
are
unlikely
if
proper
handling
conditions
see
below
are
followed


arguments
against
condom
use
arguments
by
religious
communities
several
religious
communities
like
catholic
christians
muslims
and
some
protestant
christians
see
problems
if
condoms
are
used
they
say
there
is
a
difference
in
having
sex
for
making
babies
and
having
sex
for
fun
to
make
the
relationship
between
the
partners
stronger


they
say
that
using
a
condom
to
prevent
a
pregnancy
is
bad


rather
than
using
a
condom
natural
methods
should
be
used
to
prevent
pregnancy


such
methods
include
choosing
the
time
of
the
month
carefully


this
does
not
stop
sexually
transmitted
diseases
other
communities
are
not
as
strict
and
only
look
at
the
result


they
leave
it
to
those
involved
to
choose
the
correct
means


some
people
say
the
use
of
condom
is
against
nature
unnatural
