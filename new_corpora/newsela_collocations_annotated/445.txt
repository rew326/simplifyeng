hitchhiker
in
luxembourg
hitchhiking
is
a
way
that
people
can
travel
from
one
place
to
another


usually
a
hitchhiker
a
person
who
hitchhikes
will
stand
at
the
side
of
a
road
and
hold
his
or
her
thumb
in
the
air


this
is
a
sign
that
he
or
she
wants
a
car
to
stop
and
pick
up


the
distance
traveled
by
hitchhiking
can
be
anywhere
from
walking
distance
to
across
a
continent


hitchhiking
is
against
the
law
in
some
areas
for
example
around
a
prison
in
the
united
states


it
was
a
very
common
way
of
traveling
in
europe
in
the
and
is
still
done
by
many
people
all
over
the
world

owls
are
birds
in
the
order


there
are
species
and
they
are
all
birds
of
prey


most
of
them
are
solitary
and
nocturnal
in
fact
they
are
the
only
large
group
of
birds
which
hunt
at
night


owls
are
specialists
at
hunting


they
feed
on
small
mammals
such
as
rodents
insects
and
other
birds
and
a
few
species
like
to
eat
fish
as
well


as
a
group
owls
are
very
successful


they
are
found
in
all
parts
of
the
world
except
antarctica
most
of
greenland
and
some
other
small
islands

owl
families
there
are

owls

true
owls
and
the
<collocation>barn owls</collocation>
true
owls
the
family
species
in
genera
<collocation>barn owls</collocation>
the
family


this
contains
the
genus
especially
alba
with
its
many


the
genus
has
only
a
couple
of
species
known
as


hunts
mainly
by
sound


adaptations
owls
have
a
suite
of
adaptations
which
help
them
to
be
successful


owls
have
large
eyes
and
holes
for
ears
a
hawk
like
beak
and
a
rather
flat
face


most
birds
of
prey
have
eyes
on
the
sides
of
their
heads
but
the
owl
eyes
are
facing
forwards
to
help
it
see
better
in
the
dark


their
eyes
are
also
fixed
inside
their
sockets
so
they
have
to
turn
their
whole
head
to
look
at
other
things


owls
can
rotate
their
heads
and
necks
up
to
degrees
in
both
directions


owls
are
good
at
looking
at
things
far
from
its
eyes
but
it
can
not
see
anything
clearly
within
a
few
centimeters
of
their
eyes


owls
use
small
feathers
on
the
beak
and
the
feet
that
help
it
feel
the
prey
it
catches


hunting
most
owls
hunt
at
night
and
in
twilight
dawn
and
dusk


a
few
owls
are
also
active
during
the
day


the
owls
hunting
depends
on
surprising
its
prey


their
most
important
adaptation
is
their
almost
silent
flight


the
feathers
are
soft
with
fringes
on
the
back
edge
and
the
base
of
each
is
downy


this
all
muffles
noise
and
makes
for
silence


also
coming
in
for
the
kill
they
glide


the
dull
colors
of
the
owls
feathers
make
them
less
visible
by
camouflaging
the
owl


this
helps
them
as
they
roost
during
the
day


also
they
have
fantastic
hearing


the
shape
of
the
head
helps
slight
sounds
reach
the
ears


the
feathers
of
the
<collocation>facial disc</collocation>
are
arranged
in
order
to
increase
sound
delivered
to
the
ears


their
ears
are
asymmetrical
allowing
the
owl
to
locate
a
sound


they
can
hear
a
mouse
move
in
the
grass


an
owl
sharp
beak
and
<collocation>powerful talons</collocation>
allow
it
to
kill
its
prey
before
swallowing
it
whole
unless
it
is
too
big


owls
usually
regurgitate
the
parts
of
their
prey
that
they
can
not
digest


these
parts
include
bones
scales
and
fur


scientists
who
study
the
things
that
owls
eat
can
get
clues
by
studying
the
parts
that
the
<collocation>owl spit</collocation>
back
out
called
owl
pellets


these
owl
pellets
are
often
sold
by
companies
to
schools
for
use
in
the
students
biology
and
ecology
lessons


the
head
owls
have
special
adaptations
which
help
them
swivel
their
heads
degrees


they
have
<collocation>neck vertebrae</collocation>
instead
of
our
seven


also
the
big
carotid
arteries
instead
of
being
on
the
side
of
the
neck
as
in
humans
are
carried
close
to
the
center
of
rotation
just
in
front
of
the
spine


so
these
arteries
get
much
less
twisting
and
stretching
and
the
potential
for
damage
is
greatly
reduced


this
arrangement
is
seen
in
other
birds
but
in
owls
the
vertebral
arteries
the
vessels
that
travel
through
channels
in
the
neck
bones
are
given
extra
space


owls
also
have
wide
parts
in
their
carotid
arteries
just
under
the
base
of
the
skull


researchers
found
these
could
dilate
and
fill
with
a
reservoir
of
blood


we
believe
this
is
kind
of
a
new
structure
not
really
known
before
said
a
researcher


it
probably
a
way
to
pool
blood
and
get
some
continuity
of
flow
even
if
there
is
disruption
below
at
the
next
level

<collocation>copyright infringement</collocation>
or
copyright
violation
is
the

is

by

in

that
violates

of

the
slang
<collocation>term bootleg</collocation>
from
the
use
of
boots
to

items
is
often
used
to
describe
illegally
copied
material


some
people
call
copying
of
movies
and
music
that
copyright
does
not
allow
piracy
or
theft


richard
stallman
says
people
should
not
call
copying
and
distribution
piracy
because
piracy
is
robbery
with
attacking
ships
killing
and
stealing
people
and
owners
of
copyright
use
the
word
to
say
that
such
copying
is
same
evil
as
piracy


some
courts
say
that
the
word
piracy
may
be
used
but
the
word
theft
may
not
be
used


when
people
use
the
word
piracy
for
<collocation>copyright infringement</collocation>
it
usually

almost

piracy

the

why

here
are
some
motivations
that
attract
people
to
do
that


as
we
all
know
<collocation>copyright infringement</collocation>
is
usually
at
low
price
because
they
do
need
to

so
it

who

important
reason

<collocation>genuine goods</collocation>

sometimes

on

international
women
day
is
celebrated
every
year
on
march


international
women
day
has
been
observed
since
in
the
united
states


after
a
while
the
people
of
the
united
states
stopped
celebrating
this
holiday


in
the
soviet
union
and
then
some
other
communist
countries
like
china
cuba
started
celebrating
this
day
as
a
holiday
for
women
and
world
peace


since
then
the
holiday
has
become
more
and
more
popular
around
the
world


in
many
places
the
day
does
not
have
a
political
aspect
and
is
simply
a
time
for
men
to
express
their
love
for
women
in
a
way
similar
to
a
mixture
of
mother
day
and
valentine
day


men
present
their
mothers
wives
girlfriends
colleagues
with
flowers
and
small
gifts


in
some
countries
international
women
day
is
observed
like
mother
day
where
children
give
small
gifts
to
their
mothers
and
grandmothers


in
some
countries
women
get
a
half
day
off
work


often
schools
will
have
a
celebration
where
students
will
honor
their
teachers


in
the
united
nations
also
started
to
recognize
this
holiday


the
un
chooses
a
political
or
social
theme
for
the
holiday
each
year


for
example
the
theme
is
equal
access
to
education
training
and
science
and
technology
pathway
to
decent
work
for

in
this
way
the
holiday
is
a
time
to

at
the
social
and
economic
problems
