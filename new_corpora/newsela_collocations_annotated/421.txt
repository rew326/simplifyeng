the
word
relativity
usually
means
two
things
in
physics
the
principle
of
relativity
which
was
originally
thought
up
by
galileo
galilei
and
later
used
by
albert
einstein
as
one
of
the
important
postulates
like
rules
of
the
theory
of
relativity


the
theory
of
relativity
itself
which
has
two
parts
special
relativity
and
general
relativity


in
the
physics
of
aristotle
heavy
objects
fall
faster
than
objects
that
are
not
heavy


the
natural
science
of
aristotle
was
most
popular
in
western
thought
for
years


galileo
proved
that
all
objects
fall
with
the
same
acceleration


therefore
the
longer
an
object
moves
with
<collocation>constant acceleration</collocation>
the
faster
its
final
velocity
is


also
if
different
objects
each
having
a
different
mass
are
dropped
from
rest
initial
velocity
is
zero
at
the
same
height
in
a
vacuum
they
will
all
hit
the
ground
at
the
same
velocity
regardless
of
their
mass


the
experimental
discoveries
of
galileo
and
the
laws
of
motion
developed
mathematically
by
newton
gave
birth
to
modern
science


galileo
principle
of
relativity
states
it
is
impossible
by
mechanical
means
to
say
whether
we
are
moving
or
staying
at
rest


if
two
trains
are
moving
at
the
same
speed
in
the
same
direction
then
a
passenger
in
either
car
will
not
be
able
to
notice
that
either
train
is
moving


however
if
the
passenger
takes
a
fixed
frame
of
reference
a
fixed
point
like
the
earth
he
will
then
be
able
to
notice
the
motion
of
either
train


another
thing
if
one
stands
on
the
earth
one
will
not
be
able
to
see
that
it
is
moving


this
principle
is
just
taken
from
observation


for
example
if
we
are
traveling
by
airplane
at
a
constant
speed
we
can
walk
through
the
inside
of
the
airplane
without
noticing
anything
special


from
a
practical
point
of
view
this
means
that
newton
laws
of
motion
are
valid
in
all
inertial
systems
which
means
those
at
rest
or
those
moving
with
constant
speed
relative
to
one
considered
at
rest


this
is
the
law
of
inertia
a
body
at
rest
continues
at
rest
and
a
body
in
motion
continues
in
motion
in
a
straight
line
unless
influenced
by
an
external
force


a
galilean
coordinate
system
is
one
where
the
law
of
inertia
is
valid


the
laws
of
mechanics
of
galileo
and
newton
are
valid
in
a
galilean
coordinate
system


if
k
is
a
galilean
coordinate
system
then
every
other
system
k
is
a
coordinate
system
if
it
lies
at
rest
or
moves
according
to
the
law
of
inertia
relative
to
k


relative
to
k
the
mechanical
laws
of
galileo
and
newton
are
as
valid
as
they
are
relative
to
k


if
relative
to
k
k
is
a
coordinate
system
moving
according
to
the
law
of
inertia
and
is
devoid
of
rotation
then
the
laws
of
nature
obey
the
same
general
principles
in
k
as
they
do
in
k


this
statement
is
known
as
the
principle
of
relativity


in
other
words
if
a
mass
m
is
at
rest
or
is
moving
with
<collocation>constant acceleration</collocation>
the
<collocation>constant acceleration</collocation>
could
be
equal
to
zero
in
which
case
the
velocity
would
remain
constant
in
a
straight
line
relative
to
a
galilean
coordinate
system
k
then
it
will
also
be
at
rest
or
moving
with
<collocation>constant acceleration</collocation>
in
a
straight
line
relative
to
a
second
coordinate
system
k
provided
the
law
of
inertia
is
valid
in
system
k
in
other
words
provided
it
is
a
galilean
coordinate
system


therefore
if
we
want
to
observe
an
effect
in
a
moving
system
at
constant
speed
we
can
apply
the
newton
laws
directly


if
the
moving
system
speeds
up
or
we
speed
up
relative
to
it
like
looking
at
the
stars
from
the
earth
then
we
will
have
to
introduce
imaginary
forces
to
compensate
this
effect


these
fictitious
forces
are
called
centrifugal
force
and
force


newton
laws
of
motion
are
mechanically
accurate
for
speeds
that
are
slow
compared
with
the
velocity
of
light


for
speeds
that
approach
the
speed
of
light
it
is
necessary
to
apply
the
discoveries
of
einstein
special
theory
of
relativity


in
order
to
describe
what
happens
mechanically
in
the
universe
physicists
use
mass
length
and
time


in
the
physics
of
galileo
and
newton
these
quantities
remain
the
same
throughout
the
universe


with
einstein
special
theory
of
relativity
these
quantities
can
change


special
relativity
or
the
special
theory
of
relativity
was
developed
and
explained
by
albert
einstein
in
because
of
some
weaknesses
that
had
been
discovered
in
older
physics


for
example
older
physics
could
not
explain
the
constant
speed
of
light


einstein
believed
that
these
physics
theories
gave
unspoken
preference
to
one
group
of
observers
viewers
over
another
group
of
observers


galileo
had
established
the
principle
of
relativity
according
to
which
physics
events
must
look
the
same
to
all
observers
and
no
observer
can
be
said
to
have
the
right
way
to
look
at
the
things
studied
by
physics


however
his
equation
did
not
hold
for
some
phenomena
such
as
the
speed
of
light


according
to
galileo
the
measured
speed
of
light
should
be
different
for
different
speeds
of
the
observer
and
its
source


however
the
experiment
showed
that
this
is
not
true
at
least
not
for
all
cases

basics

general

suppose
that
you
are
moving
toward
something
that
is
moving
toward
you


if
you
measure
its
speed
it
will
seem
to
be
moving
faster
than
if
you
were
not
moving


now
suppose
you
are
moving
away
from
something
that
is
moving
toward
you


if
you
measure
its
speed
again
it
will
seem
to
be
moving
more
slowly


this
is
the
idea
of
relative
speed
the
speed
of
the
object
relative
to
you


before
albert
einstein
scientists
were
trying
to
measure
the
relative
speed
of
light


they
were
doing
this
by
measuring
the
speed
of
starlight
reaching
the
earth


they
expected
that
if
the
earth
were
moving
toward
a
star
the
light
from
that
star
should
seem
faster
than
if
the
earth
were
moving
away
from
that
star


they
noticed
that
no
matter
who
performed
the
experiments
where
they
were
performed
or
what
starlight
they
used
the
measured
speed
of
light
in
a
vacuum
was
always
the
same


einstein
said
this
happens
because
there
is
something
unexpected
about
length
and
duration


he
thought
that
as
the
earth
moves
through
space
all
measurable
change
ever
so
slightly


any
clock
used
to
measure
some
duration
will
give
a
duration
off
by
exactly
the
right
amount
so
that
the
speed
of
light
remains
the
same


mentally
constructing
a
light
clock
allows
us
to
better
understand
this
remarkable
fact
for
the
case
of
a
single
light
wave


also
einstein
said
that
as
the
earth
moves
through
space
all
measurable
lengths
change
ever
so
slightly


any
device
measuring
length
will
give
a
length
off
by
exactly
the
right
amount
so
that
the
speed
of
light
remains
the
same


the
most
difficult
thing
to
understand
however
is
that
events
that
appear
to
be
simultaneous
in
one
frame
may
not
be
simultaneous
in
another
frame


this
has
several
effects
that
are
not
intuitively
obvious


since
the
length
of
an
object
is
the
distance
from
head
to
tail
at
one
<collocation>simultaneous moment</collocation>
it
follows
that
if
two
observers
disagree
about
what
events
are
simultaneous
then
this
will
effect
sometimes
dramatically
their
measurements
of
the
length
of
objects


furthermore
if
a
line
of
clocks
appear
synchronized
to
a
<collocation>stationary observer</collocation>
and
appear
to
be
out
of
sync
to
that
same
observer
after
accelerating
to
a
certain
velocity
then
it
follows
that
during
the
acceleration
the
clocks
ran
at
different
speeds


some
may
even
run
backwards


this
line
of
reasoning
leads
to
general
relativity


other
scientists
before
einstein
had
written
about
light
seeming
to
go
the
same
speed
no
matter
how
it
was
observed


what
made
einstein
theory
so
revolutionary
is
that
it
considers
the
measurement
of
the
speed
of
light
to
be
constant
by
definition
in
other
words
it
is
a
law
of
nature


this
has
the
remarkable
implications
that
length
and
duration
change
in
order
to
accommodate
this


the
transformations
the
mathematical
bases
of
special
relativity
are
the
transformations
which
mathematically
describe
the
views
of
space
and
time
for
two
observers
who
are
moving
with
respect
to
each
other
but
are
not
experiencing
acceleration


to
define
the
transformations
we
use
a
coordinate
system
to
mathematically
describe
the
time
and
space
of
events


each
observer
can
describe
an
event
as
the
position
of
something
in
space
at
a
certain
time
using
coordinates
x
y
z
t


the
location
of
the
event
is
defined
in
the
first
three
coordinates
x
y
z
in
relation
to
an
arbitrary
center
so
that
is
a
diagonal
going
units
of
distance
like
meters
or
miles
out
in
each
direction


the
time
of
the
event
is
described
with
the
fourth
<collocation>coordinate t</collocation>
in
relation
to
an
arbitrary
point
in
time
in
some
unit
of
time
like
seconds
or
hours
or
years


let
there
be
an
observer
k
who
describes
when
events
occur
with
a
time
<collocation>coordinate t</collocation>
and
who
describes
where
events
occur
with
spatial
coordinates
x
y
and
z


this
is
mathematically
defining
the
first
observer
whose
point
of
view
will
be
our
first
reference


let
us
specify
that
the
time
of
an
event
is
given
by
the
time
that
it
is
observed
t
observed
say
today
at
minus
the
time
that
it
took
for
the
observation
to
reach
us


this
can
be
calculated
as
the
distance
from
the
observer
to
the
event
d
observed
say
the
event
is
on
a
star
which
is
light
year
away
so
it
takes
the
light
year
to
reach
the
observer
divided
by
c
the
speed
of
light
several
million
miles
per
hour
which
we
define
as
being
the
same
for
all
observers


this
is
correct
because
distance
divided
by
speed
gives
the
time
it
takes
to
go
that
distance
at
that
speed
miles
divided
by
mph
give
us
hours
because
if
you
go
at
mph
for
hours
you
reach
miles


so
we
have
t
this
is
mathematically
defining
what
any
time
means
for
any
observer


now
with
these
definitions
in
place
let
there
be
another
observer
k
who
is
moving
along
the
x
axis
of
k
at
a
rate
of
v
has
a
<collocation>spatial coordinate</collocation>
system
of
x
y
and
z
where
x
axis
is
coincident
with
the
x
axis
and
with
the
y
and
z
axes
always
being
parallel
to
the
y
and
z
axes


this
means
that
when
k
the
second
observer
gives
a
location
like
the
x
which
is
in
this
example
is
the
same
place
that
k
the
first
observer
would
be
talking
about
but
the
on
the
y
axis
or
the
on
the
z
axis
are
only
parallel
to
some
location
on
the
k
observer
coordinate
system


and
where
k
and
k
are
coincident
at
t
t
this
means
that
the
coordinate
is
the
same
event
for
both
observers


in
other
words
both
observers
have
at
least
one
time
and
location
that
both
agree
on
which
is
location
and
time
zero


the
transformations
then
are

a
frequently
made

in
some
books
is
to
rewrite
these
equation
using
a
relativistic
mass
in
the
direction
of
motion
of
m
v
c


the
fact
why
this
is
incorrect
is
that
the
light
for
example
has
no
mass
but
has
energy


if
we
use
this
formula
the
photon
particule
of
light
has
a

which
is
according
to
experiments
incorrect


in
special

and
momentum
are

history
the
need
for
special
relativity
arose
from
maxwell
equations
of
electromagnetism
which
were
published
in


it
was
later
found
that
they
call
for
electromagnetic
waves
such
as
light
to
move
at
a
constant
speed
the
speed
of
light


to
have
james
clerk
maxwell
equations
be
consistent
with
both
<collocation>astronomical observations</collocation>
and
<collocation>newtonian physics</collocation>
maxwell
proposed
in
that
light
travels
through
an
ether
which
is
everywhere
in
the
universe


in
the
famous
experiment
tried
to
detect
the
<collocation>ether wind</collocation>
generated
by
the
movement
of
the
earth


the
persistent
null
results
of
this
experiment
puzzled
physicists
and
called
the
ether
theory
into
question


in
and
noted
that
the
null
result
of
the
experiment
could
be
explained
by
the
<collocation>ether wind</collocation>
contracting
the
experiment
in
the
direction
of
motion
of
the
ether


this
effect
is
called
the
contraction
and
without
ether
is
a
consequence
of
special
relativity


in
first
published
the
equations


although
this
was
not
the
first
time
they
had
been
published
this
was
the
first
time
that
they
were
used
as
an
explanation
of
the
experiment
null
result
since
the
contraction
is
a
result
of
them


in
gave
a
famous
speech
in
which
he
considered
the
possibility
that
some
new
physics
was
needed
to
explain
the
experiment


in
showed
that
electrical
and
<collocation>magnetic fields</collocation>
can
be
modified
into
each
other
through
the
transformations


in
einstein
published
his
article
introducing
special
relativity
on
the
of
moving
bodies
in
der


in
this
article
he
presented
the
postulates
of
relativity
derived
the
transformations
from
them
and
unaware
of
article
also
showed
how
the
transformations
affect
electric
and
<collocation>magnetic fields</collocation>


later
in
einstein
published
another
article
presenting
e
mc


in
max
endorsed
einstein
theory
and
named
it
relativity


in
that
same
year
gave
a
famous
speech
on
space
and
time
in
which
he
showed
that
relativity
is
and
further
developed
the
theory


these
events
forced
the
physics
community
to
take
relativity
seriously


relativity
came
to
be
more
and
more
accepted
after
that


in
einstein
and
were
nominated
for
the
nobel
prize
in
physics
due
to
their
pioneering
work
on
relativity


unfortunately
relativity
was
so
controversial
then
and
controversial
for
such
a
long
time
that
a
nobel
prize
was
never
awarded
for
it


experimental
confirmations
the
experiment
which
failed
to
detect
any
difference
in
the
speed
of
light
based
on
the
direction
of
the
light
movement


experiment
in
which
the
index
of
refraction
for
light
in
moving
water
can
not
be
made
to
be
less
than


the
observed
results
are
explained
by
the
relativistic
rule
for
adding
velocities


the
energy
and
momentum
of
light
obey
the
equation
e
pc


in
<collocation>newtonian physics</collocation>
this
is
expected
to
be
e
begin
matrix
end
matrix
pc


the
transverse
<collocation>doppler effect</collocation>
which
is
where
the
light
emitted
by
a
quickly
moving
object
is
due
to
time
dilation


the
presence
of
created
in
the
upper
atmosphere
at
the
surface
of
the
earth


the
issue
is
that
it
takes
much
longer
than
the
of
the
to
get
down
to
the
surface
of
the
earth
even
at
nearly
the
speed
of
light


their
presence
can
be
seen
as
either
being
due
to
time
dilation
in
our
view
or
<collocation>length contraction</collocation>
of
the
distance
to
the
surface
of
the
earth
in
the
muon
view


<collocation>particle accelerators</collocation>
can
not
be
constructed
without
accounting
for
relativistic
physics


notes
observations
of
binary
stars
show
that
light
takes
the
same
amount
of
time
to
reach
the
earth
over
the
same
distance
for
both
stars
in
such
systems


if
the
speed
of
light
was
constant
with
respect
to
its
source
the
light
from
the
approaching
star
would
arrive
sooner
than
the
light
from
the
receding
star


this
would
cause
binary
stars
to
appear
to
move
in
ways
that
violate
laws
but
this
is
not
seen


the
second
postulate
of
special
relativity
that
the
speed
of
light
is
the
same
for
all
observers
contradicts
<collocation>newtonian physics</collocation>


since
the
earth
is
constantly
being
accelerated
as
it
orbits
the
sun
the
<collocation>initial null</collocation>
result
was
not
a
concern


however
that
did
mean
that
a
strong
<collocation>ether wind</collocation>
should
have
been
present
months
later
but
none
was
observed
