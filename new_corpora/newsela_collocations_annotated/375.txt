very
popular
with
members

counterculture


this
was
because
of
the
movies
strange
and
visuals


when
the

released
it
was
both
loved
and
hated
by
many
movie
critics


many
of
the
movie
critics
who
did
not
like
the
movie
when
they
saw
it
in
have
changed
their
opinions


some

written
a
second
positive
review
of

many
years
later


a

based
on
a
novel
of
the
same
title
by

burgess


the
novel
and
movie
are
about
a
criminal
who
is
given
a
new
and
experimental
cure
for
his
violent
nature


the
story
asks
questions
about
how
society
defines
morality


the
movie
had
an
amount
of
sex
and
violence
that
was
not
often
seen
in
big
hollywood
movies
at
the
time


the
controversy
of
the
movie
increased
when
other
people
copied
some
of
the
acts
that
were
committed
by
the
characters
in
the
movie


and
his
family
received
violent
threats
from
people
called
death
threats


these
threats
were
serious
enough
that
took
the
movie
out
of
theaters
in
britain


the
movie
was
not
shown
again
in
britain
until
the
year
after

released
before
his
own


worked
very
hard
researching
and
learning
about
napoleon
and
about
the
world
at
that
time


chose
to
make
another
movie
set
in
that
time
that
was
titled
barry


the
movie
was
based
a
book
by
william
and
was
about
an
century
gambler
named
barry


the
movie
was
not
as
well
liked
as
his
previous
movies
but
like
a
<collocation>space odyssey</collocation>
it
convinced
people
over
time


after
barry
made
movies
at
a
much
slower
rate
than
before


he
only
made
three
more
movies
in
the
next
years


he
was
still
very
popular
and
respected


each
of
the
movies
he
released
became
an
event
that

for
and
celebrated

it
during
an
important
scene
in
the
movie


the
author
of
the
book
stephen
king
hated
the
movie
and
did
not
like
that
changed
many
things
from
the
book

for
the
united
nations
<collocation>framework convention</collocation>
on
<collocation>climate change</collocation>
that
tries
to
reduce
the
effects
of
<collocation>climate change</collocation>
such
as
global
warming


the
plan
says
that
countries
that
adopt
follow
the
<collocation>kyoto protocol</collocation>
have
to
try
to
reduce
how
much
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
and
other
<collocation>greenhouse gases</collocation>
that
pollute
the
atmosphere
they
release
into
the
air


the
full
name
of
the
<collocation>kyoto protocol</collocation>
is
the
<collocation>kyoto protocol</collocation>
to
the
united
nations
<collocation>framework convention</collocation>
on
<collocation>climate change</collocation>


it
is
called
the
<collocation>kyoto protocol</collocation>
because
it
was
made
in
kyoto
japan


the
<collocation>kyoto protocol</collocation>
was
officially
put
into
full
force
on
february


on
february
russia
began
to
follow
ratify
the
<collocation>kyoto protocol</collocation>
and
it
was
decided
to
be
put
into
full
force


as
of
february
countries
have
agreed
to
follow
the
<collocation>kyoto protocol</collocation>
who
make
up
for
more
than
of
the
<collocation>greenhouse gases</collocation>
released
into
our
atmosphere


there
are
still
countries
which
have
not
yet
adopted
it


and
have
signed
the
treaty
but
have
not
ratified
it
made
it
a
law
they
have
to
follow


the
united
states
of
america
has
signed
it
but
said
that
they
will
not
ratify
it


australia
has
only
recently
ratified
the
<collocation>kyoto protocol</collocation>
under
the
previous
<collocation>prime minister</collocation>
john


both
of
these
countries
have
said
that
the
fact
that
china
and
india
are
using
exceptions
to
the
treaty
those
countries
believe
parts
of
the
treaty
do
not
apply
to
them
and
they
will
not
follow
those
parts
in
the
name
of
industrialization
is
unfair
and
that
they
will
not
ratify
because
of
this
although
it
is
believed
that
the
and
australia
are
protecting
their
economic
interests
by
not
ratifying


the
countries
leaders
say
that
changing
their
use
of
<collocation>greenhouse gases</collocation>
will
make
their
people
lose
jobs


the
twenty
four
other
countries
have
neither
signed
nor
ratified
the
treaty

a
movie
director
is
a
person
who
helps
lead
the
making
of
a
movie
or
film


they
take
care
of
the
artistic
things
in
the
movie


they
give
instructions
to
the
actors
and
direct
the
people
that
work
on
the
movie


directors
give
many
of
their
responsibilities
to
other
members
of
their
team
called
a
movie
crew


for
example
the
person
who
is
responsible
for
the
lighting
is
told
by
the
director
what
style
of
lighting
he
wants
and
he
then
creates
the
lighting
for
him


it
is
common
for
movie
directors
to
work
closely
with
a
movie
producer


movie
producers
are
people
who
control
the
side
of
movie
making


for
example
they
control
all
the
money
that
is
used
for
making
the
movie


the
amount
of
control
a
director
has
in
creating
their
movie
is
different
for
each
director


it
is
most
common
for
directors
to
have
some
control
while
the
rest
of
the
is
controlled
by
the
movie
studio
the
area
where
the
movies
are
made
and
by
the
people
who
pay
for
the
movie


this
was
very
common
for
american
movies
made
in
the
to


during
those
years
the
studios
used
many
different
directors
for
making
a
single
movie


there
are
a
small
number
of
directors
who
are
given
<collocation>complete control</collocation>
over
making
their
movie


for
example
stanley
steven
and
james
are
all
movie
directors
who
had
a
great
amount
of
control
in
making
their
movie
