have
been

radar
uses
radio
waves
to
see
distant
objects
by
bouncing
waves
off
an
object
and
seeing
how
long
it
takes
for
the

radar
can
even
be
used
to
find

or
see
what
chemicals
are
in

radios
also
use
these
waves
to
send
and
receive
information


natural
radio
waves
were
first
discovered
in
the
by
working
for
bell
laboratories


before
his
discovery
everyone
thought
only
people
could
generate
radio
waves


bell
was
detecting
static
on
his
radio
channels
and
had
try
to
figure
out
where
this
static
or
interference
was
coming
from


surprisingly
the
interference
was
coming
from
space


this
discovery
eventually
led
astronomers
to
look
at
radio
waves
along
with
light
waves
to
find
things
in
the
sky


these
radio
astronomers
use
giant
radio
telescopes
shaped

satellite
dishes
to
gather

study
the

western
art
music
classical
music
from
to
classical
music
period
classical
music
is
a
very
general
term
which
normally
refers
to
the
standard
music
of
countries
in
the
western
world


it
is
music
that
has
been
composed
by
musicians
who
are
trained
in
the
art
of
writing
music
composing
and
written
down
in
music
notation
so
that
other
musicians
can
play
it


classical
music
can
also
be
described
as
art
music
because
great
art
is
needed
to
compose
it
and
to
perform
it
well


classical
music
differs
from
pop
music
because
it
is
not
made
just
in
order
to
be
popular
for
a
short
time
or
just
to
be
a
commercial
success


it
is
different
from
folk
music
which
is
generally
made
up
by
ordinary
members
of
society
and
learned
by
future
generations
by
listening
and
copying

conclusion
references
meaning
of
classic
the
word
classic
tends
to
mean
an
art
which
is
so
good
that
it
will
always
be
enjoyed
by
future
generations


it
is
something
that
has
become
a
model
for
future
artists


the
period
of
ancient
greece
and
rome
is
known
as
the
classical
period
because
many
centuries
later
people
looked
back
to
those
ancient
civilizations
and
thought
they
were
perfect


in
recent
european
history
the
century
was
known
as
the
classical
period
because
musicians
artists
writers
and
philosophers
were
inspired
by
the
art
forms
of
the
classical
period
of
ancient
greece
and
rome


something
that
is
a
classic
is
therefore
something
that
will
always
be
remembered
as
something
great


famous
books
such
as
the
novels
of
charles
dickens
are
called
classics


classical
music
therefore
tends
to
mean
music
that
will
not
be
forgotten
soon
after
it
is
written
but
is
likely
to
be
enjoyed
by
many
future
generations


contrast
with
pop
music
and
jazz
although
people
sometimes
think
of
classical
music
as
the
opposite
of
pop
music
it
can
still
be
very
popular


like
all
kinds
of
music
classical
music
can
be
in
many
different
moods
happy
sad
scary
peaceful
thoughtful
simple


mozart
wrote
his
serenades
and
to
entertain
people
at
parties


classical
pieces
of
music
can
be
quite
short
but
they
can
also
be
very
long
like
a
big
musical
story


a
symphony
by
or
can
last
for
nearly
an
hour
and
an
opera
is
a
whole
evening
entertainment


classical
music
is
also
different
from
jazz
because
true
jazz
is
improvised


however
the
differences
are
not
always
obvious


classical
music
has
often
been
inspired
by
jazz
and
jazz
by
classical
music


george
wrote
music
which
is
both
jazz
and
classical


classical
music
too
can
be
improvised


the
great
composers
bach
mozart
and
beethoven
often
improvised
long
pieces
of
music
on
the
organ
harpsichord
or
piano


sometimes
they
wrote
these
down


they
were
in

compositions
which
were
composed
in

go


religious
and
music
<collocation>cathedral choir</collocation>
in
western
countries
a
vast
amount
of
music
was
written
for
christian
worship
in
churches
and
cathedrals


this
is
called
sacred
religious
music


all
other
music
is
secular
music


the
word
secular
means
things
that
are
not
sacred


sacred
and
secular
music
have
influenced
one
another
in
many
ways
during
the
course
of
music
history


secular
music
was
largely
influenced
by
dance
and
this
in
turn
changed
the
style
of
sacred
music


for
example
the
church
music
of
the
century
composer
da
has
nothing
to
do
with
dance
music
but
both
the
sacred
and
secular
music
of
bach
two
centuries
later
is
full
of
<collocation>dance rhythms</collocation>


at
some
times
in
music
history
there
have
been
different
styles
of
composing
for
sacred
and
for
secular
music


uses
two
different
styles
for
his
church
and
for
his
music


when
composers
were
experimenting
with
new
ways
of
writing
music
they
usually
did
this
with
secular
music
and
sacred
music
caught
up
later


use
of
the
term
classical
music
the
term
classical
music
was
not
used
until
the
early
century


people
then
started
talking
about
classical
music
in
order
to
praise
the
great
composers
such
as
bach
mozart
and
beethoven


in
the
century
many
different
ways
of
composing
were
used
including
music
played
by
electronic
instruments
or
very
modern
music
using
strange
sounds
experimental
or
avant
garde
music
for
example
the
music
of
john
cage


some
people
feel
that
this
kind
of
music
can
not
really
be
described
as
classical
music

<collocation>new york</collocation>

classical
music
can
be
for
instruments
or
for
the
voice


the
<collocation>symphony orchestra</collocation>
is
the
most
common
group
of
instruments
for
the
playing
of
classical
music


it
has
four
families
of
instruments
the
string
instruments
which
include
the
violins
violas
and
piano
the
woodwind
instruments
which
include
flutes
oboes
clarinets
and
bassoons
together
with
related
instruments
of
different
sizes
the
brass
instruments
trumpet
trombone
tuba
and
french
horn
and
<collocation>percussion instruments</collocation>
which
nearly
always
includes
timpani
as
well
as
many
other
possible
instruments
which
are
hit
or
shaken


this
is
very
different
from
a
typical
rock
band
which
has
a
drummer
a
guitarist
one
or
two
singers
and
an
electric
bass
and
keyboard


instruments
that
play
classical
music
are
not
normally
amplified
electronically


the
same
applies
to
the
voice


singers
may
be
sopranos
altos
tenors
or
basses
depending
on
their
<collocation>vocal range</collocation>


their
voices
are
not
amplified


opera
singers
in
particular
have
to
develop
very
powerful
voices
which
will
be
heard
over
the
orchestra
and
project
right
to
the
back
of
an
opera
house


the
instruments
used
in
classical
music
developed
at
different
times


some
of
the
earliest
were
known
in
medieval
music


the
trombone
and
the
triangle
have
hardly
changed
for
hundreds
of
years
but
the
violin
family
developed
from
folk
instruments
such
as
fiddles
and
gradually
replaced
the
to
form
the
basis
of
the
modern
orchestra


this
was
happening
by
the
beginning
of
the
century
which
was
the
time
when
opera
was
invented


in
general
musical
instruments
have
become
louder
as
concert
halls
have
become
bigger


violins
are
louder
than


modern
violins
are
louder
than
the
early
century
violins
largely
because
of
they
have
metal
strings
instead
of
<collocation>gut strings</collocation>


the
piano
developed
from
the
clavichord
which
was
very
quiet
indeed


woodwind
instruments
developed
from
renaissance
instruments
while
the
clarinet
was
invented
in
the
middle
of
the
century
and
the
saxophone
and
tuba
came
even
later


modern
trumpets
sound
much
brighter
than
the
straight
trumpets
of
the
century


form

perform


they
study
such
things
as
harmony

counterpoint
to
help
them
understand
the
way
that
the
composers
were
thinking

they
put
the
