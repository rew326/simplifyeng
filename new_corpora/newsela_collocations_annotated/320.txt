electricity
is
mostly
generated
in
places
called
power
stations


power
stations
use
heat
to
turn
water
into
steam


the
force
of
the
steam
pressure
turns
giant
structures
called
turbines
which
are
linked
to
machines
called
generators


generator
have
a
head
with
wires
which
spins
inside
a
magnetic
field


<collocation>electromagnetic induction</collocation>
causes
electricity
to
flow
through
the
wires


there
are
many
sources
of
heat
which
can
be
used
to
generate
electricity


heat
sources
can
be
classified
into
two
types
renewable
energy
resources
in
which
the
supply
of
heat
energy
never
runs
out
and
energy
resources
in
which
the
supply
will
be
eventually
used
up


sometimes
a
natural
flow
such
as
wind
power
or
water
power
can
be
used
to
directly
turn
a
generator
so
no
heat
is
needed

sources
these

have
no
moving

they
are

than

and
are

are

an
anesthetic
is
a
substance
that
doctors
use
on
people


it
makes
them
either
stop
hurting
or
go
completely
to
sleep
during
surgery


anesthetic
can
be
rubbed
onto
the
skin
given
by
injection
shot
or
given
as
a
gas
to
breathe


the
use
of
an
anesthetic
is
called
anaesthesia


anaesthesia
blocks
the
pain
during
operations


this
lets
patients
undergo
surgery
and
other
procedures
without
the
distress
and
pain
they
would
normally
feel


it
comes
from
greek
roots
an
without
and
perceptible
able
to
feel


the
modern
anesthetic
was
created
by
joseph
lister


before
it
people
sometimes
used
cocaine
alcohol
and
other
drugs


modern
anaesthesia
is
highly
complex
and
often
involves
a
combination
of
anaesthesia
analgesia
and
muscle
relaxation
to
enable
physicians
to
do
their
part


these
three
tasks
are
known
as
the
triad
of
anaesthesia

history
when
english
people
first
came
to
the
area
there
was
a
native
american
village
on
the
spot
called


this
name
survives
in
the
name
of
the
river


this
river
was
known
for
the
healing
properties
of
its
pure
water
and
it
is
recorded
that
the
emperor
who
lived
in
what
is
now
richmond
virginia
made
the
trip
all
the
way
to
once
for
this
reason


today
this
river
is
one
of
the
most
polluted
in
the
world


the
united
states
constitution
said
that
a
capital
city
would
be
created
in
a
district
but
did
not
say
where
it
should
be


james
madison
and
others
thought
it
should
be
far
away
from
other
states
and
cities


this
way
it
would
be
independent
and
not
controlled
by
any
state


in
a
broken
link
compromise
compromise
was
reached
and
capital
was
placed
between
virginia
and
maryland


it
was
a
square
ten
miles
km
long
on
each
side
and
split
by
the
potomac
river
which
separated
the
two
states


half
of
the
district
was
in
maryland
and
the
other
half
was
in
virginia
and
the
two
states
gave
this
land
to
the
government


in
it
was
named
washington
the
district
of
columbia
to
honor
george
washington


columbia
was
another
name
for
north
america


city
design
plan
for
washington
as
revised
by
andrew
washington
was
planned
before
it
was
built


pierre
drew
a
plan
for
the
city
that
said
where
all
the
streets
parks
and
important
buildings
would
be


unlike
most
cities
has
many
roundabouts
or
traffic
circles


the
city
was
supposed
to
have
long
and
<collocation>wide avenues</collocation>
and
many
open
spaces
for
monuments
and
parks


the
national
mall
a
large
park
that
connected
the
us
capitol
to
the
washington
monument
was
one
of
the
most
important
parts
of
plan
