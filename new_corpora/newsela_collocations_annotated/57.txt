ok
okay
is
a
word
in
the
english
language


it
is
used
to
mean
that
something
is
good
or
correct


it
can
often
be
used
instead
of
the
word
yes


it
is
also
the
abbreviation
for
the
state
of
oklahoma
in
the
united
states
of
america


it
is
not
certain
where
the
word
ok
originally
comes
from
but
some
experts
say
it
came
from
a
funny
way
of
writing
ol
all
correct


you
also
find
the
phrase
ola
kala
in
greek
which
means
something
like
everything
fine


background
the
term
appears
to
have
achieved
prominence
in
the
united
states
in
when
supporters
of
the
american
democratic
political
party
claimed
during
the
united
states
<collocation>presidential election</collocation>
that
it
stood
for
old
a
nickname
for
a
democratic
<collocation>presidential candidate</collocation>
martin
van
a
native
of
<collocation>new york</collocation>


vote
for
ok
was
snappier
than
using
his
dutch
name


in
response
<collocation>whig opponents</collocation>
attributed
ok
in
the
sense
of
to
<collocation>andrew jackson</collocation>
bad
spelling


the
publicity
surrounding
the
election
appears
to
have
been
a
critical
event
in
okay
history
widely
and
suddenly
it
across
the
united

an
oxymoron
is
a
term
for
a
figure
of
speech


it
is
made
up
of
two
or
more
words
that
seem
to
be
opposite
to
each
other
or
actually
are
opposite


for
example
the
words
<collocation>wise fool</collocation>
warm
freezer
legal
murder
all
have
two
words


in
each
one
the
one
word
looks
like
the
opposite
of
the
other
word


you
can
have
words
that
look
opposite
but
are
right


for
example
a
warm
freezer
could
be
right


a
freezer
could
be
warm
if
it
was
turned
off
or
left
open


the
word
oxymoron
is
an
oxymoron
oxy
comes
from
the
greek
word
that
means
sharp
while
moron
comes
from
the
greek
word
that
means
dull


words
that
really
are
opposite
to
each
other
would
be
words
that
just
can
not
be
put
together


for
example
a
round
square
could
not
happen
because
squares
are
not
round


oxymorons
sometimes
appear
in
jokes


sometimes
the
joke
is
just
to
say
that
a
pair
of
words
are
an
oxymoron


for
example
a
joke
that
says
that
honest
politician
is
an
oxymoron


this
means
that
politicians
are
dishonest
if
the
word
politician
is
opposite
to
honest

the

to
understand
what
an
operating
system
does
is
to
take
a
close
look
at
what
computers
were
like
before
<collocation>operating systems</collocation>
were
invented


the
earliest
electronic
computers
did
not
have
any
operating
system


if
the
user
wanted
to
change
what
the
computer
was
doing
the
user
had
to
open
the
back
panel
on
the
then
very
large
computer
and
change
how
the
wires
were
connected


changing
what
the
computer
did
was
very
time
consuming
and
required
an
expert


later
computer
scientists
decided
to
have
the
wires
stay
as
they
were
and
feed
instructions
to
the
computer
with
punch
cards
cards
with
holes
that
represented
instructions
or
<collocation>magnetic tape</collocation>


the
computer
would
store
the
instructions
in
some
kind
of
memory


this
way
of
operating
a
computer
is
called
the
von
architecture


still
computers
of
the
time
generally
only
had
enough
memory
to
remember
one
program
at
a
time


if
the
user
wanted
the
computer
to
run
a
different
program
the
user
had
to
wipe
out
the
first
program
from
memory
and
then
load
another
program
into
memory


<collocation>computer operators</collocation>
and
computer
scientists
grew
tired
of
carrying
around
large
stacks
of
punch
cards


they
also
wanted
computers
to
run
more
than
one
program
at
a
time


as
years
of
work
changed
or
replaced
computers
to
have
more
memory
<collocation>computer operators</collocation>
and
computer
scientists
decided
that
some
computers
could
hold
several
programs
in
its
memory


the
computer
user
could
then
simply
choose
which
program
the
user
wanted
to
run


running
a
computer
this
way
requires
a
boss
program
that
controls
all
the
other
programs
and
asks
the
user
what
program
the
user
wants
to
run


such
a
boss
program
is
called
an
operating
system


having
several
programs
in
memory
that
can
be
run
at
any
time
makes
some
new
problems


the
operating
system
itself
has
to
remember
where
the
programs
are
at
in
memory


the
operating
system
also
has
to
prevent
two
programs
from
fighting
over
which
one
gets
to
use
the

a
philosophy
is
a
way
of
thinking
about
the
world
the
universe
and
about
society


a
philosophy
is
a
group
of
ideas
worked
out
by
a
philosopher
someone
who
has
studied
ways
of
thinking
about
the
world


the
ideas
in
philosophy
are
abstract
which
means
that
they
are
things
that
can
not
be
touched


but
this
does
not
mean
that
philosophy
is
not
about
the
real
world


ethics
for
example
asks
what
we
should
do
in
our
everyday
lives
and
metaphysics
asks
about
how
the
world
works
and
of
what
it
is
made


sometimes
people
talk
about
how
they
have
a
personal
philosophy
which
means
the
way
a
person
thinks

it

science
and

philosophy
tries
to
answer
important
questions
by
coming
up
with
answers
about
real
things
and
asking
why


sometimes
philosophy
tries
to
answer
the
same
questions
as
religion
and
science


philosophers
do
not
all
give
the
same
answers
to
questions


some
people
think
there
are
no
right
answers
in
philosophy
only
better
answers
and

answers


many
types
of
philosophy
criticize

even
attack
the
beliefs
of
science

can
be
divided
into
different

based
on
the
types

questions
that

asks

is
a
list
of
questions
split
into
groups


one
possible
list
of
answers
to
these
questions
can
be
called

there
are
many
different
philosophies
because
all
of
these
questions
have
many
different
answers
according
to

people


not

ask

these

is
sometimes
split
up
into

the
philosophy
of

life
and

things
the
philosophy
of

and
the
philosophy
of

these
are

close
together

is
the
world
that
we
see
around

what
is
reality


is
there
more
to

commonly
think

a
sculpture

many
people
would
call

a

value


other
divisions
include
and
theology


is
philosophy
good
or
bad


does
philosophy
do
any
good


very
few
people
would
dispute
this


it
is
easy
to
argue
that
philosophy
is
a
good
thing
because
it
helps
people
to
think
more
clearly


philosophy
helps
people
to
understand
the
world
and
the
way
people
act
and
think


philosophers
believe
that
asking
philosophical
questions
is
useful
because
it
brings
wisdom
and
helps
people
to
learn
about
the
world
and
each
other


some
philosophers
might
even
argue
that
the
question
is
philosophy
good
or
bad


is
a
philosophical
question
itself


however
some
people
think
that
philosophy
is
harmful
as
philosophy
encourages
and
often
questions
the
beliefs
that
others
hold


for
example
philosophies
such
as
some
existentialist
views
say
that
there
is
no
meaning
to
life
or
human
existence
except
the
meaning
that
we
make
up
or
invent


people
from
some
religions
do
not
agree
with
the
beliefs
of
existentialism


it
should
be
noted
that
every
major
science
including
physics
biology
and
chemistry
are
all
disciplines
that
originally
were
considered
philosophy


as
speculation
and
analysis
about
nature
became
more
developed
these
subjects
branched
away


this
is
a
process
that
continues
even
today
psychology
only
split
in
the
past
century


in
our
own
time
subjects
such
as
consciousness
studies
decision
theory
and
<collocation>applied ethics</collocation>
have
increasingly
found
independence
from
philosophy
as
a
whole


because
of
this
philosophy
seems
useful
because
it
makes
new
kinds
of
science


what
philosophers
do
philosophers
ask
questions
about
ideas
concepts


they
try
to
find
answers
to
those
questions


some
thinkers
find
it
very
hard
to
find
those
words
that
best
describe
the
ideas
they
have


when
they
find
answers
to
some
of
these
questions
philosophers
often
have
the
same
problem
that
is
how
to
best
tell
the
answers
they
found
to
other
people


depending
on
the
meaning
of
the
words
they
use
the
answers
change


some
philosophers
are
thinkers
called
academics
who
work
for
universities
or
colleges


these
philosophers
write
books
and
articles
about
philosophy
and
teach
classes
about
philosophy
to
university
or
college
students


other
philosophers
are
just
hobby
thinkers
who
think
about
philosophy
during
their
free
time


a
small
number
of
<collocation>hobby thinkers</collocation>
have
thought
so
much
about
philosophy
that
they
are
able
to
write
articles
for
philosophy
magazines


other
people
approach
philosophy
from
another
job


for
example
monks
artists
and
scientists
may
think
about
philosophical
ideas
and
questions


most
philosophers
work
by
asking
questions
and
looking
for
good
definitions
meanings
of
words
to
help
them
understand
what
a
question
means


some
philosophers
say
the
only
thing
needed
to
answer
a
question
is
to
find
out
what
it
means
and
that
the
only
thing
that
makes
philosophical
questions
such
as
those
above
difficult
is
that
people
do
not
really
know
what
they
mean
for
example
ludwig


philosophers
will
also
often
use
both
real
and
imaginary
examples
to
make
a
point


for
example
they
may
write
about
a
real
or
fictional
person
in
order
to
show
what
they
think
a
good
person
or
a
bad
person
is
like


some
philosophers
look
for
the
simplest
way
to
answer
a
question
and
say
that
is
probably
the
