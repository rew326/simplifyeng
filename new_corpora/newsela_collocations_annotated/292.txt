a
few
days
before

an
autograph
book
with

a
small
lock
on
the
front
but
anne
decided
to
use
it
as
a
diary


she
began
writing
in
it
almost
immediately


most
of
her
first
writings
are
about
normal
parts
of
her
life
but
she
also
wrote
about
some
other
things

otto
frank
was
scared
that
the

would
find
him
and
his
family


he
wanted
to
protect
his
family


he
spoke
to
some
of
the
people
who
worked
in

business


one
of
them
was
a
young
woman
of
about
years
old
and
was
named
gies


otto
frank
needed
help
he
was
going
to
turn
the
top
floor
of
his
business
into
a
secret
hiding
place
for
himself
and
his
family
called
the
<collocation>secret annex</collocation>


and
the
others
would
have
to
help
them
keep
their
secret
and
bring
them
food


they
hid
in
their
secret
hiding
place
for
two
whole
years
without
being
discovered
by
the
nazis


anne
frank
left
all
her
other
belongings
in
frankfurt


agreed
to
help


in
the
frank
family
together
with
the
van
and
their

they
had
prepared


they
planned
to
stay
there
until

would
end
soon
but
it
did
not


they
spent
around
two
and
a
half
years
in
their
hiding
place
never
able
to
go
out
into
the
sunshine


during
the
day
they
had
to
be
very
quiet
because
the
business
continued
downstairs
and
not
all
the
workers
knew
that
the
frank
family
was
in
hiding
in
the
upper
part

only
a
young
girl
but
she
knew
how
to
write
beautifully

wrote
about
all
the
things

young
girls
think
about
how
she
was
getting
along
with
her
friends
and
parents
boys
pretty
much
peter
her
life
and
emotions


after
a
while
anne
had
a
strong
ambition
to
be
a
writer


she
hoped
to
write
a
book
that
everyone
would
read


after
years
a
thief
had
come
and
took
not
much
but
after
about
two
and
a
half
years
in
hiding
not
long
before
the
end
of
the
war
the
thief
was
caught
and
in
exchange
of
not
going
to
jail
or
death
he
told
the
nazis
that
a
jewish
family
the
franks
were
in
hiding


nazi
soldiers
came
into
the
frank
secret
hiding
place


they
sent
the

and
the
others
to
a

put
it
into

safe
until

hoped
that

not
to
be
