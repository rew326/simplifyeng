if
it
is
seen
in
a
three
dimensional
space
the
manifold
will
look
like
this
picture


a
space
is
a
mathematical
construction
used
by
physicists
to
describe
parts
of
nature
that
are
too
small
to
see
with
the
human
eye


most
people
know
that
there
are
three
space
directions
and
one
time
direction
in
the
universe
these
directions
are
called
dimensions


physicists
use
spaces
in
studying
high
energy
physics
of
which
string
theory
is
a
part
to
add
or
or
other
numbers
to
build
up
more
dimensions
to
the
universe


the
study
of
spaces
is
part
of
a
mathematical
theory
known
as
manifold
theory


what
we
know
by
observation
of
very
small
distances
where
takes
place
is
pieced
together
by
physicists


we
believe
that
matter
is
composed
of
atoms
and
the
distances
of
the
pieces
of
the
atoms
exist
at
meters


that
is
meters


these
tiny
parts
are
also
interesting


although
they
are
small
they
are
also
very
high
in
energy


it
is
like
they
are
compressed
like
a
spring
or
like
a
very
long
rubber
band
wrapped
around
a
golf
ball


now
it
might
seem
logical
to
think
that
that
the
smaller
we
go
the
less
tight
that
is
less
energy


but
physicists
find
that
the
smaller
we
go
the
more
energy
the
tiny
particles
contain


they
believe
that
is
the
size
where
these
small
but
high
energies
begin
to
wrap
themselves
together
much
like
the
rubber
band
around
the
golf
ball
we
talked
about


an
experiment
is
going
on
in
geneva
switzerland
by
a
group
called
cern


one
of
cern
experiments
will
move
groups
of
these
particles
extremely
fast
and
let
them
smash
together


then
they
will
watch
the
pieces
of
them
as
they
fly
apart


when
we
collect
pictures
of
the
smash
we
study
them
to
see
what
happened


this
process
takes
place
in
the
world
largest
atom
smasher
or
as
it
is
referred
to
today
a
and
this
one
is
called
the


the
experiments
are
exciting
because
physicists
hope
to
find
something
never
produced
in
experiments
before
called
the
particle
and
some
people
think
that
little
black
holes
may
be
made
inside
the


but
it
is
also
believed
we
stand
a
chance
at
finding
pieces
of
atoms
and
pieces
called
particles
unwrapping
into
manifolds
or
perhaps
they
will
take
other
forms


imagine
if
the
golf
ball
were
unwound
really
fast


the
long
rubber
band
would
wobble
and
spin
as
it
unraveled


this
is
exactly
what
it
looks
like
when
we
look
at
the
atomic
particles
in
our
collectors


now
this
distance
of
meters
or
of
a
meter
is
in
wide
consideration
in
physics


for
example
the
legendary
physicist
john
wheeler
can
be
seen
working
on
maths
with
this
distance
where
takes
place
here


for
the
scales
are
tremendous
and
could
be
said
to
almost
defy
human
perception


how
small
this
is
can
be
presented
in
this
example


if
we
take
a
person
to
be
on
the
average
and
a
half
to
and
a
half
meters
tall
we
consider
the
distances
to
be
about
million
million
million
times
smaller
than
a
human


and
for
the
hyper
example
where
the
universe
as
we
know
it
completely
breaks
up
into
pure
quantum
centimetres
or
metres
in
scientific
notation
we
need
to
go
another
orders
of
magnitude
smaller


what
is
this
number


it
is
another
twenty
decimal
places
even
smaller
than
the
<collocation>distance thresholds</collocation>
is
theorized
as
beginning
to
occur
at
perhaps
of
a
meter
as
discussed
above


and
quantum
takes
place
completely
at
meters
distance
beyond
the
atomic
and
scales
of
meters


that
is
small


now
let
us
consider
what
space
may
look
like
at
these
distances


the
model
we
learn
at
school
for
the
most
part
is
that
it
is
all
straight
and
dimensional


what
we
have
studied
about
molecules
for
example
fits
extremely
well


yet
the
data
we
often
get
in
high
energy
experiments
in
seem
to
suggest
that
under
the
presence
of
high
energies
space
and
time
are
bent
around
each
other


now
in
order
to
get
a
better
handle
on
manifolds
of
which
are
an
important
set
to
high
energy
physics
let
us
begin
with
a
strip


here
is
a
formal
presentation
of
the
strip
as
well
as
a
very
practical
one
here
which
is
fun
to
do
in
classes
introducing
maths
and
physics


a
strip
has
a
half
a
dimension


consider
the
paradox
in
our
space
dimensions
with
one
time
dimension


space
as
we
recognize
it
here
in
our
everyday
life
has
three
dimensions
time
has
one
dimension
but
there
are
no
half
dimensions


but
what
happens
if
strip
is
cut
right
down
the
middle
with
a
pair
of
scissors


the
strip
will
form
into
one
piece


here
in
the
world
of
half
dimensions
or
boundaries
we
find
that
when
we
cut
something
apparently
in
half
we
come
up
with
one


this
set
of
<collocation>paradoxical behavior</collocation>
was
not
unobserved
by
the
great
dutch
artist
of
the
century
who
portrayed
in
mastery
and
detail
the
shape
of
surfaces
with
the
dimensions
or
boundaries
cut
missing
overlapping
and
so
forth
in
the
most
interesting
unexpected
and
entertaining
ways


now
when
we
consider
great
energies
and
small
distances
it
is
not
difficult
to
imagine
how
we
find
that
things
really
curve
up
onto
each
other


himself
imagined
this
perhaps
in
the
picture


do
we
find
curvatures
such
as
this
in
nature


for
example
we
notice
that
a
magnetic
field
looks
like
so
many
circles
when
we
place
iron
shavings
on
a
piece
of
paper
around
a
magnet


and
as
if
that
were
not
enough
we
notice
the
same
effect
with
respect
to
electricity


and
we
also
note
that
planets
and
planetary
objects
such
as
the
moon
rotate
about
each
other


of
course
this
is
called
the
effect
or
force
of
gravity


so
we
could
say
that
the
distance
of
meters
that
is
meters
is
extremely
important
because
it
is
the
distance
where
the
forces
of
nature
in
our
classical
or
everyday
world
become
less
effective


this
is
the
area
or
distance


at
the
same
time
more
of
the
world
at
the
small
level
perhaps
the
level
of
say
dust
becomes
much
more
important


the
number
of
dimensions
at
is
a
subject
of
great
interest
to
high
energy
physics


it
could
be
called
the
nexus
of
high
energy
physics
and
classical
physics


for
example
at
the
cutting
edge
of
the
work
where
complex
mathematics
such
as
and
emerge
one
can
read
the
papers
of
<collocation>theoretical physicists</collocation>

<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
qm
is
the

that

us
how
the
things
that

qm
also
tells
us
how
electromagnetic

like
light
work


qm
is
a
<collocation>mathematical framework</collocation>
rules
written
in
math
for
much
of
modern

and
chemistry


<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
helps
us
make
sense
of
the
smallest
things
in
nature
like
protons
neutrons
and
electrons


complex
mathematics
is
used
to
study
<collocation>subatomic particles</collocation>
and
electromagnetic
waves
because
they
act
in
very
strange
ways


<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
is
important
to
physics
and
chemistry


the
wavelength
of
a
wave
of
light
quantum
is
a
latin
word
that
means
how
much


so
a
quantum
of
energy
is
a
specific
amount
of
energy


light
sources
such
as
candles
or
<collocation>lasers shoot</collocation>
out
or
emit
light
in
bits
called
photons


photons
are
like
packets


each
one
has
a
certain
<collocation>little bit</collocation>
of
energy


photons
are
particles
much
smaller
than
atoms


the
more
photons
a
lamp
shoots
off
the
brighter
the
light


light
is
a
form
of
energy
that
behaves
like
the
waves
in
water
or
radio
waves


the
distance
between
the
top
of
one
wave
and
the
top
of
the
<collocation>next wave</collocation>
is
called
a
wavelength


each
photon
carries
a
certain
amount
or
quantum
of
energy
depending
on
its
wavelength


black
at
left
is
ultraviolet
high
frequency
black
at
right
is
infrared
low
frequency


a
light
color
depends
on
its
wavelength


the
color
violet
the
bottom
or
innermost
color
of
the
rainbow
has
a
wavelength
of
about
nm
which
is
centimeter
or
inch


photons
with
wavelengths
of
nm
are
called
ultraviolet
or
light


such
light
can
not
be
seen
by
the
human
eye


on
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
red
light
is
about
nm


infrared
light
is
about
nm
to
nm


human
eyes
are
not
sensitive
to
infrared
light
either


wavelengths
are
not
always
so
small


radio
waves
have
longer
wavelengths


the
wavelengths
for
your
fm
radio
can
be
several
meters
in
length
for
example
stations
transmitting
on
fm
are
emitting
radio
energy
with
a
wavelength
of
about
meters
which
is
about
feet


each
photon
has
a
definite
amount
of
energy
related
to
its
wavelength


the
shorter
the
wavelength
of
a
photon
the
greater
its
energy


for
example
an
ultraviolet
photon
has
more
energy
than
an
infrared
photon


pictorial
description
of
<collocation>frequency wavelength</collocation>
and
frequency
the
number
of
times
the
wave
crests
per
second
are
inversely
proportional


this
means
a
longer
wavelength
will
have
a
lower
frequency
and
vice
versa


if
the
color
of
the
light
is
infrared
lower
in
frequency
than
red
light
each
photon
can
heat
up
what
it
hits


so
if
a
strong
infrared
lamp
a
heat
lamp
is
pointed
at
a
person
that
person
will
feel
warm
or
even
hot
because
of
the
energy
stored
in
the
many
photons


the
surface
of
the
infrared
lamp
may
even
get
hot
enough
to
burn
someone
who
may
touch
it
because
of
the
continuous
and
<collocation>intense exposure</collocation>
to
the
charged
photons


however
the
person
can
not
get
a
sunburn
from
the
photons
emitted
by
the
lamp
because
those
photons
do
not
have
enough
energy
to
kill
living
cells


humans
can
not
see
infrared
light
but
we
can
feel
the
radiation
in
the
form
of
heat


for
example
a
person
walking
by
a
brick
building
that
has
been
heated
by
the
sun
will
feel
heat
from
the
building
without
having
to
touch
it


on
the
left
a
plastic
thermometer
is
under
a
bright
heat
lamp


this
infrared
<collocation>radiation warms</collocation>
but
does
not
damage
the
thermometer


on
the
right
another
plastic
thermometer
gets
hit
by
a
low
intensity
ultraviolet
light


this
radiation
damages
but
does
not
warm
the
thermometer


if
the
color
of
the
light
is
ultraviolet
higher
in
frequency
than
violet
light
then
each
photon
has
a
lot
of
energy
enough
to
hurt
skin
cells
and
cause
a
sunburn


in
fact
most
forms
of
sunburn
are
not
caused
by
heat
they
are
caused
by
the
high
energy
of
the
sun
<collocation>rays damaging</collocation>
your
skin
cells


even
higher
frequencies
of
light
or
electromagnetic
radiation
can
penetrate
deeper
into
the
body
and
cause
even
more
damage


have
so
much
energy
that
they
can
go
deep
into
the
human
body
and
kill
cells


humans
can
not
see
or
feel
ultraviolet
light
or


they
may
only
know
they
have
been
under
such
high
frequency
light
when
they
get
a
radiation
burn


areas
where
it
is
important
to
kill
germs
often
use
<collocation>ultraviolet lamps</collocation>
to
destroy
bacteria
fungi


are
sometimes
used
to
kill
cancer
cells


<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
started
when
it
was
discovered
that
a
certain
frequency
means
a
certain
amount
of
energy


energy
is
proportional
to
frequency
e
f


the
higher
the
frequency
the
more
energy
a

has
and
the
more
damage
it
can
do


<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
later

to
explain
the

<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>

the
way

first
step
in
the
downfall
of
classical
physics
discovered
the
relationship
between
frequency
and
energy


nobody
before
had
ever
guessed
that
frequency
would
be
directly
proportional
to
energy
this
means
that
as
one
doubles
the
other
does
too


if
we
choose
to
use
what
are
called
natural
units
then
the
number
representing
the
frequency
of
a
photon
would
also
represent
its
energy


the
equation
would
then
be
e
f
meaning
energy
equals
frequency


but
the
way
physics
grew
there
was
no
natural
connection
between
the
units
then
used
to
measure
energy
and
the
units
commonly
used
to
<collocation>measure time</collocation>
and
therefore
frequency


so
the
formula
that
worked
out
to
make
the
numbers
all
come
out
right
was
e
h
f
or
energy
equals
h
times
frequency


this
h
is
a
number
called
constant
after
its
discoverer


<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
is
based
on
the
knowledge
that
a
photon
of
a
certain
frequency
means
a
photon
of
a
certain
amount
of
energy


besides
that
relationship
a
specific
kind
of
atom
can
only
give
off
certain
frequencies
of
radiation
so
it
can
also
only
give
off
photons
that
have
certain
amounts
of
energy

thought
that
light
was
made
of
very
small
things
that
we
would
now
call
particles
he
referred
to
them
as
corpuscles


thought
that
light
was
made
of
waves


scientists
thought
that
a
thing
can
not
be
a
particle
and
a
wave
at
the
same
time


scientists
did
experiments
to
find
out
whether
light
was
made
of
particles
or
waves


they
found
out
that
both
ideas
were
right
light
was
somehow
both
waves
and
particles


the
experiment
performed
by
thomas
young
showed
that
light
must
act
like
a
wave


the
<collocation>photoelectric effect</collocation>
discovered
by
albert
einstein
proved
that
light
had
to
act
like
particles
that
carried
specific
amounts
of
energy
and
that
the
energies
were
linked
to
their
frequencies


this
experimental
result
is
called
the
duality
in
<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>


later
physicists
found
out
that
everything
behaves
both
like
a
wave
and
like
a
particle
not
just
light


however
this
effect
is
much
smaller
in
large
objects

richard


they
did
their
work
in
the
first
half
of
the
century


beyond
visible
light
given
off
by
<collocation>glowing hydrogen</collocation>


wavelengths
in


<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
formulas
and
ideas
were
made
to
explain
the
light
that
comes
from
<collocation>glowing hydrogen</collocation>


the
<collocation>quantum theory</collocation>
of
the
atom
also
had
to
explain
why
the
electron
stays
in
its
orbit
which
other
ideas
were
not
able
to
explain


it
followed
from
the
older
ideas
that
the
electron
would
have
to
fall
in
to
the
center
of
the
atom
because
it
starts
out
being
kept
in
orbit
by
its
own
energy
but
it
would
quickly
lose
its
energy
as
it
revolves
in
its
orbit


this
is
because
electrons
and
other
charged
particles
were
known
to
emit
light
and
lose
energy
when
they
changed
speed
or
turned


<collocation>hydrogen lamps</collocation>
work
like
<collocation>neon lights</collocation>
but
<collocation>neon lights</collocation>
have
their
own
unique
group
of
colors
and
frequencies
of
light


scientists
learned
that
they
could
identify
all
elements
by
the
light
colors
they
produce


they
just
could
not
figure
out
how
the
frequencies
were
determined


then
a
swiss
mathematician
named
figured
out
an
equation
that
told
what
l
for
wave
l
would
be
lambda
b
left
n
n
right
n
where
b
is
a
number
that
determined
to
be
equal
to
nm


this
equation
only
worked
for
the
visible
light
from
a
hydrogen
lamp


but
later
the
equation
was
made
more
general
lambda
r
left
m
n
right
where
r
is
the
constant
equal
to
nm
and
n
must
be
greater
than
m


putting
in
different
numbers
for
m
and
n
it
is
easy
to
predict
frequencies
for
many
types
of
light
ultraviolet
visible
and


to
see
how
this
works
go
to
and
go
down
past
the
middle
of
the
page


use
h
for
hydrogen


in
walter
ritz
made
the
<collocation>ritz combination</collocation>
principle
that
shows
how
certain
gaps
between
frequencies
keep
repeating
themselves


this
turned
out
to
be
important
to
several
years
later


in
albert
einstein
used
idea
to
show
that
a
beam
of
light
is
made
up
of
a
stream
of
particles
called
photons


the
energy
of
each
photon
depends
on
its
frequency


einstein
idea
is
the
beginning
of
the
idea
in
<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
that
all
<collocation>subatomic particles</collocation>
like
electrons
protons
neutrons
and
others
are
both
waves
and
particles
at
the
same
time


see
picture
of
atom
with
the
electron
as
waves
at
atom


this
led
to
a
theory
about
<collocation>subatomic particles</collocation>
and
electromagnetic
waves
called
duality


this
is
where
particles
and
waves
were
neither
one
nor
the
other
but
had
certain
properties
of
both


an
electron
falls
to
lower
orbit
and
a
photon
is
created


in
had
a
new
idea


maybe
electrons
could
only
take
up
certain
orbits
around
the
nucleus
of
an
atom


the
numbers
called
m
and
n
in
the
equation
above
could
represent
orbits


an
electron
could
begin
in
some
orbit
m
and
end
up
in
some
orbit
n
or
an
electron
could
begin
in
some
orbit
n
and
end
up
in
some
orbit
m


so
if
a
photon
hits
an
electron
its
energy
will
be
absorbed
and
the
electron
will
move
to
a
higher
orbit
because
of
that
extra
energy


and
if
an
electron
falls
from
a
higher
orbit
to
a
lower
orbit
then
it
will
have
to
give
up
energy
in
the
form
of
a
photon


the
energy
of
the
photon
will
equal
the
energy
difference
between
the
two
orbits
and
the
energy
of
a
photon
makes
it
have
a
certain
frequency
and
color


everything
worked
out
very
well
that
way
but
there
was
one
big
question
left
each
of
the
colors
of
light
produced
by
<collocation>glowing hydrogen</collocation>
and
by
glowing
neon
or
any
other
element
has
a
brightness
of
its
own
and
the
brightness
differences
are
always
the
same
for
each
element


at
this
point
most
things
about
the
light
produced
by
a
hydrogen
lamp
were
known


one
big
problem
remained
how
can
we
explain
the
brightness
of
each
of
the
lines
produced
by
<collocation>glowing hydrogen</collocation>


in
arbitrary
units
took
on
the
job
of
explaining
the
brightness
or
intensity
of
each
line


he
could
not
use
any
simple
rule
like
the
one
had
come
up
with


he
had
to
use
the
very
difficult
math
of
classical
physics
that
figures
everything
out
in
terms
of
things
like
the
mass
weight
of
an
electron
the
charge
static
electric
strength
of
an
electron
and
other
tiny
quantities


classical
physics
already
had
answers
for
the
brightness
of
the
bands
of
color
that
a
hydrogen
lamp
produces
but
the
classical
theory
said
that
there
should
be
a
continuous
rainbow
and
not
four
separate
color
bands


explanation
is
there
is
some
law
that
says
what
frequencies
of
light
<collocation>glowing hydrogen</collocation>
will
produce
