making
steel
steel
has
a
long
history


people
in
india
and
sri
were
making
small
amounts
of
steel
more
than
<collocation>years ago</collocation>


it
was
very
expensive
and
was
often
used
to
make
swords
and
knives


in
the
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>
steel
could
be
made
only
in
small
amounts
since
the
processes
took
a
long
time


in
the
time
since
there
have
been
many
changes
to
the
way
steel
is
made


in
about
the
year
steel
started
to
be
made
in
england
and
the
way
it
was
made
got
better
and
cheaper
over
the
next
years


<collocation>cheap steel</collocation>
helped
start
the
industrial
revolution
in
england
and
in
europe


the
first
industrial
process
for
making
<collocation>cheap steel</collocation>
was
the
process
followed
by
process


today
the
most
common
way
of
making
steel
is
the
steelmaking


it
uses
a
large
vessel
called
converter


liquid
raw
iron
called
pig
iron
is
poured
in
and
some
scrap
metal
is
added
in
to
balance
the
heat


oxygen
is
then
blown
into
the
iron


the
oxygen
burns
off
the
extra
carbon
and
other
impurities


then
enough
carbon
is
added
to
make
the
carbon
contents
as
wanted


the
liquid
steel
is
then
poured


it
can
be
either
cast
into
molds
or
rolled
into
sheets
slabs
beams
and
other
long
products
such
as
railway
tracks


today
steel
is
made
in
huge
buildings
called
<collocation>steel mills</collocation>
and
is
most
often
made
by
machines


it
is
a
very
cheap
metal
today
and
is
used
to
make
many
things


steel
is
used
to
making
buildings
and
bridges
and
all
kinds
of
machines


almost
all
ships
and
cars
are
today
made
from
steel


when
a
steel
object
is
old
or
it
is
broken
beyond
repair
it
is
called
scrap


the
scrap
can
be
melted
down
and
into
a
new
object


steel
is
<collocation>recyclable material</collocation>
that
is
the
same
steel
can
be
used
and


iron
and
steel
chemistry
steel
is
a
metal
alloy
which
includes
iron
and
often
some
carbon


every
material
is
made
up
of
atoms
which
are
very
small
parts


some
atoms
hold
together
quite
well
which
is
what
makes
some
solid
materials
hard


something
made
of
pure
iron
is
softer
than
steel
because
the
atoms
can
slip
over
one
another


if
other
atoms
like
carbon
are
added
they
are
different
from
iron
atoms
and
stop
the
iron
atoms
from
sliding
apart
so
easily


this
makes
the
metal
stronger
and
harder


changing
the
amount
of
carbon
or
other
atoms
added
to
steel
will
change
those
things
that
are
interesting
and
useful
about
the
metal


these
are
called
the
properties
of
the
steel


some
properties
are
how
hard
it
is
how
easily
it
bends
if
it
can
be
made
<collocation>into thin</collocation>
wires
its
strength
if
it
is
magnetic
and
can
be
picked
up
using
a
magnet
if
it
will
rust
or
corrode
steel
with
more
carbon
is
harder
and
stronger
than
pure
iron
but
it
also
breaks
more
easily
brittle


types
of
steel
these
are
a
few
of
the
many
types
of
steel
carbon
steel
the
most
common
type
but
it
must
be
painted
or
covered
or
it
will
rust
<collocation>stainless steel</collocation>
which
will
usually
not
rust
much
the
stain
in

name
is
the
red
color
of
rust
galvanized
steel
which
is
steel
covered
with
zinc
to
prevent

uses
of
steel
there
are
a
huge
number
of
things
that
people
make
from
steel


it
is
one
of
the
most
common
and
useful
metals


a
lot
of
items
made
from
iron
in
the

are
now

some
of

this
was
the

for
the
<collocation>air force</collocation>
of
germany
during
the
third
reich
when
<collocation>adolf hitler</collocation>
was
in

between

and
was
also
the
name
for
the
<collocation>air force</collocation>
during
the
era
of
the
cold
war
when
germany
was
divided
into
two
east
germany
and
west
germany


this
meant
that
the
was
the
<collocation>air force</collocation>
of
west
germany
between
and


in
these
two
countries
became
one
country
again
so
the
has
been
the
<collocation>air force</collocation>
of
the
united

germany
since


means
<collocation>air force</collocation>
in
english


the
early
years
including
<collocation>world war</collocation>
i
germany
first
had
aeroplanes
in
its
army
in
four
years
before
the
start
of
<collocation>world war</collocation>
i
in


at
that
time
aeroplanes
had
no
guns


they
were
being
used
for
<collocation>reconnaissance duties</collocation>
that
is
they
would
fly
over
the
battlefield
to
see
what
the
enemy
was
doing
and
fly
back
so
that
the
pilots
could
tell
their
generals
what
they
knew


the
generals
would
then
use
that
information


before
aeroplanes
came
along
balloons
had
been
used


during
<collocation>world war</collocation>
i
germany
used
a
few
kinds
of
aeroplane
to
fight
its
war
such
as
fighters
bombers
and
<collocation>reconnaissance aeroplanes</collocation>
but
the
fighter
aeroplanes
became
very
famous
because
of
its
brave
pilots


the
most
famous
german
pilot
of
<collocation>world war</collocation>
i
was
von
also
known
as
the
red
baron


germany
also
used
airships
called
zeppelins


they
were
named
after
count
von
zeppelin
who
had
built
the
first
airships
in
but
he
had
wanted
them
to
carry
cargo
and
passengers
not
bombs


he
died
in
but
people
still
use
his
name
when
they
remember
the
german
airships
of
<collocation>world war</collocation>
in
fact
the
zeppelin
company
is
still
making
airships
today
but
these
are
much
smaller
now


after
the
war
in
november
the
allies
or
the
allied
forces
which
included
britain
and
france
won
the
war
and
germany
had
to
sign
the
treaty
of
versailles


it
was
told
that
it
could
not
have
any
military
aeroplanes
at
all
because
it
was
blamed
for
starting
the
war
in


germany
therefore
had
to
destroy
all
its
military
aeroplanes
as
a
punishment
so
until
it
had
no
<collocation>air force</collocation>
at
all


the
years
between
the
two
world
wars
for
many
years
germany
pretended
to
have
no
army
pilots
because
the
german
army
generals
did
not
like
the
idea
of
not
having
any
aeroplanes


at
first
pilots
would
pretend
to
be
training
to
become
<collocation>airline pilots</collocation>
but
this
was
not
much
use
because
they
really
needed
to
fly
fighters
and
bombers


the
treaty
of
versailles
did
not
allow
germany
to
have
them
so
germany
had
to
ask
for
help
from
russia
its
former
and
future
enemy


in
german
army
pilots
started
to
fly
russian
fighters
and
bombers
at
a
secret
training
school
near
the
russian
city
of


these
pilots
would
then
become
the
first
ones
to
fly
for
the
new
german
<collocation>air force</collocation>
the
when
hitler
said
that
it
now
existed


the
training
school
closed
in


in
<collocation>adolf hitler</collocation>
finally
told
the
world
that
germany
had
a
new
<collocation>air force</collocation>
even
if
the
treaty
of
versailles
forbade
germany
from
having
one


hitler
therefore
was
defying
the
allies
who
had
won
<collocation>world war</collocation>
i
but
they
did
not
do
anything
about
this
because
many
people
still
remembered
the
war
in


they
were
frightened
by
the
idea
of
war
and
did
not
want
another
one


the
spanish
civil
war
of
gave
the
germans
the
opportunity
to
test
its
new
aircraft
pilots
and
weapons
in
battle


hitler
sent
many
aeroplanes
and
pilots
over
to
spain
because
he
wanted
to
support
a
man
called
franco
who
wanted
to
get
rid
of
the
spanish
government


amongst
the
aeroplanes
were
fighters
called
the
bf
and
called
the
junkers


aftermath
of
the
german
the
world
now
remembers
one
mission
that
the
german
<collocation>air force</collocation>
carried
out
during
the
war


german
bombers
attacked
the
city
of
in
the
basque
region
of
northeast
spain
and
many
civilians
people
who
were
not
soldiers
died
in
the
attack


many
governments
and
people
around
the
world
were
horrified
by
the
attack


the
artist
pablo
picasso
painted
a
painting
called
that
has
become
very
famous


people
see
the
painting
as
a
symbol
of
the
horror
of
war

<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii
the
new
in
action
the
german
<collocation>air force</collocation>
was
the
strongest
in
the
world
when
<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii
broke
out
in
september


it
supported
the
army
on
the
ground
and
the
aircraft
were
very
effective
at
defeating
all
opposition
since
the
german
armed
forces
the
had
practiced
a
very
new
and
very
fast
way
to
defeat
the
armies
of
enemies


this
was
called
blitzkrieg
or
lightning
war


the
french
and
the
british
were
prepared
for
a
trench
war


it
was
impossible
to
fight
back


results
within
a
year
germany
had
conquered
poland
denmark
norway
luxembourg
belgium
and
france


britain
supported
the
countries
attacked
by
germany
but
found
herself
on
her
own
by
june
when
germany
had
conquered
most
of
western
europe


problems
as
the
war
went
on
things
began
to
go
badly
wrong
for
the


the
leadership
of
the
began
to
become
quite
bad
as
generals
were
arguing
about
what
the
<collocation>air force</collocation>
should
be
doing
and
blaming
each
other
when
the
was
unable
to
stop
the
british
from
attacking
german
aircraft
factories
and
other
industrial
targets
in
large
numbers
during
the
night
since
they
had
lost
many
planes
when
attacking
them
by
day


not
only
that
but
germany
was
suffering
a
shortage
of
materials
needed
to
build
the
aeroplanes


things
got
worse
for
the
germans
when
the
usa
joined
the
war
in
december
because
the
americans
brought
thousands
of
bombers
to
the
<collocation>united kingdom</collocation>
and
they
attacked
germany
from
there


soon
hundreds
of
american
and
british
bombers
were
attacking
germany
every
single
day
both
by
day
and
by
night


ground
fighting
germany
could
not
hope
to
win
the
war
on
the
ground


since
russia
was
so
huge
the
government
set
up
factories
hundreds
of
miles
away
from
the
fighting
in
order
to
build
aeroplanes
tanks
guns
and
other
weapons
for
the
russian
army


this
meant
that
the
russians
would
eventually
start
to
push
the
germans
back
west
especially
after
they
defeated
the
germans
in
great
battles
near
the
city
of
and
in
the
city
of
stalingrad
itself


the
germans
had
failed
to
conquer
the
city
of
leningrad
too


on
january
the
launched
a
<collocation>desperate plan</collocation>
called
operation
a
dawn
air
attack
aimed
at
multiple
allied
air
bases
in
belgium
holland


over
german
aircraft
were
rounded
up
with
many
veteran
pilots
retired
from
combat
duty
back
into
service


the
plan
cost
more
than
it
was
worth
with
over
german
planes
lost
and
pilots
killed
or
captured


as
with
the
fog
of
war
over
german
planes
were
shot
down
by
their
own
ground
fire
who
were
not
in
on
the
plan


trivia

germany
became
famous
as
the
country
which
flew
the
first
jet
aeroplanes


in
the
started
to
use
the
world
first
jet
fighter
plane
the
even
if
the
engines
sometimes
did
not
work
properly


once
again
the
shortage
of
the
materials
needed
to
build
the
plane
as
well
as
the
continuing
bombing
of
germany
meant
that
not
as
many
were
built
as
germany
would
have
liked


even
so
germany
also
built
and
flew
the
world

after
the
war
the
allies
were
quite
impressed
with
germany
technical
know
how
gleaned
all
they
could
from
the
vast
array
of
aircraft
strewn
across
germany


the
cold
war
and
afterwards
once
again
the
allies
prohibited
germany
from
having
an
<collocation>air force</collocation>


the
russians
were
in
the
eastern
half
of
germany
and
this
half
became
east
germany


the
british
french
and
americans
were
in
the
western
half
and
this
half
became
west
germany


these
became
countries
in
their
own
right
and
east
germany
became
a
russian
puppet
state


in
case
a
new
war
started
with
russia
and
east
germany
as
enemies
the
western
allies
finally
allowed
west
germany
to
join
the
north
atlantic
<collocation>treaty organisation</collocation>
nato
an
organization
of
western
countries
which
wanted
there
to
be
peace
throughout
the
world


nato
allowed
west
germany
to
have
an
<collocation>air force</collocation>
because
the
country
was
right
next
to
east
germany


the
typhoon
first
use
germany
used
military
aircraft
in
war
for
the
first
time
since
when
they
supported
british
aircraft
in
the
war
in
in
but
many
people
still
believed
that
germany
should
never
again
go
to
war
because
of
what
had
happened
in
