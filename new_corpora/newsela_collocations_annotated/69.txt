suppose
we
want
to
measure
the
water
quality
of
a
big
lake


if
we
take
samples
next
to
the
<collocation>waste drain</collocation>
we
will
get
different
results
than
if
the
samples
are
taken
in
a
far
away
hard
to
reach
spot
of
the
lake


there
are
two
kinds
of
problems
which
are
commonly
found
when
taking
samples
if
there
are
many
samples
the
samples
will
likely
be
very
close
to
what
they
are
in
the
real
population


if
there
are
very
few
samples
however
they
might
be
very
different
from
what
they
are
in
the
real
population


this
error
is
called
a
chance
error
see
errors
and
residuals
in
statistics


the
individuals
for
the
samples
need
to
be
chosen
carefully
usually
they
will
be
chosen
randomly


if
this
is
not
the
case
the
samples
might
be
very
different
from
what
they
really
are
in
the
total
population


this
is
true
even
if
a
great
number
of
samples
is
taken


this
kind
of
error
is
called
bias


errors
we
can
reduce
chance
errors
by
taking
a
larger
sample
and
we
can
avoid
some
bias
by
choosing
randomly


however
sometimes
large
<collocation>random samples</collocation>
are
hard
to
take


and
bias
can
happen
if
some
people
refuse
to
answer
our
questions
or
if
they
know
they
are
getting
a
fake
treatment


these
problems
can
be
hard
to
fix

descriptive
statistics
finding
the
middle
of
the
data
the
middle
of
the
data
is
called
an
average


the
average
tells
us
about
a
typical
individual
in
the
population


there
are
three
kinds
of
average
that
are
often
used
the
mean
the
median
and
the
mode


the
examples
below
use
this
sample
data
name
a
b
<collocation>c d</collocation>
e
f
<collocation>g h</collocation>
i
j
score
mean
the
formula
for
the
mean
is
bar
x
n
sum
i
n
n
where
are
the
data
and
n
is
the
population
size


see
<collocation>sigma notation</collocation>


this
means
that
you
add
up
all
the
values
and
then
divide
by
the
number
of
values


in
our
example
bar
x
the
problem
with
the
mean
is
that
it
does
not
tell
anything
about
how
the
values
are
distributed


values
that
are
very
large
or
very
small
change
the
mean
a
lot


in
statistics
these
extreme
values
might
be
errors
of
measurement
but
sometimes
the
population
really
does
contain
these
values


for
example
if
in
a
room
there
are
people
who
make
and
who
makes
day


the
mean
of
the
data
is
day


even
though
it
is
the
average
amount
the
mean
in
this
case
is
not
the
amount
any
single
person
makes
and
is
probably
useless


median
the
median
is
the
middle
item
of
the
data


to
find
the
median
we
sort
the
data
from
the
smallest
number
to
the
largest
number
and
then
choose
the
number
in
the
middle


if
there
is
an
even
number
of
data
there
will
not
be
a
number
right
in
the
middle
so
we
choose
the
two
middle
ones
and
calculate
their
mean


in
our
example
there
are
items
of
data
the
two
middle
ones
are
and
so
the
median
is


another
example
like
the
income
example
presented
for
the
mean
consider
a
room
with
people
who
have
incomes
of
and
the
median
is
because
is
the
average
of
the
two
middle
numbers
and


if
the
extreme
value
of
is
ignored
the
mean
is


in
this
case
the
median
is
close
to
the
value
obtained
when
the
extreme
value
is
thrown
out


the
median
solves
the
problem
of
extreme
values
as
described
in
the
definition
of
mean
above


mode
the
mode
is
the
most
<collocation>frequent item</collocation>
of
data


for
example
the
most
common
letter
in
english
is
the
letter
e


we
would
say
that
e
is
the
mode
of
the
distribution
of
the
letters


for
example
if
in
a
room
there
are
people
with
incomes
of
and
the
mode
is
because
occurs
three
times
and
all
other
values
occur
fewer
than
three
times


there
can
be
more
than
one
mode


for
example
if
in
a
room
there
are
people
with
incomes
of
and
the
modes
are
and


this
is
or
has
two
modes


is
very
common
and
often
indicates
that
the
data
is
the
combination
of
two
different
groups


for
instance
the
average
height
of
all
adults
in
the
has
a
distribution


this
is
because
males
and
females
have
separate
average
heights
of
m
ft
in
for
men
and
m
ft
in
for
women


these
peaks
are
apparent
when
both
groups
are
combined


the
mode
is
the
only
form
of
average
that
can
be
used
for
data
that
can
not
be
put
in
order


finding
the
spread
of
the
data
another
thing
we
can
say
about
a
set
of
data
is
how
spread
out
it
is


a
common
way
to
describe
the
spread
of
a
set
of
data
is
the
<collocation>standard deviation</collocation>


if
the
<collocation>standard deviation</collocation>
of
a
set
of
data
is
small
then
most
of
the
data
is
very
close
to
the
average


if
the
<collocation>standard deviation</collocation>
is
large
though
then
a
lot
of
the
data
is
very
different
from
the
average


if
the
data
follows
the
common
pattern
called
the
normal
distribution
then
it
is
very
useful
to
know
the
<collocation>standard deviation</collocation>


if
the
data
follows
this
pattern
we
would
say
the
data
is
normally
distributed
about
of
every
pieces
of
data
will
be
off
the
average
by
less
than
the
<collocation>standard deviation</collocation>


not
only
that
but
about
of
every
measurements
will
be
off
the
average
by
less
that
two
times
the
<collocation>standard deviation</collocation>
and
about
in
will
be
closer
to
the
average
than
three
standard
deviations


other
descriptive
statistics
we
also
can
use
statistics
to
find
out
that
some
percent
percentile
number
or
fraction
of
people
or
things
in
a
group
do
something
or
fit
in
a
certain
category

social
scientists

jargon
a
server
is
a
computer
that
serves
many
things
to
user
or
client
machines


usually
a
server
will
only
do
a
few
things


every
type
of
thing
a
server
does
is
called
a
service


services
are
used
by
other
computers
that
are
called
clients


the
relationship
between
the
client
and
the
server
is
called
a
relationship


for
example
has
a
web
server
which
has
a
service
for
sending
web
pages
over
the
internet


your
client
computer
talks
to
the
web
page
service
to
get
web
pages
for
you


a
server
can
also
host
internet
games
and
allow
file
sharing


in
simple
words
the
individual
computers
are
connected
to
some
powerful
computers
called
servers


these
store
files
and
information
in
the
form
of
website


these
files
can
be
accessed
by
different
users
anywhere
from
the
world
using
an
internet
connection


so
that
servers
and
clients
can
talk
to
each
other
they
need
to
be
connected
to
a
network
and
they
need
to
use
the
same
protocol


in
networks
a
protocol
is
a
set
way
for
machines
to
talk
to
other
machines


it
is
just
like
a
language


for
example
the
server
runs
the
<collocation>transfer protocol</collocation>
to
send
web
sites
to
your
computer
and
your
computer
uses
the
protocol
to
ask
for
pages


usually
servers
are
specially
made
to
be
more
powerful
and
reliable
and
they
are
much
more
expensive
than
normal
computers


sometimes
servers
can
be
clustered
which
means
that
lots
of
servers
work
together
to
do
one
service


the
server
might
slow
down
if
there
are
too
many
people
accessing
the
server
at
the
same
time
resulting
in
a
high
load


it
might
also
be
unable
to
take
the
high
load
so
it
will
automatically
shut
down


in
a
system
every
computer
is
both
a
client
and
a
server
to
each
other


this
is
commonly
put
into
file
sharing
and


however
this
can
help
in
attempts
at
piracy


many
game
servers
use
a
large
server
for
players
to
store
their
gaming
data
and
can
access
them
anytime
with
an
internet

<collocation>typical server</collocation>

states
are

some

there
are

history
early
states
the
earliest
states
were
just
groups
of
power


a
group
of
farms
working
together
or
a
group
of
factories
working
together
could
be
states
since
people
can
control
them
and
protect
them


more
organized
states
could
be
the
monarchies
such
as
early
egypt
under
the
pharaoh


following
this
were
larger
more
military
based
states
such
as
the
roman
empire


the
most
important
early
states
however
were
the
ancient
greek
states
which
had
freedom
writing
and
a
democracy


from
military
to
modern
state
when
the
state
the
roman
empire
fell
lots
of
little
states
were
made
and
each
was
also
and
controlled
by
a
king


these
states
did
not
often
work
together
and
war
raged


however
once
people
within
the
state
itself
started
fighting
what
called
a
civil
war
the
kings
had
to
make
peace
and
start
parliaments


modern
states
the
state
government
position
in
the
economy
modern
states
soon
started
in
the
late
century


the
main
states
in
europe
were
england
under
the
spain
under
the
hapsburg
france
under
the
bourbons
russia
under
catherine
the
great
and
alexander
the
second
these
states
all
tried
to
improve
their
politics
and
economy
and
became
more
and
more
like
the
states
today


they
formed
proper
boundaries
for
their
lands
and
worked
with
power
within
the
state
itself
more
such
as
the
church
or
the
nobility


they
made
armies
tax
systems
and
embassies
all
to
help
make
them
more
powerful
and
stable


different
types
of
state
types
of
state
can
be
separated
into
two
categories
democracy
and
dictatorship


however
just
because
a
group
of
states
are
all
democratic
does
not
mean
that
they
follow
the
same
rules


iran
pakistan
france
germany
and
the
united
states
of
america
are
all
states


each
of
them
sees
itself
as
a
democracy


each
of
them
however
has
a
different
idea
of
what
democracy
really
means


different
states
of
the
same
category
can
also
function
differently


for
example
two
democratic
states
may
be
quite
different
if
one
has
a
police
or
army
while
the
other
does
not


therefore
the
word
state
only
tells
us
what
type
of
government
that
state
follows
democratic
or
dictatorship
and
does
not
tell
us
about
the
country
itself


of
state
there
are
lots
of
of
state
branching
off
from
democracy
and
dictatorship


the
main
ones
are
pluralism
marxism
and


pluralism
pluralism
has
been
very
popular
in
the
united
states


it
shows
the
state
as
a
neutral
place
for
settling
arguments
between
other
states


pluralism
tells
us
that
all
people
are
not
equal
but
still
allows
each
group
of
people
to
tell
the
state
what
to
do


this
type
of
state
is
called
a


also
in
a
pluralist
state
politics
the
military
and
the
economy
are
all
united
and
work
together


this
means
that
all
power
in
the
state
is
diffused
across
the
people
who
live
there


marxism
marxism
was
popular
in
europe
in
the
and


it
was
started
by
marx
and


marxism
rejects
the
idea
that
a
state
is
there
for
all
the
people
living
in
it
and
is
definitely
not
a
neutral
place
for
settling
arguments


the
main
job
of
a
marxist
state
is
to
protect
capitalist
made
profits
and
to
help
people
make
contracts
to
keep
economy
in
the
state
fair


this
is
a
<collocation>good idea</collocation>
however
the
person
who
makes
the
money
by
using
production
or
contracts
has
power
over
the
people
who
do
not
make
as
much
money
as
him


this
means
that
the
working
class
the
people
who
work
in
factories
have
hardly
any
power
but
the
people
who
own
the
factories
have
a
lot
of
power


basically
instead
of
giving
power
to
everyone
such
as
a
would
do
only
a
small
part
of
the
people
have
power


both
marxism
and
pluralism
states
have
to
react
to
the
activities
of
groups
of
people
in
the
state
itself


states
do
not
see
themselves
as
instruments
to
be
controlled
they
are
more
just
geographical
areas


in
this
area
the
people
just
form
groups
themselves


an
state
can
be
made
up
of
both
marxist
and
pluralist
people
both
which
have
the
power
to
control
themselves
and
not
influence
the
other
parties
of
the
state


anarchism
anarchism
is
when
a
group
of
people
have
complete
freedom
and
do
not
believe
in
having
a
state
at
all


anarchists
are
a
lot
like
marxists
since
they
do
not
believe
that
all
people
are
equal
but
they
believe
opposite
to
marxists
that
a
country
can
work
without
any
organizations
in
it


law
and
order
are
not
necessary


anarchists
such
as
and
in
the
century
often
want
a
form
of
marxism
but
ignoring
some
of
their
rules


they
want
workers
to
manage
themselves
and
simply
get
paid
for
what
they
do
rather
than
getting
paid
in
wages

generally
streams
that
form
only
during
and
immediately
after
precipitation
are
termed
ephemeral
streams


streams
in
geographic
terms
are
awarded
order
designations


a
stream
of
the
first
order
is
a
stream
which
does
not
have
any
other
stream
feeding
into
it


a
stream
of
the
second
order
is
one
which
is
formed
by
the
joining
of
two
or
more
streams


a
stream
is
one
below
the
confluence
of
two
or
more
streams
a
stream
is
formed
by
the
confluence
of
at
least
two
streams
and
so
forth


typically
streams
are
said
to
have
a
particular
profile
beginning
with
steep
no
flood
plain
and
little
shifting
of
channels
eventually
evolving
into
streams
with
low
wide
flood
plains
and
extensive
meanders


the
initial
stage
is
sometimes
termed
a
young
stream
and
the
later
state
a
mature
or
old
stream


however
a
stream
may
meander
for
some
distance
before
falling
into
a
young
stream
condition


the
gradient
of
a
stream
is
a
critical
factor
in
determining
its
character
and
is
entirely
determined
by
its
base
level
of
erosion


the
base
level
of
erosion
is
the
point
at
which
the
stream
either
enters
the
ocean
a
lake
or
pond
or
enters
a
stretch
in
which
it
has
a
much
lower
gradient
and
may
be
specifically
applied
to
any
particular
stretch
of
a
stream


in
geologic
terms
the
stream
will
erode
down
through
its
bed
to
achieve
the
base
level
of
erosion
throughout
its
course


if
this
base
level
is
low
then
the
stream
will
rapidly
cut
through
underlying
strata
and
have
a
steep
gradient
and
if
the
base
level
is
relatively
high
then
the
stream
will
form
a
flood
plain
and
meanders


when
a
stream
flows
over
an
especially
resistant
stratum
and
forms
a
waterfall
or
cascade
or
the
same
results
because
for
some
reason
the
base
level
of
erosion
suddenly
drops
perhaps
as
a
result
of
a
fault
the
resulting
sudden
change
in
stream
elevation
is
called
a

<collocation>kinetic energy</collocation>
in
trying
to
eliminate
the


meanders
are
looping
changes
of
direction
of
a
stream


these
may
be
somewhat
in
form


typically
over
time
the
meanders
do
disappear
but
gradually
migrate
downstream


however
if
some
resistant
material
slows
or
stops
the
downstream
movement
of
a
meander
a
stream
may
erode
through
the
neck
between
two
legs
of
a
meander
to
become
temporarily
straighter
leaving
behind
an
body
of
water
termed
an
oxbow
lake
or
bayou


a
flood
may
also
result
in
a
meander
being
cut
through
in
this
way


the
point
of
origin
of
a
stream
is
often
called
the
headwaters
or
source


the
entire
basin
drained
by
the
stream
is
termed
the
watershed


every
watershed
is
made
up
of
smaller
while
most
are
parts
of
larger


for
instance
the
continental
divide
in
north
america
divides
the
atlantic
ocean
watershed
from
the
pacific
ocean
watershed
but
the
atlantic
ocean
watershed
may
be
first
divided
into
the
atlantic
ocean
drainage
and
the
gulf
of
mexico
drainage


this
delineation
within
the
united
states
is
termed
the
eastern
divide


the
gulf
of
mexico
watershed
may
be
divided
into
mississippi
river
basin
and
a
number
of
smaller
such
as
the
river
watershed


the
mississippi
river
watershed
includes
the
ohio
river
watershed
which
in
turn
includes
the
kentucky
river
watershed
and
so
forth


the
point
at
which
a
<collocation>stream empties</collocation>
into
an
ocean
or
other
large
body
of
relatively
level
water
is
termed
the
mouth


there
may
often
be
an
estuary
or
delta
at
the
mouth


some
streams
flow
underground
through
sediments
or
through
caves


especially
with
caves
a
stream
may
flow
aboveground
for
part
of
its
course
and
underground
for
part
of
its
course


when
a
stream
emerges
from
an
underground
course
it
is
termed
a
spring


the
study
of
streams
and
waterways
in
general
is
known
as
surface

and
is
