also
support
other

most
liberals
in

agree
that
equal
opportunity
for
all
people
is
a
good
goal
that
government
should
provide
some
level
of
education
and
healthcare
to
all
people
even
if
some
taxes
have
to
be
increased
to
achieve
this
goal
that
richer
people
should
pay
more

in

most
liberals
in

believe
that

is
at

somewhat
important

that

should
work
together
with
other
countries
and
not

australia
liberals
in
australia
have
many
different
ideas
about
government
than
liberals
in
the
united
states


most
liberals
in
australia
believe
that
government
should
not
increase
taxes
and
would
like
a
government
that
has
lower
taxes
and
less
power
over
the
economy


the
main
liberal
political
party
in
australia
is
the
liberal
party
of
australia


the
liberal
party
also
believes
that
government
should
support
traditional
values
and
morals
something
which
many
conservatives
believe
as
well

paradoxes
are
a
famous
set
of
stories
or
puzzles


they
were
created
by
of
in
the
century


philosophers
physicists
and
mathematicians
have
argued
over
how
to
answer
the
questions
raised
by
paradoxes
for
centuries


nine
paradoxes
have
been
attributed
to
him


constructed
them
to
answer
those
who
thought
the
idea
of
that
all
is
one
and
unchanging
was
absurd


three
of
paradoxes
are
the
most
famous
and
most
problematic
two
are
presented
below


although
the
specifics
of
each
paradox
differ
from
one
another
they
all
deal
with
the
tension
between
the
apparent
continuous
nature
of
space
and
time
and
the
discrete
or
<collocation>incremental nature</collocation>
of
physics

achilles
and
the
tortoise
in
the
paradox
of
achilles
and
the
tortoise
achilles
is
in
a
footrace
with
the
tortoise


achilles
allows
the
tortoise
a
head
start
of
metres
for
example


suppose
that
each
racer
starts
running
at
some
constant
speed
one
very
fast
and
one
very
slow


after
some
finite
time
achilles
will
have
run
metres
bringing
him
to
the
tortoise
starting
point


during
this
time
the
<collocation>slower tortoise</collocation>
has
run
a
much
shorter
distance
say
metres


it
will
then
take
achilles
some
further
time
to
run
that
metre
distance
by
which
time
the
tortoise
will
have
advanced
farther


it
will
then
take
still
more
time
for
achilles
to
reach
this
third
point
while
the
tortoise
again
moves
ahead


thus
whenever
achilles
reaches
somewhere
the
tortoise
has
been
he
still
has
farther
to
go


therefore
because
there
are
an
infinite
number
of
points
achilles
must
reach
where
the
tortoise
has
already
been
he
can
never
overtake
the
tortoise


the
dichotomy
paradox
suppose
someone
wishes
to
get
from
point
a
to
point
b


well
first
they
must
move
halfway


then
they
must
go
half
of
the
remaining
way


continuing
in
this
manner
there
will
always
be
some
small
distance
remaining
and
the
goal
would
never
actually
be
reached


there
will
always
be
another
number
to
add
in
a
series
such
as
so
motion
from
any
point
a
to
any
different
point
b
is
seen
as
an
impossibility


commentary
this
then
is
where
paradox
lies
both
pictures
of
reality
can
not
be
true
at
the
same
time


hence
either


there
is
something
wrong
with
the
way
we
perceive
the
continuous
nature
of
time


in
reality
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
discrete
or
incremental
amounts
of
time
distance
or
perhaps
anything
else
for
that
matter
or


there
is
a
third
picture
of
reality
that
unifies
the
two
pictures
the
mathematical
one
and
the
<collocation>common sense</collocation>
or
philosophical
one
that
we
do
not
yet
have
the
tools
to
fully
understand


proposed
<collocation>solutions few</collocation>
people
would
bet
that
the
tortoise
would
win
the
race
against
an
athlete


but
what
is
wrong
with
the
argument


as
one
begins
adding
the
terms
in
the
series
one
may
notice
that
the
sum
gets
closer
and
closer
to
and
will
never
exceed


aristotle
who
is
the
source
for
much
of
what
we
know
about
noted
that
as
the
distance
in
the
dichotomy
paradox
decreases
the
time
to
travel
each
distance
gets
exceedingly
smaller
and
smaller


before
archimedes
had
developed
a
method
to
derive
a
finite
answer
for
the
sum
of
infinitely
many
terms
that
get
progressively
smaller
such
as


modern
calculus
achieves
the
same
result
using
more
<collocation>rigorous methods</collocation>


some
mathematicians
such
as
w
carl
boyer
hold
that
paradoxes
are
simply
mathematical
problems
for
which
modern
calculus
provides
a
mathematical
solution


however
questions
remain
problematic
if
one
approaches
an
infinite
series
of
steps
one
step
at
a
time


this
is
known
as
a


calculus
does
not
actually
involve
adding
numbers
one
at
a
time


instead
it
determines
the
value
called
a
limit
that
the
addition
is
approaching

most
types
of
cancer
are
more
likely
to
affect
people

some
cancers
can
also
be
caused
by
viruses


even
if
a
person
is
exposed
to
one
of
these
possible
causes
of
cancer
it
does
not
mean
that
he
will
automatically
or
certainly
get
cancer


many
people
who
are
exposed
to
these
things
do
not
get
cancer
but
some
do


kinds
there
are
many
different
kinds
of
cancers


some
of
the
most
common
are
<collocation>breast cancer</collocation>
brain
cancer
leukemia
a
blood
cancer
<collocation>testicular cancer</collocation>
and
<collocation>lung cancer</collocation>


<collocation>breast cancer</collocation>
begins
in
the
breast


it
can
be
found
in
anybody
at
anytime
even
in
men


brain
cancer
starts
in
the
brain
with
a
brain
tumor


a
tumor
is
a
clump
of
cancer
cells
which
is
formed
by
cancer
cells
splitting
and
copying
each
other
to
form
more
cancer
cells
which
clump
together
into
a
tumor


the
tumor
grows
if
the
cancer
cells
in
the
tumor
continue
to
copy
themselves
and
add
more
cancer
cells
onto
the
tumor


<collocation>testicular cancer</collocation>
starts
in
the
testicles
and
is
most
common
in
young
men


and
<collocation>lung cancer</collocation>
start
in
the
lungs


is
usually
caused
by
exposure
to
asbestos


treatment
source
date
december
there
is
no
sure
cure
for
cancer


it
can
only
be
cured
if
all
of
the
<collocation>cancerous cells</collocation>
are
cut
out
or
killed
in
place


this
means
that
the
earlier
the
cancer
is
treated
the
better
the
chances
are
for
a
cure
because
the
cancer
cells
may
not
have
had
enough
time
to
copy
themselves
and
spread
so
much
that
the
person
can
not
be
cured


there
are
a
few
different
types
of
treatments
that
are
used
to
try
to
kill
cancer
cells


these
treatments
are
radiotherapy
or
radiation
therapy
which
uses
radiation
to
kill
cancer
cells
chemotherapy
which
uses
strong
medications
to
kill
cancer
cells
and
immunotherapy
also
called
biological
therapy


in
some
cases
at
least
a
part
of
the
tumor
can
be
taken
out
through
surgery


but
this
is
not
the
end
of
treatment


after
surgery
patients
may
need
radiotherapy
or
chemotherapy
to
keep
the
tumor
from
growing
again


one
big
problem
in
treating
cancer
is
that
most
things
that
kill
cancer
cells
also
kill
normal
healthy
cells


this
is
why
people
who
are
getting
chemotherapy
often
lose
their
hair
and
throw
up
a
lot
their
chemotherapy
kills
the
cells
in
the
hair
causing
the
hair
to
fall
out
and
the
chemotherapy
also
kills
cells
in
the
lining
of
the
stomach
causing
nausea
feeling
like
throwing
up
and
vomiting
throwing
up


another
problem
is
that
the
body
immune
system
which
is
supposed
to
protect
the
body
by
attacking
threats
and
intruders
usually
will
not
attack
cancer
cells
even
though
they
could
easily
kill
the
body


this
is
because
the
cancer
has
actually
become
a
part
of
the
body
by
invading
cells
and
tissues


so
the
immune
system
sees
the
cancer
as
part
of
the
body
it
is
trying
to
protect
not
as
a
threat
to
be
attacked


a
third
major
problem
is
that
there
are
many
different
types
of
cancer
and
each
type
has
its
own
symptoms
and
causes


even
with
the
same
type
of
cancer
different
people
may
have
different
symptoms
and
may
react
to
treatments
differently
their
cancer
also
may
grow
or
spread
at
different
speeds


treatment
has
to
be
a
good
fit
to
both
the
type
of
cancer
and
the
individual
person
who
has
the
cancer


many
many
people
in
many
countries
study
cancer
and
work
on
finding
treatments


there
has
been
some
good
progress
in
finding
treatments
and
many
cancers
are
treated
with
success


along
with
looking
for
different
medical
treatments
to
treat
cancer
some
studies
also
look
for
things
that
people
with
cancer
can
do
themselves
to
try
to
make
themselves
healthier


for
example
one
study
showed
that
if
a
person
with
lymphedema
a
swelling
of
the
arm
linked
to
<collocation>breast cancer</collocation>
<collocation>lifts weights</collocation>
he
may
be
able
to
fight
his
cancer
better
than
somebody
who
does
not
<collocation>lift weights</collocation>


history
complex
date
december
cancer
has
existed
for
many
thousands
of
years


today
many
of
the
medical
terms
used
to
describe
cancer
come
from
ancient
greek
and
latin


for
example
the
greek
word
carcinoma
is
used
to
describe
a
malignant
tumor
a
tumor
made
up
of
cancer
cells


the
greeks
also
used
the
word
which
would
be
translated
by
into
the
latin
word
cancer


the
prefix
or
beginning
of
a
word
is
still
used
in
medicine
in
words
like
carcinoma
or
carcinogenic
which
means


a
famous
greek
doctor
galen
helped
create
another
word
that
is
very
important
to
medicine
today
by
using
the
word
to
describe
all
tumors


this
is
where
the
word
oncology
the
branch
of
medicine
that
deals
with
cancer
comes
from


hippocrates
a
very
famous
ancient
doctor
who
is
often
called
the
father
of
modern
medicine
named
many
kinds
of
cancer


he
called
benign
tumors
tumors
that
are
not
made
up
of
cancer
cells


in
greek
means
swelling


he
called
malignant
tumors


this
means
crab
or
crayfish
in
greek
