some
iron
tools
the
iron
age
was
a
time
in
history
after
people
began
to
use
iron
tools


before
this
they
had
used
bronze
or
stone
tools


most
of
europe
africa
and
asia
reached
the
iron
age
by


in
europe
it
is
a
period
of
prehistory
because
iron
age
people
did
not
write
their
history
down


iron
is
easy
to
find
but
hard
to
make
tools
with


it
melts
at
a
higher
temperature
than
bronze


the
people
who
learned
how
to
make
iron
tools
were
able
to
make
many
of
them


this
meant
that
people
behaviors
changed


for
example
more
people
could
own
a
metal
plough


they
could
farm
their
fields
better
and
grow
more
crops


some
people
invented
coins
to
help
buy
and
sell
their
crops
and
their
iron
tools


and
of
course
bronze
weapons
and
armor
were
no
match
for
those
made
out
of
iron
so
many
peoples
who
did
not
have
iron
were
conquered
by
those
who
did


armour
was
rare
in
western
europe
iron
age
but
people
used
shields
and
helmets
to
keep
safe
in
battles


in
ancient
times
people
were
dependent
on
animals
and
plants
only


entertainment
is
something
that
gives
pleasure
or
distracts
a
person
from
daily
life
like
a
sport
or
game
that
excites
people
and
keeps
their
attention


some
entertainment
like
horror
movies
can
also
make
people
<collocation>feel sad</collocation>
or
scared


other
entertainment
like
comedy
shows
are
funny

coca
cola
was
first
made
in
the
by
john


the
first
sales
were
at
jacob
pharmacy
in
atlanta
georgia
on
may


they
sold
it
there
for
five
cents
a
glass
but
it
was
very
strong
tasting
because
they
did
not
mix
it
with
water


was
first
made
the
way
it
is
now
in
columbus
georgia


it
was
called
french
<collocation>wine coca</collocation>
at
first
and
was
sold
as
a
medicine
to
help
cure
colds
and
give
people
more
energy

drink
used
to
be
sold
at
soda
fountains
in
the
united
states

first
sold
in
bottles
in
atlanta
on
march
with
actual
cocaine
content


it
was
first
sold
in
cans
in


during
the
first
year
sales
were
about
only
nine
drinks
per
day


did
not
think
he
could
make
a
lot
of
money
with
the
drink
he
invented
so
he
sold
parts
of
his
business
to
different
people


just
before
he
died
in
he
sold
the
rest
of

business
to
candler


mr
candler

with
some
other
businessmen
started
the
company


how
was
named
the
drink

of
the
<collocation>coca leaves</collocation>
and
<collocation>kola fruits</collocation>
that
were
used
to
add
flavor


partner
and
bookkeeper
frank
robinson
suggested
the
name
coca
cola
because
he
thought
using
the
letter
c
twice
would
look
better
than
if
they
used
a
k
in
the
word
cola


he
then
wrote
down
the
name
to
use
as
a
logo

now
very
famous
