a

of
the
surface
of
phoebe
phoebe
is
a
moon
which
goes
around
orbits
the
planet
called
saturn


it
takes
eighteen
months
for
phoebe
to
go
all
the
way
around
saturn


it
is
half
made
out
of
rock
and
half
made
out
of
ice


the
ground
on
phoebe
is
black
which
means
that
it
is
very
dark
when
seen
from
earth


phoebe
does
not
have
any
air
and
there
is
no
water
on
its
surface


there
are
many
craters
on
phoebe


these
are
from
asteroids
and
other
things
crashing
into
it
and
leaving
round
marks
on
the
surface


phoebe
is
slightly
irregular
which
means
that
it
is
not
perfectly
round
like
a
ball


it
has
an
average
diameter
of
km


this
means
that
the

the
three
peaks
challenge
is
a
challenge
a
hard
task
or
job
which
involves
climbing
three
british
mountains
a
peak
is
the
top
of
a
mountain
in
less
than
hours


the
three
mountains
are
the

of

of
the
three
countries

m
each
year
many
people
attempt
try
to
do
the
challenge
to
raise
money
for
charity


they
do
this
by
getting
their
friends
and
family
to
sponsor
them
give
them
money


many
people
do
not
do
the
challenge
for
charity


they
do
it
simply
because
they
enjoy
walking
in
the
mountains
and
they
want
to
try
something
hard


these
people
usually
do
it
in
small
groups


some
of
them
will
do
the
walking
and
others
will
do
the
driving
and
the
cooking
for
them


some
people
have
completed
the
challenge
very
quickly


the
record
is
fifteen
hours


reasons
why
some
people
do
not
like
the
challenge
recently
the
challenge
has
become
more
popular


people
who
live
near
the
mountains
often
do
not

cars
around
in

of

of
people
attempt
the
challenge
each
year


supporters
of
the
challenge
say
that
only
a
few
people
cause
these
problems
and
most
behave
well


the
usual
route
most
attempts
are
made
in
the
summer
because
the
days
are
long
and
the
weather
is
good


in
the
winter
it
is
dark
for
most
of
the
day
and
can
be
very
cold


the
weather
up
the
mountains
can
change
very
quickly
and
some
people
die
in
blizzards
storms
of
snow
in
the
winter


most
people
who
attempt
the
challenge
use
the
same
route
because
it
is
the
easiest
way
of
doing
the
challenge
in
hours


they
start
with
ben
at
about
five


it
takes
about
three
hours
to
climb
this
mountain
so
they
reach
the
summit
the
top
at
about
eight
and
return
to
the
bottom
at
about
ten


in
the
summer
it
is
still
light
in
britain
at
this
time


if
people
start
climbing
ben
too
early
they
will
arrive
at
pike
too
early
the
next
morning
and
it
will
still
be
dark


it
is
important
to
be
quick
at
the
bottom
of
the
mountains


there
is
not
much
time
so
food
is
usually
prepared
by
others
waiting
at
the
bottom


when
the
climbers
arrive
they
usually
leave
immediately
and
eat
while
they
are
on
the
road


the
next
mountain
is
pike
in
the
lake
district
of
northern
england


the
journey
between
ben
and
pike
is
longer
than
the
journey
between
pike
and


this
is
why
it
is
done
at
night
when
it
is
too
dark
to
climb


the
journey
takes
six
or
seven
hours
and
the
walkers
usually
go
to
sleep


the
next
morning
they
arrive
at
pike
at
about
half
past
four


in
the
summer
it
is
light
by
this
time


pike
is
not
as
high
as
the
other
mountains
but
is
harder


if
it
is
climbed
quickly
enough
and
the
walkers
do
not
get
lost
they
can
return
to
the
bottom
by
about
nine


it
takes
several
hours
to
get
to
in
wales


the
walkers
are
usually
very
tired
and
worried
that
there
is
not
enough
time


if
they
arrive
at
the
bottom
of
at
half
past
one
in
the
afternoon
they
can
climb
it
in
two
hours


this
leaves
them
an
hour
and
a
half
to
get
back
to
the
bottom


if
they
were
too
slow
on
the
other
mountains
or
the
journeys
in
between
they
might
have
to
run


you
need
to
be
quite
fit
to
do
the
challenge
in
hours
but
people
who
are
young
and
active
and
people
who
are
used
to
can
do
it


compared
to
some
mountains
in
the
world
all
the
mountains
in
britain
are
small


if
the
weather
is
bad
or
the
drivers
are
slow
it
is
very
hard
