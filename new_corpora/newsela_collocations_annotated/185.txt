delegated
legislation
other
parliaments
other
parliaments
have
copied
the
and
work
similarly


they
have
three
levels
a
lower
house
which
makes
the
law
an
upper
house
which
reviews
the
law
decides
if
they
like
it
or
not
and
suggest
changes
to
it
and
a
head
of
state
who
is
mostly
for
show
and
who
starts
and
ends
each
year
of
parliament


the
<collocation>prime minister</collocation>
is
almost
always
the
person
whose
party
has
the
most
seats
but
if
the
lower
house
does
not
think
he
is
doing
a
good
job
they
can
call
a
vote
of
no
confidence
and
ask
him
to
leave
his
job
as
<collocation>prime minister</collocation>
or
have
an
election


the
word
parliament
sometimes
people
use
the
word
parliament
to
describe
a
legislature
even
if
it
is
not
a
real
parliament


a
parliament
is
a
type
of
legislature
which
has
a
<collocation>prime minister</collocation>


similar
to
a
congress
a
parliament
is
a
lot
like
a
congress
but
a
congress
can
not
ask
the
head
of
the
government
to
leave
his
job


also
a
congress
runs
for
a
number
of
years
according
to
the
country
constitution
but
a
parliament
can
be
stopped
as
long
as
enough
members
agree


elections
are
held
after
this
happens

person
a
actually
a
computer
and
person
b
both
say
that
they
are
human


person
c
tries
to
find
out
whether
person
a
or
person
b
is
the
computer
or
the
human


the
test
is
a
test
to
see
if
a
computer
can
trick
a
person
into
believing
that
the
computer
is
a
person
too


alan
thought
that
if
a
human
could
not
tell
the
difference
between
another
human
and
the
computer
then
that
computer
must
be
as
intelligent
as
a
human


<collocation>test setup</collocation>
a
person
has
a
telegraph
and
is
connected
to
two
communication
partners


one
of
the
two
correspondents
is
a
machine


the
person
can
ask
anything
with
the
telegraph


if
the
person
can
not
tell
which
of
the
two
is
the
machine
more
than
of
the
time
then
the
machine
is
said
to
be
intelligent
or
smart


later
on
people
narrowed
down
the
test


a
human
is
unlikely
to
know
everything


therefore
both
the
human
and
the
machine
would
be
specialists
in
some
field
of
knowledge


so
would
the
person
asking


as
of
no
one
has
made
a
computer
that
can
pass
the
test


however
came
close
to


a
fuel
is
a
substance
that
is
changed
in
some
way
to
produce
heat
electricity
or
other
forms
of
energy


this
is
usually
by
being
burnt
although
there
are
exceptions
such
as
nuclear
fuel


fuel
can
be
divided
into
two
main
types
<collocation>fossil fuels</collocation>
and
other
fuels


<collocation>fossil fuels</collocation>
main
<collocation>fossil fuel</collocation>
there
are
several
kinds
of
<collocation>fossil fuels</collocation>
coal
oil
and
products
that
are
refined
from
oil
gasoline
diesel
kerosene
natural
gas
some
people
do
not
want
us
to
use
<collocation>fossil fuels</collocation>
because
they
may
pollute
the
environment


because
all
<collocation>fossil fuels</collocation>
are
made
out
of
carbon
burning
them
makes
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>


some
people
think
that
too
much
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
in
the
air
may
cause
a
<collocation>greenhouse effect</collocation>


<collocation>fossil fuels</collocation>
are
also
or
renew
extremely
slowly
thousands
of
years


this
means
that
we
will
eventually
run
out
of
<collocation>fossil fuels</collocation>


other
fuels
other
fuels
are
not
made
from
fossils


some
of
these
like
nuclear
and
hydrogen
do
not
have
carbon
in
them


others
like
wood
or
ethanol
do
have
carbon
in
them


some
examples
of
these
fuels
are
nuclear
fuel
hydrogen
extracted
from
the
wind
biomass
firewood
a
fuel
made
from
plants
ethanol
made
from
corn
maize
or
other
grains
these
fuels
are
renewable


this
means
that
we
can
make
more
of
them
if
we
run
out


for
instance
if
we
run
out
of
ethanol
we
can
grow
some
more
corn
and
make
some
more
ethanol
