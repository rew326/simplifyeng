crimes

behavior

atlantic
ocean
view
from
massachusetts
the
atlantic
ocean
is
the
body
of
water
which
is
bordered
on
its
west
by
the
americas
and
part
of
the
pacific
ocean
on
its
east
by
europe
africa
and
the
<collocation>indian ocean</collocation>
to
the
north
by
the
arctic
ocean
and
to
the
south
by
the
southern
ocean


scientists
say
that
millions
of
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
there
was
only
one
ocean
and
that
most
of
the
land
in
the
world
was
joined
together
over
where
the
atlantic
ocean
is
now


eventually
they
think
an
enormous
crack
developed
in
the
ground
due
to
volcanic
forces
and
that
the
continents
started
ever
so
slowly
drifting
away
from
each
other


the
crack
would
have
filled
with
water
from
rivers
and
eventually
the
sea
might
have
broken
through
from
the
north
and
the
south


even
to
this
day
the
east
coast
of
the
americas
is
shaped
somewhat
like
the
west
coast
of
africa
but
the
difference
is
actually
much
greater
than
it
might
appear
so
it
is
not
really
an
exact
fit
or
even
a
close
one


the
atlantic
ocean
is
still
growing
now
because
of
spreading
from
the
ridge
while
the
pacific
ocean
is
said
to
be
shrinking
because
the
sea
floor
is
folding
under
itself


<collocation>gulf stream</collocation>
the
atlantic
ocean
has
important
ocean
currents


one
of
these
called
the
<collocation>gulf stream</collocation>
flows
across
the
north
atlantic


water
gets
heated
by
the
sun
in
the
caribbean
sea
and
then
moves
northwest
toward
the
north
pole


this
makes
france
ireland
britain
iceland
and
norway
in
europe
much
warmer
in
winter
than
newfoundland
and
nova
scotia
in
canada


without
the
<collocation>gulf stream</collocation>
the
climates
of
northeast
canada
and
northwest
europe
might
be
the
same
because
these
places
are
about
the
same
distance
from
the
north
pole


there
are
currents
in
the
south
atlantic
too
but
the
shape
of
this
sea
means
that
it
has
less
effect
on
south
africa


this
is
also
the
place
where
takes
place

properties
mercury
is
a
liquid
metal


the
reason
for
mercury
being
a
liquid
is
quite
complex


it
is
quite
heavy
a
chunk
of
iron
can
float
on
mercury


compared
to
other
metals
it
does
not
conduct
heat
well


however
it
conducts
electricity
fairly
well


mercury
is
the
only
metal
with
a
known
melting
point
c
lower
than


mercury
is
one
of
the
two
elements
that
are
liquids
at
room
temperature
and
normal
pressure


bromine
is
the
other
one


mercury
may
be
seen
as
a
transition
metal
but
it
is
normally
seen
as
a
metal


it
is
in
group
of
the
<collocation>periodic table</collocation>


mercury
has
seven
stable
non
radioactive
isotopes


hg
is
the
most
common
isotope


mercury
makes
a
blue
to
ultraviolet
color
in
a
tube
when
a
spark
is
passed
through
it


the
ultraviolet
light
can
kill
germs


chemical
properties
mercury
is
an
metal


it
does
not
corrode
in
air
unless
hydrogen
sulfide
is
also
there
similar
to
silver


mercury
can
to
mercury
ii
oxide
when
heated
in
air


if
it
is
heated
further
it
decomposes
into
mercury
and
oxygen
again


it
does
not
dissolve
in
ordinary
acids
but
can
dissolve
in
oxidizing
acids
to
make
mercury
salts


it
can
make
when
mixed
with
most
metals
like
aluminium
gold
and
zinc


iron
tantalum
tungsten
and
platinum
do
not
make
with
mercury


iron
flasks
were
used
to
trade
mercury
because
of
this


mercury
can
dissolve
large
amounts
of
aluminium
metal
making
it
dangerous
to
transport
in
<collocation>aluminium containers</collocation>


the
thin
layer
of
oxide
on
aluminium
stops
it
from
making
an
amalgam
with
aluminium
but
the
<collocation>oxide coating</collocation>
can
be
damaged
to
expose
the
metal


then
the
aluminium
metal
is
dissolved
and
oxidizes
to
<collocation>aluminium oxide</collocation>


the
<collocation>aluminium oxide</collocation>
forms
a
solid
and
releases
the
mercury
which
more
aluminium


this
process
keeps
repeating
until
a
large
amount
of
aluminium
is
dissolved
