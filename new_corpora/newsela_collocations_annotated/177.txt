the
model
of
the
atom


three
electron
shells
about
a
nucleus
with
an
electron
moving
from
the
second
to
the
first
level
and
releasing
a
photon


electrons
have
the
smallest
electrical
charge


this
electrical
charge
equals
the
charge
of
a
proton
but
has
the
opposite
sign


for
this
reason
electrons
are
attracted
by
the
protons
of
atomic
nuclei
and
usually
form
atoms


an
electron
has
a
mass
of
about
times
a
proton


one
way
to
think
about
the
location
of
electrons
in
an
atom
is
to
imagine
that
they
orbit
at
fixed
distances
from
the
nucleus


this
way
electrons
in
an
atom
exist
in
a
number
of
electron
shells
surrounding
the
central
nucleus


each
electron
shell
is
given
a
number
and
so
on
starting
from
the
one
closest
to
the
nucleus
the
<collocation>innermost shell</collocation>


each
shell
can
hold
up
to
a
certain
maximum
number
of
electrons


the
distribution
of
electrons
in
the
various
shells
is
called
<collocation>electronic arrangement</collocation>
or
electronic
form
or
shape


<collocation>electronic arrangement</collocation>
can
be
shown
by
numbering
or
an
electron
diagram


a
different
way
to
think
about
the
location
of
electrons
is
to
use
<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
to
calculate
their
<collocation>atomic orbitals</collocation>


the
electron
is
one
of
a
class
of
<collocation>subatomic particles</collocation>
called
leptons


the
electron
has
a
negative
electric
charge


the
electron
has
another
property
called
spin


its
spin
value
is
which
makes
it
a


while
most
electrons
are
found
in
atoms
others
move
independently
in
matter
or
together
as
<collocation>cathode rays</collocation>
in
a
vacuum


in
some
superconductors
electrons
move
in
pairs


when
electrons
flow
this
flow
is
called
electricity
or
an
electric
current


an
object
can
be
described
as
negatively
charged
if
there
are
more
electrons
than
protons
in
an
object
or
positively
charged
when
there
are
more
protons
than
electrons


electrons
can
move
from
one
object
to
another
when
touched


they
may
be
attracted
to
another
object
with
opposite
charge
or
repelled
when
they
both
have
the
same
charge


when
an
object
is
grounded
electrons
from
the
charged
object
go
into
the
ground
making
the
object
neutral


this
is
what
<collocation>lightning conductors</collocation>
do


chemical
reactions
electrons
in
their
shells
round
an
atom
are
the
basis
of
chemical
reactions


complete
<collocation>outer shells</collocation>
with
maximum
electrons
are
less
reactive


<collocation>outer shells</collocation>
with
less
than
maximum
electrons
are
reactive


the
number
of
electrons
in
atoms
is
the
underlying
basis
of
the
chemical
<collocation>periodic table</collocation>


measurement
electric
charge
can
be
directly
measured
with
a
device
called
an
electrometer


electric
current
can
be
directly
measured
with
a


the
measurement
given
off
by
a
is
different
from
the
measurement
given
off
by
an
electrometer


today
laboratory
instruments
are
capable
of
containing
and
observing
individual
electrons


seeing
an
electron
in
laboratory
conditions
the
interactions
of
individual
electrons
can
be
observed
by
means
of
<collocation>particle detectors</collocation>
which
allow
measurement
of
specific
properties
such
as
energy
spin
and
charge


in
one
instance
a
penning
trap
was
used
to
contain
a
single
electron
for
months


the
magnetic
moment
of
the
electron
was
measured
to
a
precision
of
eleven
digits
which
in
was
a
greater
accuracy
than
for
any
other
physical
constant


the
first
video
images
of
an
electron
energy
distribution
were
captured
by
a
team
at
university
in
sweden
february


the
scientists
used
extremely
short
flashes
of
light
called
pulses
which
allowed
an
electron
motion
to
be
observed
for
the
first
time


the
distribution
of
the
electrons
in
solid
materials
can
also
be
visualized


the
of
the
electron
is
called
a
positron


this
is
identical
to
the
electron
but
carries
electrical
and
other
charges
of
the
opposite
sign


when
an
electron
collides
with
a
positron
they
may
scatter
off
each
other
or
be
totally
annihilated
producing
a
pair
or
more
of
<collocation>gamma ray</collocation>
photons


history
of
its
discovery
the
effects
of
electrons
were
known
long
before
it
could
be
explained


the
ancient
greeks
knew
that
rubbing
amber
against
fur
attracted
small
objects


now
we
know
the
rubbing
strips
off
electrons
and
that
gives
an
electric
charge
to
the
amber


many
physicists
worked
on
the
electron


proved
it
existed
in
but
another
man
gave
it
the
name
electron

an
ambassador
is
a
person
sent
by
the
government
of
a
country
to
a
different
country


the
ambassador
is
the
official
representative
of
their
country


the
ambassador
speaks
to
officials
of
the
other
country
about
any
problems
and
issues
between
the
two
countries


in
past
years
communication
between
countries
could
take
days
or
weeks


it
was
necessary
to
have
a
person
in
each
foreign
capital
to
have
meetings
and
make
negotiations
between
countries


nowadays
communication
is
much
faster
and
often
governments
can
be
in
direct
contact
with
each
other


however
it
is
still
true
that
many
problems
need
meetings
so
ambassadors
are
still
needed


often
an
ambassador
will
live
in
the
foreign
country
for
a
number
of
years


an
embassy
is
where
the
ambassador
lives


embassies
are
most
often
in
the
capital
of
the
foreign
country


an
ambassador
may
bring
people
with
him
to
help
him
and
work
at
the
embassy


some
of
the
high
ranking
people
may
be
called
embassy
officials


it
is
both
tradition
and
law
that
the
ambassador
and
many
embassy
officials
have
diplomatic
immunity


they
can
not
be
arrested
or
prosecuted
in
the
foreign
country


the
only
possibility
is
to
send
a
person
back
to
their
own
country

a
nuclear
war
is
a
war
in
which
countries
fight
with
nuclear
weapons


a
nuclear
war
has
never
happened
but
because
nuclear
weapons
are
extremely
powerful
and
could
cause
destruction
throughout
the
world
the
possibility
of
nuclear
war
has
had
a
great
effect
on
international
politics


history
nuclear
bombs
were
first
invented
during
<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii
and
were
used
by
the
united
states
to
bring
about
the
surrender
of
japan


two
bombs
were
dropped
one
each
on
the
cities
of
hiroshima
and
nagasaki


they
are
still
the
only
nuclear
weapons
that
have
ever
been
used
in
fighting
a
war


at
that
time
only
the
united
states
had
the
technology
needed
to
make
the
bomb
but
within
a
few
years
the
soviet
union
had
developed
it
too


in
the
new
cold
war
the
united
states
and
the
soviet
union
were
enemies
and
each
had
many
nuclear
weapons
but
they
did
not
dare
to
use
them
against
each
other
either
directly
or
by
attacking
the
other
country
allies


since
either
country
could
be
completely
destroyed
by
the
other
weapons
nuclear
war
could
no
longer
be
limited
to
the
use
of
only
one
or
two
bombs
if
they
were
used
anywhere
by
one
side
the
other
would
attack
with
its
own
nuclear
weapons
and
the
fighting
would
almost
certainly
become
greater


this
situation
came
to
be
known
as
the
balance
of
terror
or
mutually
assured
destruction
and
stopped
conflicts
between
the
two
superpowers
from
leading
to
a
third
<collocation>world war</collocation>


since
the
end
of
communist
rule
in
russia
and
eastern
europe
tensions
between
america
and
russia
have
eased
and
war
has
become
less
likely


however
today
there
is
more
worry
about
<collocation>nuclear proliferation</collocation>


countries
around
the
world
who
already
have
their
own
bombs
include
britain
france
china
israel
india
pakistan
and
north
korea
as
all
kinds
of
technology
tend
to
become
cheaper
and
easier
to
get
and
use
there
is
a
fear
that
nuclear
weapons
could
become
available
to
countries
with
unstable
governments


there
is
also
the
possibility
that
terrorists
might
be
able
to
capture
or
build
nuclear
weapons
and
use
them


nuclear
war
in
popular
culture
ever
since
the
end
of
<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii
writers
and
artists
have
created
works
of
fiction
imagining
how
a
nuclear
war
might
happen
and
what
life
would
be
like
afterwards


most
have
pictured
widespread
death
and
destruction
and
a
grim
post
armageddon
world
where
a
few
<collocation>survivors struggle</collocation>
to
live
without
power
medicine
or
food


some
have
pictured
civilization
breaking
down
completely
and
primitive
societies
developing
with
the
past
world
becoming
forgotten
