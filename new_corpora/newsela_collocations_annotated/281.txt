a
logo
is
a
picture
or
drawing
that
is
used
by
a
person
group
or
company
to
mark
who
they
are


a
company
or
group
can
use
a
logo
on
the
things
that
they
make
like
on
the
things
they
sell
on
letters
and
in
advertisements


when
a
person
sees
the
logo
picture
that
person
knows
that
the
thing
they
see
the
logo
on
came
from
that
company


logos
can
have
letters
and
words
in
them


many
logos
have
the
name
of
the
company
or
group
in
them


most
logos
are
very
simple
drawings
with
only
a
small
number
of
colors


some
logos
are
only
black
and
white


in
many
countries
companies
and
groups
should
tell
their
country
government
about
the
logo
they
are
using


if
they
do
this
the
government
can
help
stop
a
different
company
or
group
from
using
the
same
logo
so
that
every
one
can
be
sure
that
the
logo
is
only
used
by
the
people
who
used
it
first


this
is
sometimes
called
a
trade
mark


logos
are
not
used
only
by
companies


many
schools
have
logos


some
cities
have
logos


clubs
can
have
logos


even
people
can
have
their
own
logos
if
they
want
the
badge
is
probably
the
oldest
form
of
logo
in
the
world


a
picture
also
called
an
image
is
a
group
of
colored
points
on
a
flat
surface
that
looks
the
same
as
something
else


for
example
a
picture
can
look
the
same
as

pictures
can
also
be

people
who
make
such

are
called

pictures
are
very
helpful


sometimes
people
say

are

building
may
be
a
noun
or
a
verb


building
is
one
of
the
most
ancient
human
skills


it
is
part
of
how
we
have
survived
and
it
is
the
<collocation>clearest symbol</collocation>
of
every
civilization


although
some
other
animals
build
simple
structures
birds
ants
and
bees
humans
have
learned
to
build
in
a
great
many
different
ways
to
suit
different
needs
and
local
conditions


we
build
mostly
for
shelter


buildings
can
shelter
people
or
animals
or
machinery
or
anything


the
simplest
building
is
just
a
roof
to
keep
the
space
beneath
dry
or
shady


adding
walls
gives
more
shelter
from
the
wind
or
rain


it
also
gives
security


by
putting
a
window
in
a
wall
with
or
without
glass
we
let
light
inside
the
building


we
leave
a
hole
somewhere
big
enough
to
go
in
and
out
with
a
door
which
can
be
opened
and
closed


often
the
door
will
have
a
lock
so
the
building
can
be
left
secure


if
a
building
is
to
last
for
a
long
time
it
must
have
a
solid
foundation


this
foundation
is
like
the
root
of
a
tree
which
is
sunk
a
bit
deep
into
the
ground
and
supports
the
walls


if
the
ground
is
soft
the
foundation
must
be
very
deep
and
strong
so
that
the
building
might
be
having
a
strong
contact
with
the
ground


if
a
building
is
high
enough
it
can
have
more
than
one
floor


people
can
climb
from
one
floor
to
the
next
by
a
staircase
or
perhaps
by
a
lift
or
elevator


this
is
known
as
going
upstairs
or
downstairs


buildings
can
also
have
a
floor
under
the
ground


this
is
usually
called
a
cellar
or
basement


small
building
in
indonesia
so
we
build
shelters
places
to
live
and
to
raise
our
young


we
also
build
places
to
work
and
to
make
things
places
to
store
things
places
to
sell
things
places
where
sick
people
can
go
to
be
treated
places
to
put
people
who
break
our
laws


we
build
to
make
life
easier
or
to
make
money


but
we
also
design
some
buildings
for
a
very
different
reason


we
build
churches
where
a
large
number
of
people
can
gather
to
worship
god
or
listen
to
what
other
people
have
to
say


until
we
began
to
build
skyscrapers
churches
were
always
the
very
largest
tallest
buildings
of
all
except
for
castles


the
biggest
churches
of
all
cathedrals
are
even
bigger
than
most
castles


big
buildings
require
much
work
to
make
thus
can
symbolise
power


they
impress
and
they
give
a
focus
to
cities


buildings
can
be
beautiful
or
ugly
exciting
or
boring


architects
are
people
trained
to
design
buildings


there
have
been
many
good
architects
and
also
many
bad
ones
just
as
there
have
been
good
builders
and
bad


architecture
can
be
an
art
form


look
at
the
building
where
you
are
reading
this


look
at
the
shapes
and
shadows


is
there
enough
light


do
some
rooms
make
you
feel
like
staying
in
them
while
others
make
you
want
to
hurry
away


do
they
have
interesting
features


think
about
how
you
could
have
made
the
building
better


almost
anybody
can
become
an
architect
if
they
want
to


but
only
a
good
architect
or
a
good
builder
can
design
or
build
a
beautiful
building

a
candle
is
a
stick
made
of
wax
with
a
string
a
thin
piece
of
rope
straight
in
the
middle


if
someone
puts
the
string
on
fire
the
flame
burns
slowly
but
for
a
long
time


fire
can
burn
most
string
very
fast


but
in
a
candle
the
string
does
not
burn
fast
because
the
fire
melts
the
wax
instead


the
wax
sometimes
drips
down
the
side
of
the
candle


when
the
melted
wax
is
far
from
the
flame
it
gets
hard
again
and
can
be
used
again
in
a
new
candle


the
flame
is
very
hot
since
it
is
a
very
small
real
fire


the
light
blue
part
of
the
flame
can
be
as
hot
as

it
can
still
burn

things


if
the
fire
spreads
it
can
grow
into
a
very
big
fire
and
even
burn
down
a
house
or
building


if
the
flame
is
kept
on
the
candle
long
enough
the
candle
will
slowly
get
shorter
and
shorter
until
it
is
gone


the
fire
on
a
candle
can
be
put
out
by
blowing
air
on
it


there
is
also
a
special
tool
called
a
candle
that
covers
the
fire
with
a
small
metal
cup
and
puts
it
out


today
candle
are
usually
only
used
in
churches
or
in
places
where
candles
are
up
very
high


stopping
the
fire
stops
the
candle
from
burning
until
it
is
all
gone


before
light
bulbs
candles
were
used
so
people
could
see
at
night


some
people
still
use
candles
today
when
electricity
is
down
or
because
they
like
the
little
amount
of
light
that
candles
make


some
people

about
different
species


salamanders
live
in
water
and
on
land
and
look
rather
like
lizards
with
four
legs
and
a
tail


they
hatch
as
larvae
from
eggs
in
the
water


at
that
stage
they
have

that
stick
out


most
salamanders
live
on
land
when
they
are
adults
after
changing
their
shape
metamorphosis


on
land
salamanders
are
confined
to
moist
habitats


their
method
of
respiration
varies


some
salamanders
stay
in

look

are

often
salamanders
may
have
a
chemical
defense
to
predators
they
are
poisonous
to
eat


in
this
case
they
will
have
warning
colouration


otherwise
if
not

they
will

differs
between
species
of

species
that
lack

through
gills


in
most
cases
these
are
<collocation>external gills</collocation>
visible
as
tufts
on
either
side
of
the
head
although
the
have
internal
gills
and
gill
slits


some
salamanders
that
are
terrestrial
have
lungs
that
are
used
in
respiration
although
these
are
simple
and
unlike
the
more
complex
organs
found
in
mammals


many
species
such
as
the
olm
have
both
lungs
and
gills
as
adults


some
terrestrial
species
lack
both
lungs
and
gills
and
perform
gas
exchange
through
their
skin
a
process
known
as
valerian
respiration
in
which
the
capillary
beds
are
spread
throughout
the
epidermis
and
inside
the
mouth


even
some
species
with
lungs
can
also
through
the
skin
in
this
manner


the
skin
of
salamanders
secretes
mucus


this
helps
to
keep
the
animal
moist
when
on
dry
land
and
maintains
their
salt
balance
while
in
water
as
well
as
providing
a
lubricant
during
swimming


salamanders
also
secrete
poison
from
glands
in
their
skin
and
some
additionally
have
skin
glands
for
secreting
courtship
pheromones


hunting
is
yet
another
unique
aspect
of
salamanders


in
the
salamanders
muscles
surrounding
the
hyoid
bone
contract
to
create
pressure
and
actually
shoot
the
hyoid
bone
out
of
the
mouth
along
with
the
tongue


the
tip
of
the
tongue
is
composed
of
a
mucus
which
creates
a
sticky
end
to
which
the
prey
is
captured


muscles
in
the
pelvic
region
are
used
in
order
to
reel
the
tongue
and
the
hyoid
back
to
its
original
position


many
of
the
highly
aquatic
species
however
have
no
muscles
in
the
tongue
and
do
not
use
it
for
capturing
prey
while
most
other
species
have
a
mobile
tongue
but
without
the
adaptations
to
the
hyoid
bone


most
species
of
salamander
have
small
teeth
in
both
the
upper
and
lower
jaws


unlike
frogs
even
the
larvae
of
salamanders
possess
these
teeth


to
find
their
prey
salamanders
use
color
vision
in
the
ultraviolet
range


permanently
subterranean
salamanders
have
reduced
eyes
which
may
even
be
covered
by
a
layer
of
skin


the
larvae
and
the
adults
of
some
highly
aquatic
species
also
have
a
<collocation>lateral line</collocation>
organ
similar
to
that
of
fish
which
can
detect
changes
in
water
pressure


salamanders
have
no
<collocation>external ear</collocation>
and
only
a
vestigial
middle
ear


salamanders
can
drop
their
tail
to
escape
predators


the
tail
will
drop
off
and
wriggle
around
for
a
little
while
and
the
salamanders
will
either
run
away
or
stay
still
enough
to
not
be
noticed
while
the
predator
is
distracted


salamanders
routinely
regenerate
complex
tissues

this
