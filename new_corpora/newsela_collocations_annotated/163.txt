sex
is
a

two

usually
of
the

species


sex
is
used
by

asexual
reproduction
an
example
is
the
binary
fission
of
an
amoeba


sometimes
jellyfish
and
many
insects
split
or
produce
eggs
without
fertilisation


these
are
all
methods
of
asexual
reproduction


<collocation>sexual reproduction</collocation>
most
plants
and
animals
reproduce
by
a
union
of
two
different
sexes


each
sex
makes
the
special
cells
used
for
reproduction


the
new
organism
is
made
when
both
types
of
cells
are
united
in
a
egg
or
zygote


organisms
that
can
make
both
kinds
of
cells
for
reproduction
are
called
hermaphrodites


for
example
most
snails
are
hermaphrodite


those
organisms
that
produce
sperm
are
called
male
those
that
produce
ova
eggs
are
called
female


some
animals
and
plants
are
capable
of
reproducing
either
sexually
or


benefits
and
drawbacks
asexual
reproduction
is
easier
than
<collocation>sexual reproduction</collocation>
but
there
are
benefits
and
drawbacks
to
both
an
offspring
produced
inherits
genes
only
from
its
parent


offspring
produced
sexually
are
genetically
somewhat
different
from
either
parent


they
inherit
genes
from
both
parents


humans
human
female
and
male
a
person
sex
is
either
male
or
female


for
example
john
sex
is
male


jane
sex
is
female


this
difference
is
sometimes
called
gender


in
humans
the
sex
of
a
person
depends
on
what
sex
chromosomes
that
person
got
from
his
or
her
parents


a
woman
ovum
egg
cell
contains
one
x
chromosome


a
man
sperm
contains
either
an
x
or
a
<collocation>y chromosome</collocation>


when
a
sperm
and
ova
combine
to
form
a
egg
the
baby
may
get
either
of
these
chromosomes
from
its
father


if
the
baby
gets
two
x
chromosomes
it
will
develop
into
a
girl


if
the
baby
gets
one
x
and
one
y
it
will
develop
into
a
boy


there
are
occasional
exceptions
to
this
rule
the
process
of
meiosis
which
makes
the
sex
cells
can
go
wrong


this
results
in
an
individual
having
x
chromosomes
or
y
chromosomes
or
instead
of


such
people
may
get
physical
or
mental
defects
which
require
treatment


examples
of
such
defects
are
<collocation>hyperactivity disorder</collocation>
obsessive
<collocation>compulsive disorder</collocation>
<collocation>mental retardation</collocation>
or
schizophrenia


these
people
may
also
have
a
weaker
immune
system
and
might
not
be
fertile


before

they
grow

this
is
not

it
also

<collocation>sex determination</collocation>
main
<collocation>sex determination</collocation>
<collocation>sex determination</collocation>
in
biology
is
about
the
function
of
sex
not
what
individuals
look
like


in
humans
males
and
females
usually
look
different


in
many
species
they
do
not
except
for
the
sex
organs


sex
can
be
determined
in
different
ways
hermaphrodites
produce
both
male
and
female
gametes


this
system
can
be
found
in
some
animals
for
example
snails
and
in
most
<collocation>flowering plants</collocation>


in
most
cases
there
are
separate
sexes


this
means
that
an
organism
either
produces
male
gametes
or
eggs
but
not
both
at
the
same
time


the
biological
cause
for
an
organism
developing
into
one
sex
or
the
other
is
called
<collocation>sex determination</collocation>


as
a
result
of
<collocation>sex determination</collocation>
the
organism
is
either
male
or
female


when
there
is
<collocation>sex determination</collocation>
there
are
basically
two
cases
the
sex
is
determined
through
the
genes
the
organism
inherits
from
its
parents


the
sex
is
determined
through
the
environment


genetic
like
humans
and
other
mammals
the
common
fruit
fly
has
an
<collocation>sex determination</collocation>
system


usually
sex
is
determined
by
an
organism
genes


with
genetic
<collocation>sex determination</collocation>
most
alleles
or
genes
that
influence
sexual
development
are
on
the
same
chromosome


that
chromosome
is
then
called
the
sex
chromosome


because
genetic
<collocation>sex determination</collocation>
is
controlled
by
a
pair
of
sex
chromosomes
or
by
the
presence
or
absence
of
one
of
the
chromosomes
there
are
usually
the
same
number
of
male
and
female
offspring


in
humans
for
instance
sperms
carry
either
an
x
or
a
<collocation>y chromosome</collocation>
and
they
occur
in
roughly
equal
numbers


are
initially
male
the
largest
fish
in
a
group
becomes
female


for
some
species
sex
is
not
determined
by
inheritance
but
instead
by
<collocation>environmental factors</collocation>
experienced
during
development
or
later
in
life


many
reptiles
have
<collocation>sex determination</collocation>
the
temperature
embryos
experience
during
their
development
determines
the
sex
of
the
organism


in
some
turtles
for
example
males
are
produced
at
lower
<collocation>incubation temperatures</collocation>
than
females
this
difference
in
critical
temperatures
can
be
as
little
as
some
fish
change
sex
over
the
course
of
their
life


this
phenomenon
is
called
sequential


in
smaller
fish
are
male
and
the
dominant
and
largest
fish
in
a
group
becomes
female


in
many
the
opposite
is
true
most
fish
are
female
at
birth
and
become
male
when
they
reach
a
certain
size


sequential
hermaphrodites
may
produce
both
types
of
gametes
over
the
course
of
their
lifetime
but
at
any
given
point
they
are
either
female
or
male


in
some
ferns
the
default
sex
is
hermaphrodite


ferns
which
grow
in
soil
which
has
previously
supported
hermaphrodites
are
influenced
by
hormones
remaining
to
develop
as
male


a

a
handle
on
one
end
and
can

tool


a
spade
is
a
particular
kind
of
shovel
made
for
digging


it
has
a
pointed
end
and
a
straight
handle


in
some
countries
such
as
australia
the
difference
between
a
spade
and
a
shovel
is
important


it
is
hard
to
move
gravel
with
a
spade
but
a
<collocation>proper shovel</collocation>
can
do
it


in
game
a
spade

hoe
or
ho
is
also
a
slang
form
of
the
word

a
hoe
is
a
tool
in
farming
and
gardening


it
has
a
blade
usually
metal
attached
to
a
long
handle
usually
wood


there
are
many
types
of
blade
and
a
variety
of
uses
probably
the
most
common
of
which
is
weeding


along
with
the
spade
and

is
considered
a

farming
implement


shovels
a
shovel
is
a
tool
used
for
digging


when
it
picks
up
the
dirt
it
makes
a
hole


they
are
usually
made
out
of
metal
at
the
bottom
and
wood
is
used
for
the
handle


household
plungers
a
plunger
is
a
tool


it
is
used
to
get
rid
of
things
that
are
blocking
pipes


the
plunger
is
placed
over
one
end
of
the
pipe
and
the
handle
is
pushed
up
and
down


doing
this
creates
a
sucking
force
which
makes
the
thing
blocking
the
pipe
move
and
unclog


old
ladder
inside
a
cave
a
ladder
is
a
tool
which
is
made
for
people
to
climb
up
or
down


ladders
have
two
vertical
supports
that
go
along
the
whole
length
of
the
ladder


between
these
supports
are
the
horizontal
rungs


the
rung
is
what
the
climber
can
put
his
foot
on


the
climber
can
use
his
hands
to
hold
on
to
the
rungs
above
him
or
to
the
supports
at
the
side


ladders
can
be
made
of
metal
wood
or
even
rope


there
are
different
types
of
ladders


some
ladders
are
made
in
one
piece


they
can
be
carried
around
and
made
to
lean
against
something
such
as
the
wall
of
a
house


there
should
be
a
good
distance
between
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
and
the
wall
so
that
the
ladder
is
not
too
vertical
otherwise
the
ladder
might
fall
backwards
and
the
climber
would
fall
off


sometimes
these
ladders
are
<collocation>extension ladders</collocation>


<collocation>extension ladders</collocation>
are
made
in
two
or
more
sections
so
that
the
ladder
can
fold
up
to
make
it
easier
to
carry
about
and
to
store

open
up
the
ladder

step
ladders
are
useful
in
the
home
or
the
garden
to
reach
things
that
are
not
too
high
ceilings
or
the
tops
of
hedges


they
have
two
parts
which
are
joined
together
by
a
hinge
so
that
they
are
shaped
like
an
upside
down
there
is
usually
a
platform
at
the
top
to
stand
on
but
this
can
be
dangerous
unless
great
care
is
taken
that
the
ladder
will
not
wobble
or
fall
down


some
ladders
are
vertical
they
go
straight
up
or
down


these
are
fixed
onto
something


examples
are
ladders
in
a
swimming
pool
for
climbing
in
and
out
of
the
water
small
ladders
to
climb
up
to
a

of
a
<collocation>canal lock</collocation>
or
of

construction
where
workmen
may
need
to
get
up
or
down
to
do

it
possible
for
the
ladder
to
be

what
genes
do
genes
are
passed
on
from
parent
to
child
and
are
an
important
part
of
what
decides
how
children
look
and
act
their
biological
properties


genes
affect
the
way
our
bodies
work
including
how
we
look


our
eye
hair
and
skin
color
are
decided
by
genes


it
is
said
that
genes
cause
genetic
effects
in
our
bodies


sometimes
a
gene
is
dominant


sometimes
it
is
recessive


for
example
let
say
a
mother
only
has
genes
for
brown
hair
and
a
father
only
has
genes
for
red
hair


the
child
will
inherit
receive
genes
for
red
hair
from
her
father
and
brown
hair
from
her
mother


the
brown
hair
gene
is
dominant
to
the
red
hair
gene


this
means
the
child
will
have
brown
hair
even
though
she
has
genes
for
both
red
and
brown
hair


this
means
only
one
dominant
gene
is
needed
for
the
child
to
receive
that
particular
trait
while
two
<collocation>recessive genes</collocation>
are
needed
for
one


a
recessive
trait
might
stay
hidden
for
many
generations


let
us
use
the
child
from
the
last
example


we
will
call
her
mary


mary
has
brown
hair
but
has
genes
for
both
red
and
brown
hair


let
us
say
mary
grew
up
and
married
tom


tom
also
has
brown
hair
but
like
mary
one
of
his
parents
had
red
hair


this
means
tom
has
genes
for
both
red
and
brown
hair


mary
and
tom
would
each
have
a
chance
of
passing
either
brown
or
red
hair
genes
to
their
children


this
means
that
the
children
of
mary
and
tom
could
have
either
red
or
brown
hair


this
explains
why
a
person
might
look
