a
welfare
state
is
where
the
government
has
a
duty
to
provide
some
level
of
basic
support
for
welfare
of
its
citizens
including
social
security


in
politics
conservatives
are
against
welfare
states


<collocation>examples schooling</collocation>
can
be
free
and
it
can
be
a
duty
of
state
to
help
ill
people


the
government
may
give
money
to
people
who
do
not
have
as
much
as
most
other
people


the
state
may
also
give
homes
to
people
who
do
not
have
them


to
make
this
happen
there
may
have
to
be
taxes
and
usually
rich
people
have
to
pay
most
taxes


the
taxes
vary
however
to
ensure
that
the
less
rich
people
can
afford
to
pay
them


for
example
in
the
poorer
people
have
to
pay
a
smaller
part
of
their
income
as
<collocation>income tax</collocation>
than
the
rich


there
are
also
taxes
put
on
things
that
people
do
not
have
to
pay
if
they
do
not
do
certain
things
such
as
buying
as
much


this
is
called
vat
value
added
tax
which
typically
deducts
so
that
there
is
no
fixed
amount
of
tax
to
pay


a
welfare
state
could
also
be
paid
for
if
the
government
borrows
money
from
people
mainly
by
selling
bonds


welfare
states
the
most
known
welfare
states
are
nordic
countries


the

canada
and

are
some
other
examples

<collocation>organic chemistry</collocation>
is
the
study
of
chemical
compounds
that
contain
carbon


carbon
has
the
ability
to
form
a
chemical
bond
with
a
wide
variety
of
chemical
elements
and
other
carbon
atoms


this
allows
a
nearly
unlimited
number
of
combinations


the
subject
of
carbon
compounds
is
called
<collocation>organic chemistry</collocation>
because
all
known
organisms
or
living
things
are
made
up
of
water
and
carbon
compounds


<collocation>organic chemistry</collocation>
largely
involves
the
synthesis
or
formation
of
organic
products
by
chemical
reaction
using
different
reactants
and
reagents
the
substances
used
up
during
a
reaction


several
different
areas
of
chemistry
expand
on
the
concepts
and
principles
of
<collocation>organic chemistry</collocation>
including
biochemistry
microbiology
and
medicine

history
the
term
organic
originates
from
jacob
a
swedish
scientist
who
used
the
term
to
refer
to
substances
present
in
living
systems


during
time
the
vital
force
theory
was
popular


this
theory
stated
that
a
life
force
was
needed
to
produce
the
organic
compounds
found
in
living
things


the
vital
force
theory
began
losing
support
after
an
experiment
conducted
by


his
work
showed
that
urea
an
organic
compound
could
be
created
from
ammonium
cyanate
an
<collocation>inorganic compound</collocation>


hydrocarbons
main
hydrocarbons
the
study
of
hydrocarbons
is
a
very
large
part
of
<collocation>organic chemistry</collocation>


hydrocarbons
are
molecules
containing
only
the
elements
carbon
and
hydrogen
in
the
form
of
chains


hydrocarbons
can
be
classified
into
two
categories
based
on
the
presence
of
a
<collocation>benzene ring</collocation>
a
circular
type
of
hydrocarbon


hydrocarbons
do
not
contain
a
<collocation>benzene ring</collocation>
and
aromatic
hydrocarbons
do


reactions
<collocation>organic chemistry</collocation>
reactions
happen
because
electrons
are
not
shared
evenly
in
a
chemical
bond


some
atoms
or
molecules
like
oxygen
nitrogen
and
negatively
charged
anions
are
because
they
have
extra
electrons
and
want
to
be
around
positive
charges


others
such
as
h
and
other
positively
charged
are
and
want
to
be
around
negative
charges


when
an
organic
molecule
has
a
positive
charge
it
is
called
a


it
is
also
an


when
and
mix
a
reaction
can
occur


common
reaction
mechanisms
a
reaction
mechanism
is
a
series
of
smaller
reactions
that
form
an
overall
reaction


two
basic
mechanism
types
are
substitution
and
<collocation>elimination reactions</collocation>


they
are
very
important
in
the
study
of
<collocation>organic chemistry</collocation>
mechanisms
because
many
more
complicated
mechanisms
use
them


substitution
reactions
n
n
substitution
occurs
when
an
atom
or
group
of
atoms
from
an
organic
molecule
and
is
replaced
by
another


if
the
leaving
and
adding
happens
at
the
same
time
it
is
called
a
n
reaction


if
the
leaving
group
breaks
away
from
the
organic
molecule
and
forms
a
before
substitution
occurs
it
is
called
an
n
reaction


<collocation>elimination reactions</collocation>
elimination
occurs
when
two
groups
are
broken
off
of
an
organic
molecule
by
a
strong
acid
and
the
resulting
charges
form
a
double
bond


usually
one
of
the
groups
is
a
and
the
other
is
a
hydrogen
atom


if
both
groups
are
pulled
off
at
the
same
time
it
is
called
an
reaction


if
one
group
is
pulled
off
first
and
forms
a
before
the
second
group
is
removed
it
is
called
an
reaction


stereochemistry
main
stereochemistry
stereochemistry
is
the
study
of
molecules
in
space


it
looks
into
the
arrangement
of
atoms
inside
of
molecules
in
space
relative
to
one
another
and
how
they
will
interact


molecules
that
have
the
same
chemical
make
up
but
are
arranged
differently
are
called


famous
chemist
louis
pasteur
was
an
early
researcher
of
stereochemistry


a
central
part
of
the
study
of
is
chirality


put
simply
<collocation>chirality looks</collocation>
at
the
symmetry
in
chemical
molecules


if
an
object
can
not
be
superimposed
onto
its
mirror
image
then
it
is
a
<collocation>chiral object</collocation>


if
it
can
it
is
called


spectroscopy
main
spectroscopy
spectroscopy
is
the
study
of
the
interactions
between
light
energy
and
matter


we
are
able
to
see
colors
because
of
energy
absorption
by
organic
and
inorganic
compounds


when
a
plant
undergoes
photosynthesis
it
traps
energy
from
the
sun
and
this
is
an
example
of
an
interaction
between
energy
and
organic
compounds


spectroscopy
is
used
to
identify
organic
molecules
in
unknown
compounds


there
are
many
types
of
spectroscopy
but
most
important
to
<collocation>organic chemistry</collocation>
are
infrared
spectroscopy
and
nuclear
magnetic
resonance
spectroscopy
