<collocation>scone varieties</collocation>
a
scone
is
a
kind
of
bread
that
is
usually
shaped
into
triangles
and
baked
on
a
griddle
or
sheet


scones
are
very
small
and
are
in
the
same
group
as
the
crumpet
or
muffin


it
is
made
of
wheat
barley
or
oatmeal
and
baking
powder
to
make
it
rise


the
scone
is
shaped
closely
like
the
north
american
biscuit
and
its
recipe
is
almost
the
same
with
it
as
well


sometimes
scones
may
have
raisins
currants
cheese
or
dates
in
them


in
the
united
states
however
scones
include
more
sweet
kind
of
fillings
like
cranberries
<collocation>chocolate chips</collocation>
or
nuts


they
can
often
be
found
in
coffee
shops
and
in
a
great
variety
in
the
british
isles


it
is
generally
thought
that
scones
are
best
eaten
when
they
are
very
hot
and
freshly
baked
right
from
the
oven
accompanied
with
melting
warm
butter


some
people
even
enjoy
buttering
their
scones
for
themselves


etymology
some
think
that
scone
comes
from
the
gaelic
which
meant
a
piece
of
dough
that
has
been
cooked
for
a
couple
of
minutes
shapeless
mass
or
large
mouthful
and
the
dutch
which
meant
fine
white
bread
or
for
last
the
german
which
meant
fine
or
beautiful
bread


the
oxford
english
dictionary
believes
the
german
and
dutch
is
more
accurate


scone
can
also
be
a
slang
word
for
head
insane
or
angry


it
is
sometimes
debated
on
the
correct
pronunciation
for
scone


in
scotland
and
north
england
the
word
is
pronounced
as
or
while
in
southern
england
it
is
pronounced
as
or


the
latter
pronunciation
came
from
the
united
states
and
canada


history
scones

connected
traditionally
with

scotland
and
ireland
but
nobody
knows
which
country
invented
it


however
the
first
known
mention
of
a
scone
that
was
printed
is
from
the
translation
of
the
written
by
a
scottish
poet
named
douglas


scones
are
related
to
the
ancient
welsh
tradition
of
cooking
small
round
<collocation>yeast cakes</collocation>
on
stones
that
later
changed
to
griddles


scones
included
oats
inside
them
and
were
baked
over
an
open
fire


however
today
scones
are
more
like
american
biscuits


they
are
made
with
wheat
and
baked
in
the
oven
