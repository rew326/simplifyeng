history
the
metric
system
was
first
introduced
in
france
in


that
system
did
not
have
its
own
unit
of
capacity
or
volume
because
volume
can
be
measured
in
cubic
metres


in
work
to
make
the
metric
system
compulsory
in
france
was
started
by
the
<collocation>temporary commission</collocation>
of
republican
weights
and
measures


due
to
public
demand
the
commission
said
that
the
cubic
metre
was
too
big
for
everyday
use


they
said
that
a
new
unit
based
on
the
old
should
be
used
instead


one
was
to
be
cubic
metres


this
was
equivalent
to
a
cube
with
sides
cm


the
was
also
known
as
the
or
the


the
had
been
an
old
french
unit
of
measure
of
capacity


in
the
definition
was
revised


the
was
given
the
name
litre


in
the
kilogram
was
defined
to
be
exactly
one
litre
of
water
a
in
the
kilogram
was
redefined


the
new
definition
said
that
the
kilogram
was
the
mass
of
the
kilogram
des

in
scientists
measured
the
volume
of
one
litre

at

very
carefully


they
found
that
it
occupied
about
gaps
dm


the
redefined
the
litre
as
being
exactly
the
volume
of
one
kilogram
of
water
at
in
the
si
was
introduced


the
changed
the
definition
of
the
litre
back
to
one
dm


the
litre
is
not
part
of
si


the
defined
the
litre
as
a
unit
accepted
for
use
with
the
si


this
was
because
it
is
used
in
many
countries


the
said
that
the
litre
should
not
be
used
very
very
accurate
work


according
to
si
rules
the
symbol
for
the
litre
should
be
l


this
is
because
the
litre
was
not
named
after
somebody
whose
name
was
litre


however
the
symbol
l
and
the
number
are
easily
confused

that

is
the
study
of

and

mathematicians
are
people
who
learn
about
and
discover
such
things
in
mathematics


mathematics
is
useful
for
solving
problems
that
occur
in
the
real
world
so
many
people
besides
mathematicians
study
and
use
mathematics


today
mathematics
is
needed
in
many
jobs


business
science
engineering
and
construction
need
some
knowledge
of
mathematics


mathematicians
solve
problems
by
using
logic


mathematicians
often
use
deduction


deduction
is
a
special
way
of
thinking
to
discover
and
prove
new
truths
using
old
truths


to
a
mathematician
the
reason
something
is
true
is
just
as
important
as
the
fact
that
it
is
true


using
deduction
is
what
makes
mathematical
thinking
different
from
other
kinds
of
thinking

paper
and

these
things
are
used
to
create
general
rules
which
are
an
important
part
of
mathematics


these
rules
leave
out
information
that
is
not
important
so
that
a
single
rule
can
cover
many
situations


by
finding
general
rules
mathematics
solves
many
problems
at
the
same
time


a
proof
gives
a
reason
why
a
rule
in
mathematics
is
correct


this
is
done
by
using
certain
other
rules
that
everyone
agrees
are
correct
which
are
called
axioms


a
rule
that
has
a
proof
is
sometimes
called
a
theorem


experts
in
mathematics
perform
research
to
create
new
theorems


sometimes
experts
find
an
idea
that
they
think
is
a
theorem
but
can
not
find
a
proof
for
it


that
idea
is
called
a
conjecture
until
they
find
a
proof


sometimes
mathematics
finds
and
studies
rules
or
ideas
in
the
real
world
that
we
do
understand
yet


often
in
mathematics
ideas
and
rules
are
chosen
because
they
are
considered
simple
or
beautiful


on
the
other
hand
sometimes
these
ideas
and
rules
are
found
in
the
real
world
after
they
are
studied
in
mathematics
this
has
happened
many
times
in
