like
other
have
skeletons

cartilage
is
tough
<collocation>rubbery material</collocation>
which
is
less
rigid
than

<collocation>cartilaginous fish</collocation>
also
include
skates
and
rays


there
are
more
than
different
kinds
of
sharks
such
as
the
great
white
and
<collocation>whale sharks</collocation>


fossils
show
that
sharks
have
been
around
for
million
years
since
the
early
silurian


most
sharks
are
predators
meaning
they
hunt
and
eat
fish
<collocation>marine mammals</collocation>
and
other
sea
creatures
but
the
largest
shark
eats
krill
like
whales


this
is
the
whale

fish
in

<collocation>characteristics sharks</collocation>
come
in
many
different
shapes
and
sizes
but
most
are
long
and
thin
also
called
streamlined
with
<collocation>powerful jaws</collocation>


their
teeth
are
constantly
replaced
throughout
their
lives


sharks
eat
so
violently
they
often
break
a
few
teeth
so
new
teeth
grow
continuously
in
a
groove
just
inside
the
mouth
and
move
forward
from
inside
the
mouth
on
conveyor
belts
formed
by
the
skin
in
which
they
are
attached
to


in
its
lifetime
a
shark
can
lose
and
regrow
as
many
as
teeth


even
with
all
those
teeth
though
sharks
can
not
chew


so
they
bite
their
prey
and
jerk
it
around
so
they
can
pull
of
a
chunk
to
swallow


the
chunks
of
food
that
a
<collocation>shark swallows</collocation>
ends
up
in
its
stomach
where
they
are
digested


this
is
pretty
slow
however
so
a
meal
might
take
several
days
to
digest


this
is
why
a
shark
does
not
eat
every
day


sharks
have
teeth
depending
on
what
they
eat


for
instance
some
sharks
have
sharp
<collocation>pointy teeth</collocation>
while
bottom
dwelling
sharks
have
cone
shaped
teeth
for
crushing
shells


because
there
are
so
many
different
kinds
of
sharks
and
because
each
kind
has
its
own
kind
of
special
teeth
many
people
enjoy
collecting
shark
teeth


shark
<collocation>teeth collectors</collocation>
can
guess
how
large
a
shark
was
by
measuring
the
<collocation>shark tooth</collocation>


first
they
measure
the
length
of
the
tooth
in
inches


every
inch
of
tooth
equals
of
shark
length
so
if
a
<collocation>shark tooth</collocation>
is
inches
long
the
tooth
came
from
a
shark
that
was
ft
long


even
more
terrifying
is
that
some
of
the
teeth
are
inches
long
so
that
a
shark
feet
long


sharks
have
skin
covered
in
millions
of
tiny
scales
that
point
to
the
tail


if
you
rub
along
a
shark
towards
the
tail
it
would
feel
smooth
but
if
you
rub
the
other
way
it
would
be
rough


sharks
teeth
can
be
times
as
big
as
human
teeth
and
they
can
grow
back
if
they
are
lost


fins
the
fins
of
sharks
are
used
for
stabilizing
steering
lift
and
swimming


each
fin
is
used
in
a
different
manner


there
are
one
or
two
fins
present
along
the
dorsal
midline
called
the
first
and
second
dorsal
fin


these
fins
help
the
shark
from
constantly
rolling
around


these
two
fins
may
or
may
not
have
spines


when
spines
are
present
they
are
used
for
<collocation>defensive purposes</collocation>
and
may
also
have
skin
glands
with
them
that
produce
an
<collocation>irritating substance</collocation>


the
pectoral
fins
are
located
behind
the
head
and
extend
outwards


these
fins
are
used
for
steering
during
swimming
and
help
to
provide
the
shark
with
lift


the
pelvic
fins
are
located
behind
the
pectoral
fins
near
the
and
are
also
stabilizers


not
all
sharks
have
<collocation>anal fins</collocation>
but
if
they
do
have
them
they
are
found
between
the
pelvic
and
fins


the
tail
region
itself
consists
of
the
and
the
fin


the
sometimes
has
notches
known
as
pits
which
are
found
just
ahead
of
the
fin


the
may
also
be
horizontally
flattened
into
lateral
keels


the
fin
has
both
an
<collocation>upper lobe</collocation>
and
a
lower
lobe
that
can
be
of
different
sizes
and
the
shape
depends
of
which
species
the
shark
is


the
primary
use
of
the
fin
is
to
provide
a
push
while
the
shark
swims


the
<collocation>upper lobe</collocation>
of
the
fin
produces
the
most
amount
of
the
push
and
usually
forces
the
<collocation>shark downwards</collocation>


the
pectoral
fins
and
the
shape
of
the
body
like
an
airfoil
work
together
to
counter
this
force


the
strong
fin
in
most
benthic
shark
species
allows
the
shark
to
swim
close
to
the
seabed
such
as
the
<collocation>nurse shark</collocation>


however
the
fastest
swimming
sharks
such
as
the
mako
sharks
tend
to
have
fins


senses
smell
the
shape
of
the
hammerhead
shark
head
may
enhance
by
spacing
the
nostrils
further
apart


sharks
have
keen
<collocation>olfactory sense</collocation>
organs
in
the
short
duct
between
the
front
and
back
nasal
openings


they
can
detect
blood
from
miles
away
as
little
as
one
part
per
million
of
blood
in
sea
water
may
be
enough


sharks
have
the
ability
to
determine
the
direction
of
a
given
scent
based
on
the
timing
of
scent
detection
in
each
nostril


this
is
similar
to
the
method
mammals
use
to
determine
direction
of
sound


they
are
more
attracted
to
the
chemicals
found
in
the
intestines
of
many
species
and
as
a
result
often
linger
near
or
in
sewage


some
species
such
as
<collocation>nurse sharks</collocation>
have
external
that
greatly
increase
their
ability
to
sense
prey


sight
shark
eyes
are
similar
to
the
eyes
of
other
vertebrates
including
similar
lenses
corneas
and
retinas


their
eyesight
is
well
adapted
to
the
marine
environment


they
can
contract
and
dilate
their
pupils
like
humans
something
no
fish
can
do


a
tissue
behind
the
retina
reflects
light
back
thereby
increasing
sight
in
darker
waters

sharks
have

all
over
the
shark
snout
especially
between
the
eye
and
the
tip
of
the
snout


in
them
are

in
the

give
off
electricity
every
time
an
animal
heart
beats
or
it
moves
tiny
currents
of
electricity
are
made


these
tiny
electric
currents
make
signals
that
travel
through
water
and
get
sensed


sharks
may
use
this
sense
when
they
catch
their
prey
even
more
than
they
use
their
sight


hearing
although
it
is
hard
to
test
sharks
hearing
they
may
have
a
sharp
sense
of
hearing
and
can
possibly
hear
prey
many
miles
away


a
small
opening
on
each
side
of
their
heads
not
the
leads

into
the
<collocation>inner ear</collocation>

channel


<collocation>lateral line</collocation>
the
<collocation>lateral line</collocation>
detects
changes
in
water
pressure


it
is
open
to
the
environment
by
a
line
of
pores


this
and
the
organs
are
grouped
together
as
the
system
because
they
have
a
common
origin


in
<collocation>bony fish</collocation>
and
tetrapods
the
external
opening
into
the
<collocation>inner ear</collocation>
has
been
lost


this
system
is
found
in
other
fish
as
well


it
detects
motion
or
vibrations
in
water


the
shark
can
sense
frequencies
in
the
range
of
to


<collocation>prehistoric sharks</collocation>
because
sharks
have
skeletons
made
of
cartilage
they
do
not
easily


that
because
cartilage
is
softer
than
bone
and
falls
apart
before


however
teeth
are
harder
and
if
that
is
not
enough
they
are
shed
throughout
a
shark
lifetime


therefore
shark
teeth
are
one
of
the
most
common
fossils


sharks
existed
for
at
least
two
hundred
million
years
before
the
dinosaurs


the
earliest
shark
fossils
were
scales
so
could
it
be
that
the
earliest
sharks
were
toothless


we
are
not
sure


early
sharks
did
not
look
like
sharks
of
today


for
example
the
<collocation>upper snout</collocation>
of
modern
sharks
is
longer
than
the
<collocation>lower jaw</collocation>


but
in
early
sharks
they
were
the
same
length


the
first
sharks
appeared
in
the
age
of
dinosaurs


sharks
back
then
were
preyed
on
by
giant
sea
reptiles


just
a
few
million
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
a
giant
shark
called
swam
in
the
seas


it
was
meters
long
twice
as
long
as
the
great
white
shark
and
it
ate
whales


died
out

<collocation>years ago</collocation>


reproduction
about
of
all
known
shark
species
give
birth
to
live
young
with
the
<collocation>gestation period</collocation>
lasting
from
to
months


pups
are
born
with
a
full
set
of
teeth
and
are
capable
of
taking
care
of
themselves


once
born
they
quickly
swim
away
from
their
mothers
who
sometimes
feed
on
the
pups


litters
vary
from
one
or
two
pups
great
white
shark
to
one

pups
blue

and
whale
shark


some
sharks
are
laying
their
eggs
in
the
water


shark
eggs
sometimes
called
mermaid
purses
are
covered
by
a
tough
leathery
membrane


the
egg
has
a
yolk
that
feeds
the
embryo
very
much
like
a
chicken
egg


most
sharks
are
meaning
the
eggs
hatch
inside
the
female
body
with
the
babies
developing
within
the
mother
but
there
is
no
placenta
to
nourish
the
pups


instead
the
young
feed
on
the
egg

the
pups
eat
any
<collocation>unfertilized eggs</collocation>
and
sometimes
each
other


very
few
pups
in
a
litter
survive
until
birth
due
to
this
form
of
sibling
cannibalism


great
white
sharks
mako
sharks
<collocation>nurse sharks</collocation>
tiger
sharks
and
<collocation>sand tiger</collocation>
sharks
reproduce
this
way


some
sharks
are
meaning
that
the
females
give
live
birth
the
eggs
hatch
inside
the
female
body
and
the
babies
are
fed
by
a
placenta


the
placenta
helps
transfer
nutrients
and
oxygen
from
the
mother
bloodstream
and
<collocation>transfers waste</collocation>
products
from
the
baby
to
the
mother
for
elimination


examples
of
sharks
include
the
bull
sharks
the
<collocation>reef sharks</collocation>
the
lemon
sharks
the
blue
sharks
the

and
the
hammerhead
sharks


although
long
thought
to
be
<collocation>whale sharks</collocation>
are
and
pregnant
females
have
been
found
containing
hundreds
of
pups


avoiding
sharks
some
good
ways
to
be
less
noticeable
to
sharks
are
do
not
carry
dead
fish
into
the
water


dead
fish
can
attract
sharks


do
not
be
in
the
water
at
dawn
or
late
at
night


they
do
not
like
to
hunt
when
it
is
hot
so
come
out
when
the
sun
shining
bright


stay
out
of
dark
muddy
water


do
not
wear
bright
colors
especially
if
they
contrast


do
not
swim
in
places
with
a
steep
drop
off
nearby


sharks
like
to
stay
in
those
drop
offs


never
make
a
shark
angry
by
poking
it
or
trying
to
play
with
it


if
you
see
a
shark
be
calm
and
slow


stare
right
at
the
shark
if
you
see
one


sharks
usually
attack
when
they
are
not
noticed


if
all
else
fails
fight
bravely
with
fists
and
legs
kicking
it
in
the
head
and
nostrils


fishing
some
sharks
are
not
endangered
but
some
are
hunted
for
food
like
shark
<collocation>fin soup</collocation>
or
sport
fishing
