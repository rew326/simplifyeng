quakers
should
try
not
to
hurt
other
people


quakers
should
listen
to
what
other
people
say
even
if
they
think
something
completely
different


quakers
should
tell
the
truth
and
not
lie


quakers
should
not
spend
a
lot
of
money
on
themselves
or
wear
clothes
that
make
them
look
rich


when
quakers
say
inner
light
they
do
not
mean
that
there
is
really
a
light
bulb
inside
them


they
use
the
phrase
inner
light
to
mean
something
else
which
they
might
find
difficult
to
find
words
to
explain


other
words
that
quakers
use
to
mean
similar
things
include
god
spirit
and
love


quakers
think
that
the
truth
is
very
important


they
believe
that
it
is
wrong
to
make
an
oath
or
promise


this
is
because
they
think
people
should
tell
the
truth
all
the
time


making
a
promise
shows
that
they
are
trying
to
be
more
truthful
than
normal


instead
quakers
believe
that
they
should
simply
say
what
they
are
going
to
do


this
is
another
idea
that
has
caused
problems


governments
often
want
people
to
promise
that
they
will
be
loyal
to
the
country


in
a
court
people
have
to
promise
that
they
will
tell
the
truth


quakers
refuse
to
do
these
things


several
countries
now
say
that
quakers
do
not
have
to
make
oaths
but
in
the
past
quakers
were
put
in
prison
for
not
making
oaths


today
quakers
can
sometimes
make
an
affirmation
instead


the
word
affirm
hints
that
whatever
is
being
affirmed
has
already
been
said
or
thought


this
means
that
they
have
to
say
out
loud
what
they
are
going
to
do


for
example
in
court
they
might
say
i
affirm
that
i
will
tell
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth


other
people
would
have
to
say
i
swear
instead
of
i
affirm


many
courts
ask
those
testifying
if
they
swear
or
affirm
to
tell
the
truth
this
covers
quakers
as
well
as
because
people
who
are
not
quakers
also
believe
some
of
the
same
things
as
quakers


being
a
member
there
are
two
types
of
people
in
the
religious
society
of
friends
members
and


quakers
believe
that
neither
is
better
than
the
other
but
there
are
some
differences
between
the
types


quakers
who
are
are
part
of
the
religious
society
of
friends
they
worship
with
friends
and
quakers
like
them
to
be
able
to
do
everything
that
members
can
do


however
there
are
some
important
jobs
such
as
the
people
who
look
after
the
meeting
money
that
quakers
prefer
to
be
done
by
members


members
have
decided
that
they
definitely
want
to
be
quakers
and
have
asked
their
meeting
to
make
them
a
member
to
show
that
they
think
that
quakerism
is
right
for
them

then
that

colonies
a
colony
has
a
female
ant
called
a
queen
who
lays
eggs


those
eggs
will
hatch
into
worker
ants


larger
colonies
of
ants
having
millions
of
ants
mostly
have
female
ants
making
groups
of
workers
soldiers
or
other
special


almost
all
<collocation>ant colonies</collocation>
also
have
some
fertile
male
ants
called
drones


ants
have
colonies
almost
everywhere
on
planet
earth


places
that
do
not
have
ants
are
antarctica
and
certain
far
away
places
or
islands
hard
to
live
on


ants
are
usually
small
but
can
carry
the
weight
of
twenty
ants


usually
worker
ants
will
carry
food
back
to
the
colony
so
that
the
other
ants
and
the
queen
can
eat


some
people
use
ants
for
food
medicine
and
rituals


some
species
of
ants
are
used
for
pest
control
they
eat
pests
that
destroy
food
for
humans


they
can
damage
crops
and

evolution
ants
fossilised
in
<collocation>baltic amber</collocation>


the
family
belongs
to
the
order
hymenoptera
which
also
includes
bees
and
wasps


ants
evolved
from
a
lineage
within
the
wasps


phylogenetic
analysis
suggests
that
ants
arose
in
the
<collocation>lower cretaceous</collocation>
period
about
to
million
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
or
even
earlier


one
estimate
from
studies
places
the
origin
of
ants
at
million
<collocation>years ago</collocation>


another
study
puts
it
in
the
jurassic
at
confidence
limits


after
the
rise
of
<collocation>flowering plants</collocation>
about

<collocation>years ago</collocation>
ants

they
became
ecologically
dominant
about
million
<collocation>years ago</collocation>


in
wilson
and
his
colleagues
identified
the
fossil
remains
of
an
ant
from
the
cretaceous
period


the
specimen
trapped
in
amber
dating
back
to
more
than
million
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
has
features
of
both
ants
and
wasps


was
probably
a
ground
but
some
suggest
that
<collocation>primitive ants</collocation>
were
likely
to
have
been
predators
underneath
the
surface
of
the
soil


during
the
cretaceous
period
a
few
species
of
<collocation>primitive ants</collocation>
ranged
widely
on
the
the
northern
hemisphere


they
were
scarce
in
comparison
to
other
insects
representing
about
of
the
insect
population


ants
became
dominant
after
<collocation>adaptive radiation</collocation>

the
beginning
of

ants

come
to
represent
of
all

of
the
species
that
lived
in
the
eocene
epoch
approximately
one
in
ten
genera
survive
to
the

genera
surviving
today
comprise

sometimes
called

ants
are
not
ants

order


termites
are
actually
more
closely
related
to

and


termites
are

differ
greatly

development
and
reproduction
meat
eater
ant
nest
during
swarming


the
life
of
an
ant
starts
from
an
egg


if
the
egg
is
the
progeny
will
be
female
if
not
it
will
be
male


ants
develop
by
<collocation>complete metamorphosis</collocation>
with
the
<collocation>larval stages</collocation>
passing
through
a
<collocation>pupal stage</collocation>
before
emerging
as
an
adult


the
larva
is
fed
and
cared
for
by
workers


food
is
given
to
the
larvae
by
a
process
in
which
an
ant
liquid
food
held
in
its
crop


this
is
also
how
adults
share
food
stored
in
the
social
stomach
among
themselves


larvae
may
also
be
given
solid
food
brought
back
by
foraging
workers
and
may
even
be
taken
to
captured
prey
in
some
species


the
larvae
grow
through
a
series
of
and
enter
the
<collocation>pupal stage</collocation>


the
differentiation
into
queens
and
workers
which
are
both
female
and
different
of
workers
is
influenced
in
some
species
by
the
food
the
larvae
get


genetic
influences
and
the
control
of
<collocation>gene expression</collocation>
by
the
feeding
are
complex


the
determination
of
caste
is
a
major
subject
of
research


a
new
worker
spends
the
first
few
days
of
its
adult
life
caring
for
the
queen
and
young


it
then
does
digging
and
other
nest
work
and
later
defends
the
nest
and


these
changes
are
sometimes
fairly
sudden
and
define
what
are
called
temporal


an
explanation
for
the
sequence
is
suggested
by
the
high
casualties
involved
in
foraging
making
it
an
acceptable
risk
only
for
ants
that
are
older
and
are
likely
to
die
soon
of
natural
causes


mating
most
ant
species
have
a
system
in
which
only
the
queen
and
breeding
females
can
mate


contrary
to
popular
belief
some
<collocation>ant nests</collocation>
have
multiple
queens
while
others
can
exist
without
queens


workers
with
the
ability
to
reproduce
are
called
and
colonies
that
lack
queens
are
then
called
colonies
colonies
with
queens
are
said
to
be


the
winged
male
ants
called
drones
emerge
from
pupae
with
the
breeding
females
although
some
species
like
army
ants
have
wingless
queens
and
do
nothing
in
life
except
eat
and
mate


the
<collocation>nuptial flight</collocation>
most
ants
produce
a
new
generation
each
year


during
the
species
specific
breeding
period
new
<collocation>winged males</collocation>
and
females
leave
the
colony
in
what
is
called
a
<collocation>nuptial flight</collocation>


typically
the
males
take
flight
before
the
females


males
then
use
visual
cues
to
find
a
common
mating
ground
for
example
a
landmark
such
as
a
pine
tree
to
which
other
males
in
the
area
converge


males
secrete
a
mating
pheromone
that
females
follow


females
of
some
species
mate
with
just
one
male
but
in
some
others
they
may
mate
with
anywhere
from
one
to
ten
or
more
different
males


mated
females
then
seek
a
suitable
place
to
begin
a
colony


there
they
break
off
their
wings
and
begin
to
lay
and
care
for
eggs


the
females
store
the
sperm
they
obtain
during
their
<collocation>nuptial flight</collocation>
to
selectively
<collocation>fertilise future</collocation>
eggs


the
first
workers
to
hatch
are
weak
and
smaller
than
later
workers
but
they
begin
to
serve
the
colony
immediately


they
enlarge
the
nest
forage
for
food
and
care
for
the
other
eggs


this
is
how
new
colonies
start
in
most
species


species
that
have
multiple
queens
may
have
a
queen
leaving
the
nest
along
with
some
workers
to
found
a
colony
at
a
new
site
a
process
akin
to
swarming
in
honeybees


a
wide
range
of
<collocation>reproductive strategies</collocation>
have
been
noted
in
ant
species


females
of
many
species
are
known
to
be
capable
of
reproducing
through
parthenogenesis
and
one
species
is
known
to
be


<collocation>ant colonies</collocation>
can
be


the
queens
can
live
for
up
to
years
and
workers
live
from
to
years


males
however
are
more
transitory
and
survive
only
a
few
weeks


<collocation>ant queens</collocation>
are
estimated
to
live
times
longer
than
<collocation>solitary insects</collocation>
of
a
similar
size


ants
are
active
all
year
long
in
the
tropics
but
in
cooler
regions
survive
the
winter
in
a
state
of
dormancy
or
inactivity


the
forms
of
inactivity
are
varied
and
some
temperate
species
have
larvae
going
into
the
inactive
state
while
in
others
the
adults
alone
pass
the
winter
in
a
state
of
reduced
activity
