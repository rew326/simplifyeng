meaning
of
orange
to
the
human
eye
orange
is
a
very
hot
color
so
it
gives
the
sensation
of
heat


but
orange
is
not
as
heated
a
color
as
red


as
a
citrus
color
orange
is
associated
with
healthy
food
and
is
appetising


orange
is
the
color
of
autumn
and
harvest


though
rare
in
heraldry
orange
is
symbolic
of
strength
and
endurance


orange
is
very
easy
to
see
so
people
can
use
it
to
catch
attention
and
highlight
the
most
important
elements
of
a
design


orange
is
very
effective
for
promoting
food
products
and
toys


on
road
signs
the
color
orange
means
there
is
construction
work
ahead


it
is
used
for
these
signs
because
it
can
easily
be
seen
even
at

is
a
new
idea
in
physics
that
is
part
of
theory


the
idea
or
theory
often
causes
arguments
among
scientists
because
there
is
no
way
to
test
it
to
see
if
it
is
true


if
ever
proven
true
and
string
theory
would
mean
big
progress
for
science


string
theory
to
understand
one
must
first
have
some
knowledge
of
string
theory


for
hundreds
of
years
scientists
have
thought
that
the
simplest
objects
in
the
universe
are
points
like
dots


string
theory
says
that
this
is
wrong
and
that
the
simplest
objects
in
the
universe
are
shaped
like
pieces
of
string


these
strings
are
so
small
that
even
when
looked
at
very
closely
they
look
like
points


each
basic
particle
is
created
by
the
strings
vibrating
in
different
patterns


the
reason
scientists
had
not
thought
of
this
idea
for
so
long
is
that
strings
are
much
harder
to
work
with
than
points


they
seem
to
break
such
rules
as
causality
and
special
relativity
which
says
that
information
can
not
travel
faster
than
the
speed
of
light


string
theory
has
been
developed
because
of
a
very
important
problem
that
has
existed
for
almost
years


albert
einstein
theory
that
describes
the
universe
on
very
large
scales
it
is
called
general
relativity
disagrees
with
two
theories
that
describe
things
on
very
small
scales
they
are
called
<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
and
the
<collocation>standard model</collocation>


there
are
also
problems
with
the
<collocation>standard model</collocation>
it
includes
about
numbers
that
seem
to
have
no
explanation
it
has
too
many
basic
particles
some
scientists
think
it
needs
to
have
fewer
and
it
does
not
include
gravity
which
is
needed
to
explain
weight


many
of
these
problems
can
be
solved
by
thinking
of
basic
particles
as
strings


now
there
is
only
one
number
with
no
explanation
which
gives
the
size
of
the
strings


string
theory
includes
particles
that
cause
gravity
called
finding
this
out
delighted
the
scientists
who
work
on
string
theory


so
string
theory
successfully
brings
general
relativity
and
<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
together


but
there
are
some
problems
with
string
theory


normally
we
think
of
the
universe
as
having
dimensions
or
basic
directions


of
these
basic
directions
can
be
thought
of
as
and


the
other
direction
is
time


string
theory
needs
basic
directions


these
six
other
directions
can
be
explained
if
they
are
curled
up
so
they
are
much
too
small
to
see


for
example
by
following
the
path
of
a
spiral
it
is
possible
to
go
a
great
distance
along
it
without
moving
very
far


the
other
directions
can
be
thought
of
as
<collocation>tiny spirals</collocation>
strings
can
move
along
them
a
great
distance
but
not
seem
to
move


this
can
be
looked
at
as
a
mathematical
trick
a
trick
that
has
little
to
do
with
the
real
world
that
can
be
seen
and
touched


<collocation>such tricks</collocation>
are
allowed
if
they
give
a
theory
that
can
better
tell
us
how
things
work


another
problem
with
string
theory
is
that
there
are
different
versions
of
it


each
version
allows
different
kinds
of
strings
and
says
they
work
in
different
ways


string
theory
is
supposed
to
be
a
theory
of
everything
so
there
should
be
only
one
version
not


solves
this
problem


in
edward
witten
started
what
has
been
called
the
second
revolution
by
introducing
to
the
world


this
theory
combines
the
different
string
theories
along
with
a
previously
abandoned
attempt
to
unify
general
relativity
and
<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
called
into
one
theory


what
witten
actually
did
was
to
predict
that
the
fact
that
all
these
different
theories
were
connected
was
a
result
of
there
being
some
underlying
theory
of
which
they
were
all
approximations


this
theory
is
somewhat
vague
in
nature
and
has
not
yet
been
pinned
down


additionally
it
was
found
that
the
equations
that
required
string
theory
to
exist
in
dimensions
were
actually
approximations
as
well


the
proposed
would
need
one
extra
dimension
and
instead
be
a
theory
that
takes
place
in
dimensions


witten
has
himself
compared
this
idea
in
simple
terms
to
a
general
who
takes
up
a
position
on
a
hilltop
the
extra
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
battlefield
two
other
dimensions


the
combination
is
accomplished
by
knitting
together
a
web
of
relationships
between
each
of
the
string
theories
called
dualities
specifically
and


each
of
these
dualities
provides
a
way
of
converting
one
of
the
string
theories
into
another


is
probably
the
most
easily
explained
of
the
dualities


it
has
to
do
with
the
size
written
as
r
of
the
curled
up
dimensions
of
the
string
theories


it
was
discovered
that
by
taking
a
type
string
theory
that
has
a
size
r
and
changing
the
radius
to
the
result
will
end
up
being
what
is
equivalent
to
a
type
theory
of
size
this
duality
along
with
the
others
creates
connections
between
all
or
if
is
counted
theories


the
fact
that
these
dualities
existed
had
been
known
before
witten
came
up
with
the
idea
of


additional
amusement
has
come
for
many
in
guessing
what
the
m
might
stand
for
possibilities
include
matrix
magic
muffin
mystery
mother
and
membrane


regardless
of
what
the
m
might
possibly
mean
has
become
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
active
areas
of
research
in
theoretical
physics
today

criterion
what
distinguishes
a
scientific
method
of
inquiry
is
a
question
known
as
the
criterion


it
is
an
answer
to
the
question
is
there
a
way
to
tell
whether
a
concept
or
theory
is
science
as
opposed
to
some
other
kind
of
knowledge
or
belief


there
have
been
many
ideas
as
to
how
it
should
be
expressed


logical
thought
a
theory
was
scientific
if
it
could
be
verified
but
popper
thought
this
was
a
mistake


he
thought
a
theory
was
not
scientific
unless
there
was
some
way
it
might
be
refuted


scientists
try
to
let
reality
speak
for
itself


they
support
a
theory
when
its
predictions
are
confirmed
and
challenge
it
when
its
predictions
prove
false


scientific
researchers
<collocation>offer hypotheses</collocation>
as
explanations
of
phenomena
and
design
experiments
to
test
these
hypotheses


since
big
theories
can
not
be
tested
directly
it
is
done
by
testing
predictions
derived
from
the
theory


these
steps
must
be
repeatable
to
guard
against
mistake
or
confusion
in
any
<collocation>particular experimenter</collocation>


<collocation>scientific inquiry</collocation>
is
generally
intended
to
be
as
objective
as
possible


to
reduce
biased
interpretations
of
results
scientists
publish
their
work
and
so
share
data
and
methods
with
other
scientists


stages
science
and
things
that
are
not
science
such
as
pseudoscience
are
often
distinguished
by
whether
they
use
the
scientific
method


one
of
the
first
people
to
create
an
outline
of
the
steps
in
the
scientific
method
was
john
<collocation>stuart mill</collocation>


there
is
no
one
scientific
method
but
in
general
it
is
usually
written
as
a
number
of
steps
come
up
with
a
question
about
the
world


all
scientific
work
begins
with
having
a
question
to
ask
or
a
problem
to
solve


sometimes
just
coming
up
with
the
right
question
is
the
hardest
part
for
a
scientist


the
question
should
be
answerable
by
means
of
an
experiment


create
a
hypothesis
one
possible
answer
to
the
question


a
hypothesis
in
science
is
a
word
meaning
an
educated
guess
about
how
something
works


it
should
be
possible
to
prove
it
right
or
wrong


for
example
a
statement
like
blue
is
a
better
color
than
green
is
not
a
scientific
hypothesis


it
can
not
be
proved
right
or
wrong


more
people
like
the
color
blue
than
green
could
be
a
scientific
hypothesis
though
because
one
could
ask
many
people
whether
they
like
blue
more
than
green
and
come
up
with
an
answer
one
way
or
the
other


design
an
experiment


if
the
hypothesis
is
truly
scientific
it
should
be
possible
to
design
an
experiment
to
test
it


an
experiment
should
be
able
to
tell
the
scientist
if
the
hypothesis
is
wrong
it
may
not
tell
him
or
her
if
the
hypothesis
is
right


in
the
example
above
an
experiment
might
involve
asking
many
people
what
their
favorite
colors
are


making
an
experiment
can
be
very
difficult
though


what
if
the
key
question
to
ask
people
is
not
what
colors
they
like
but
what
colors
they
hate


how
many
people
need
to
be
asked


are
there
ways
of
asking
the
question
that
could
change
the
result
in
ways
that
were
not
expected


these
are
all
the
types
of
questions
that
scientists
have
to
ask
before
they
make
an
experiment
and
do
it


usually
scientists
want
to
test
only
one
thing
at
a
time


to
do
this
they
try
to
make
every
part
of
an
experiment
the
same
for
everything
except
for
the
thing
they
want
to
test


experiment
and
collect
the
data


here
the
scientist
tries
to
run
the
experiment
they
have
designed
before


sometimes
the
scientist
gets
new
ideas
as
the
experiment
is
going
on


sometimes
it
is
difficult
to
know
when
an
experiment
is
finally
over


sometimes
experimenting
will
be
very
difficult


some
scientists
spend
most
of
their
lives
learning
how
to
do
good
experiments


draw
conclusions
from
the
experiment


sometimes
results
are
not
easy
to
understand


sometimes
the
experiments
themselves
open
up
new
questions


sometimes
results
from
an
experiment
can
mean
many
different
things


all
of
these
need
to
be
thought
about
carefully


communicate
them
to
others


a
key
element
of
science
is
sharing
the
results
of
experiments
so
that
other
scientists
can
then
use
the
knowledge
themselves
and
all
of
science
can
benefit


usually
scientists
do
not
trust
a
new
claim
unless
other
scientists
have
looked
it
over
first
to
make
sure
it
sounds
like
real
science


this
is
called
peer
review
peer
here
means
other
scientists


work
that
passes
peer
review
is
published
in
a
scientific
journal


not
all
scientists
use
the
above
scientific
method
in
their
day
to
day
work


sometimes
the
actual
work
of
science
looks
nothing
like
the
above


but
on
the
whole
it
is
thought
to
be
a
good
method
for
finding
out
things
about
the
world
which
are
reliable
and
is
the
model
for
thinking
about
scientific
knowledge
most
used
by
scientists


example
dissolving
sugar
in
water
let
say
we
are
going
find
out
the
effect
of
temperature
on
the
way
sugar
dissolves
in
a
glass
of
water


below
is
one
way
to
do
this
following
the
scientific
method
step
by
step


aim
does
sugar
dissolve
faster
in
hot
water
or
cold
water


does
the
temperature
affect
how
fast
the
sugar
dissolves


this
is
a
question
we
might
want
to
ask


planning
the
experiment
one
simple
experiment
would
be
to
dissolve
sugar
in
water
of
different
temperatures
and
to
keep
track
of
how
much
time
it
takes
for
the
sugar
to
dissolve


this
would
be
a
test
of
the
idea
that
the
rate
of
dissolving
varies
according
to
the
<collocation>kinetic energy</collocation>
of
the
solvent


we
want
to
make
sure
to
use
the
exact
same
amount
of
water
in
each
trial
and
the
exact
same
amount
of
sugar


we
do
this
to
make
sure
that
the
temperature
alone
causes
the
effect


it
might
be
for
example
that
the
ratio
of
sugar
to
water
is
also
a
factor
in
the
rate
of
dissolving


to
be
extra
careful
we
might
also
run
the
experiment
so
that
the
water
temperature
does
not
change
during
the
experiment


this
is
called
isolating
a
variable


this
means
that
of
the
factors
which
might
have
an
effect
only
one
is
being
changed
in
the
experiment


running
the
experiment
we
will
do
the
experiment
in
three
trials
which
are
exactly
the
same
except
for
the
temperature
of
the
water


we
put
exactly
grams
of
sugar
into
exactly
liter
of
water
almost
as
cold
as
ice


we
do
not
stir


we
notice
that
it
takes
minutes
before
all
the
sugar
is
dissolved


we
put
exactly
grams
of
sugar
into
exactly
liter
of
room
temperature
water
c


we
do
not
stir


we
notice
that
it
takes
minutes
before
all
the
sugar
is
dissolved


we
put
exactly
grams
of
sugar
into
exactly
liter
of
warm
water
c


we
do
not
stir


we
notice
that
it
takes
minutes
before
all
the
sugar
is
dissolved


drawing
conclusions
one
way
that
makes
it
easy
to
see
results
is
to
make
a
table
of
them
listing
all
of
the
things
that
changed
each
time
we
ran
the
experiment


ours
might
look
like
this
temperature
dissolving
time
c
min
c
min
c
min
if
every
other
part
of
the
experiment
was
the
same
we
did
not
use
more
sugar
one
time
than
the
other
we
did
not
stir
one
time
or
the
other
then
this
would
be
very
good
evidence
that
heat
affects
how
fast
sugar
is
dissolved


we
can
not
know
for
sure
though
that
there
is
not
something
else
affecting
it


an
example
of
a
hidden
cause
might
be
that
sugar
dissolves
faster
each
time
more
sugar
is
dissolved
into
the
same
pot


this
is
probably
not
true
but
if
it
were
it
could
make
the
results
exactly
the
same
three
trials
and
the
last
one
would
be
fastest


we
have
no
reason
to
think
that
this
is
true
at
this
time
but
we
might
want
to
note
it
as
another
possible
answer


elements
of
scientific
method
were
worked
out
by
some
early
students
of
nature


we
consider
it
a
good
principle
to
explain
the
phenomena
by
the
<collocation>simplest hypothesis</collocation>
possible


this
is
an
early
example
of
what
we
call
razor


robert
and
roger
bacon
all
made
some
progress
in
developing
scientific
method
