problems
with

are
the
among
the
first
signs
of
alzheimer

as
of
there
is
no
cure
for
alzheimer
disease


with
time
the
different
symptoms
of
the
disease
become
more
marked


many
people
die
because
of
alzheimer
disease


the
disease
affects
different
parts
of
the
brain
but
has
its
worst
effects
on
the
areas
of
the
brain
that
control
memory

alzheimer

is
the
most

form
of
senile

for
up

of
cases


the
clinical
symptoms
of
ad
usually
occurs
after
age
but
changes
in
the
brain
which
do
not
cause
symptoms
and
are
caused
by
alzheimer
may
begin
years
or
in
some
cases
decades
before


although
the
symptoms
of
ad
begin
in
older
people
it
is
not
a
normal
part
of
aging


at
this
time
there
is
no
cure
for
alzheimer
but
there
are
treatments
that
can
help
some
patients
with
the
signs
and
symptoms
so
they
do
not
affect
them
as
badly


there
are
also
treatments
which
slow
down
the
disease
so
the
damage
to
the
brain
does
not
happen
as
quickly


there
are
also
certain
personal
habits
that
people
can
learn
which
may
help
to
delay
the
onset
of
the
disease


while
it
is
not
yet
known
exactly
what
causes
alzheimer

there
are
a
number
of
<collocation>risk factors</collocation>
which
may

a

more

to
get
it


some
of
these
<collocation>risk factors</collocation>
are
genetic
changes
to
four
different
genes
have
been
found

the

is
the

deep
within
the
brain


neurons
start
dying
in
this
area
first


it
then
spreads
into
the
adjacent
cortex
ec
which
acts
as
a
central
hub
for
a
widespread
network
that
handles
signals
for
memory
and
movement
like
a
main
train
station
with
train
tracks
going
to
different
areas


the
region
a
narrow
area
of
the
medial
temporal
lobe
is
first
affected
by
alzheimer
disease
it
then
spreads
to
the
area
next
to
it
in
the
temporal
lobe
the
region
or
cortex


the
ec
is
the
main
area
for
communication
between
the
hippocampus
and
the
neocortex
which
is
the
outer
portion
of
the
brain
responsible
for
higher
functioning
such
as
how
the
brain
perceives
information
from
the
five
senses
smell
sight
taste
touch
and
hearing
ex


seeing
a
person
face
and
recognizing
them
generating
motor
commands
ex
moving
and
arm
or
leg
walking
running
spatial
reasoning
conscious
thought
and
language


the
disease
then
spreads
into
the
hippocampus
which
is
part
of
the
limbic
system


the
hippocampus
is
the
part
of
the
brain
that
is
involved
in
forming
new
memories
organizing
them
and
storing
them
for
later
recall


it
is
also
where
emotions
and
senses
such
as
smell
and
sound
are
attached
to
specific
memories


example
a
memory
might
make
you
happy
or
sad


example
a
smell
might
bring
up
a
certain
memory


the
hippocampus
then
sends
memories
to
the
different
parts
of
the
<collocation>cerebral hemisphere</collocation>
where
they
are
placed
in
storage
and
it
helps
retrieve
them
when
necessary


example
an
adult
trying
to
remember
the
name
of
a
classmate
from
kindergarten


in
addition
to
handling
memory
the
hippocampus
is
also
involved
in
<collocation>emotional responses</collocation>
navigation
getting
around
and
<collocation>spatial orientation</collocation>
knowing
your
sense
of
place
as
you
move
around
example
knowing
your
way
around
your
bedroom
even
with

lights
off


there
are
actually
two
parts
of
the
hippocampus
which
is
shaped
like
a
horseshoe
with
one
in
the
left
part
of
the
brain

a
short
example
of
the
test


the
test
is
used
to
measure
different
cognitive
functions
such
as
<collocation>selective attention</collocation>


naming
the
colors
of
the
first
set
of
words
is
easier
and
quicker
than
the
second
because
in
the
first
set
the
colors
match
the
words
in
the
second
set
they
do
not


so
a
person
has
to
pay
more
attention


people
having
problems
with
attention
as
may
happen
in
alzheimer
tend
to
do
poorly
on
this
test


with
current
research
using
advances
in
such
as
and
scans
and
cerebrospinal
fluid
assays
it
is
now
possible
to
detect
the
beginning
processes
of
alzheimer
disease
that
occur
before
symptoms
begin


the
research
suggests
that
clinically
normal
older
people
no
symptoms
at
all
have
evidence
of
beta
in
the
brain


this
beta
is
linked
to
changes
in
the
structure
of
the
brain
and
how
it
works
that
is
the
similar
to
what
is
seen
in
people
with
<collocation>mild cognitive</collocation>
impairment
which
may
lead
to
alzheimer
and
people
with
alzheimer


these
small
changes
no
symptoms
in
the
brain
may
occur
many
years
to
even
a
few
decades
before
a
person
is
diagnosed
with
alzheimer


with
a
stage
where
there
is
some
memory
loss
or
<collocation>mild cognitive</collocation>
impairment


these
changes
put
a
person
at
risk
of
developing
the
clinical
symptoms
of
alzheimer
but
not
everyone
who
has
these
changes
will
get
the
disease


even
though
there
is
no
cure
for
alzheimer
there
are
new
treatments
which
are
being
developed
which
would
work
better
in
the
very
first
stages
of
the
disease


at
this
time
exactly
what
makes
up
the
phase
of
alzheimer
is
still
being
researched
such
as
why
some
people
with
go
on
to
develop
alzheimer
and
others
do
not


so
the
term
phase
is
being
used
for
research
only


there
is
a
worldwide
effort
in
various
countries
doing

in

beginning

misdiagnosis
in

there

more
