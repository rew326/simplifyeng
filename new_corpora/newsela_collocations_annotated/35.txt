color
hair
color
is
passed
down
by
parents
only


natural
hair
color
can
be
given
only
by
genes


it
is
impossible
to
have
a
hair
color
that
is
not
passed
down
genetically
by
both
mother
and
father


this
relies
on
dominant
and
<collocation>recessive genes</collocation>
carried
by
a
parent


these
genes
may
not
be
the
color
of
their
hair
however
many
people
carry
genes
that
are
recessive
and
do
not
show
in
their
traits
or
features


dyeing
hair
is
to
change
the
color
of
hair


it
consists
of
a
chemical
mixture
which
can
change
the
color
of
hair
by
a
chemical
reaction


many
people
dye
their
hair
to
hide
gray
or
white
hairs


this
is
because
most
people
gain
white
or
gray
hairs
as
they
grow
older


genetics
and
chemistry
two
types
of
melanin
pigment
give
hair
its
color
and


colors
hair
red


determines
the
darkness
of
the
hair
color


a
low
concentration
of
brown
results
in
<collocation>blond hair</collocation>
but
more
brown
will
color
the
hair
brown


high
amounts
of
black
result
in
black
hair
while
<collocation>low concentrations</collocation>
give
gray
hair


all
humans
have
some
in
their
hair


the
genetics
of
hair
colors
are
not
yet
firmly
established


according
to
one
theory
at
least
two
gene
pairs
control
human
hair
color


one
phenotype
has
a
dominant
<collocation>brown allele</collocation>
and
a
recessive
blond
allele


a
person
with
a
<collocation>brown allele</collocation>
will
have
brown
hair
a
person
with
no
brown
alleles
will
be
blond


this
explains
why
two
parents
can
produce
a
child


the
other
gene
pair
is
a
pair
where
the
allele
is
dominant
and
the
allele
for
red
hair
is
recessive


a
person
with
two
copies
of
the
allele
will
have
red
hair
but
it
will
be
either
auburn
or
<collocation>bright reddish</collocation>
orange
depending
on
whether
the
first
gene
pair
gives
brown
or
<collocation>blond hair</collocation>
respectively


the
model
does
not
account
for
all
possible
shades
of
brown
blond
or
red
for
example
platinum
blond
versus
dark
brown
nor
does
it
explain
why
hair
color
sometimes
darkens
as
a
person
ages


several
other
gene
pairs
control
the
light
versus
dark
hair
color
in
a
<collocation>cumulative effect</collocation>
<collocation>quantitative genetics</collocation>

hair
texture
is
also
inherited
genetically


the
thickness
of
hair
its
color
and
its
tendency
to
curl
are
all
inherited


there
are
also
genetic
differences
between

typical
male
pattern
baldness
people
have
about
hairs
on
their
head


about
fall
out
each
day
but
they
usually
grow
back


some
men
are
bald
but
girls
and
women
may
become
bald
if
they
lose
their
hair
from
a
disease
called
alopecia


men
often
lose
some
of
their
hair
as
they
grow
older


this
is
known
as
baldness


doctors
call
it
male
pattern
baldness
because
hairs
often
fall
out
in
similar
places


it
often
begins
by
hair
falling
out
first
from
the
front
of
the
head
and
then
from
the
top
of
the
head


after
a
while
all
that
may
be
left
is
a
some
hair
running
above
the
ears
and
around
the
lower
back
of
the
head


even
though
it
is
unusual
for
women
to
go
bald
many
women
suffer
from
thinning
hair
over
the
top
of
their
head
as
they
grow
old


people
have
tried
to
find
cures
for
<collocation>hair loss</collocation>
for
thousands
of
years


in
an
effort
to
get
their
hair
back
men
have
tried
cures
like
applying
strange
lotions
or
even
having
their
heads
packed
in
chicken
manure


fact
date
april
many
unproven
cures
are
still
marketed
today


it
is
only
in
the
last
decade
or
so
that
treatments
have
been
developed
which
do
sometimes
work


some
doctors
do
hair
transplants
where
they
take
<collocation>tiny plugs</collocation>
of
hair
from
areas
like
the
back
of
the
neck
and
plant
them
in
the
<collocation>bald spots</collocation>
on
the
head


some
drugs
have
been
tested
and
approved
for
sale
as
<collocation>hair loss</collocation>
treatments


they
encourage
<collocation>hair regrowth</collocation>
and
thickening
but
work
better
if
applied
before
<collocation>hair loss</collocation>
turns
to
baldness


history

people
have

interested
in
hair
on

for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years


for
both
men
and
women
styling
and
coloring
hair
have
been
ways
to
look
good
and
get
attention


sometimes
society
makes
rules
about
hair
for
example
by
not
allowing
people
to
cut
their
hair
or
beards
like
in
