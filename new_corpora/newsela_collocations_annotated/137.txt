how
movies
work
a
movie
camera
or
video
camera
takes
pictures
very
quickly
usually
at
pictures
frames
every
second


when
a
movie
projector
a
computer
or
a
television
shows
the
pictures
at
that
rate
it
looks
like
the
things
shown
in
the
set
of
pictures
are
really
moving


sound
is
either
recorded
at
the
same
time
or
added
later


the
sounds
in
a
movie
usually
include
the
sounds
of
people
talking
which
is
called
dialogue
music
which
is
called
the
soundtrack
and
sound
effects
the
sounds
of
activities
that
are
happening
in
the
movie
such
as
doors
opening
or
guns
being
fired


how
movies
are
made
a
screenwriter
writes
a
script
which
is
the
story
of
the
movie
with
words
that
the
actors
will
say


then
a
producer
hires
people
to
work
on
the
movie
and
gets
all
of
the
money
that
will
be
needed
to
pay
for
the
actors
and
the
equipment


producers
usually
get
the
money
by
borrowing
it
from
a
bank
or
by
getting
investors
to
lend
money
to
the
movie
production


some
producers
work
for
a
movie
studio
other
producers
are
independent
they
do
not
work
for
a
movie
studio


actors
and
directors
read
scripts
to
find
out
what
to
say
and
what
to
do


the
actors
memorize
the
words
from
the
script
that
they
will
say
in
the
movie
and
learn
the
actions
that
the
script
tells
them
to
do


then
the
director
tells
the
actors
what
to
do
and
a
cameraman
takes
motion
pictures
of
them
with
a
<collocation>motion picture</collocation>
camera


when
filming
has
finished
an
editor
puts
the
moving
pictures
together
in
a
way
that
tells
the
whole
story
within
a
set
amount
of
time


audio
engineers
and
sound
engineers
record
music
and
singing
and
join
it
with
the
moving
pictures


when
the
movie
is
done
many
copies
of
the
movie
are
made
by
movie
labs
and
put
onto
movie
reels


then
the
movie
reels
are
sent
to
cinemas


an
electric
machine
called
a
projector
shines
a
very
bright
light
through
the
movie
and
people
sitting
in
a
dark
room
see
it
on
