the

of

when

use
this

as

distribution

the
lion
leo
is
a
large
mammal
of
the
cat
family


some
large
males
weigh
over

kg

so
it
is
the
living
cat
after
the
tiger


today
wild
lions
live
in
sub
africa
and
in
asia


lions
are
adapted
for
life
in
grasslands
and
mixed
areas
with
trees
and
grass


the
relatively
small
females
are
fast
runners
over
short
distances
and
their
hunting
of
herd
animals


lions
have
disappeared
from
north
africa
and
southwest
asia
in
historic
times


until
the
late
pleistocene
about
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
the
lion
was
the
most
widespread
large
land
mammal
after
humans


they
were
found
in
most
of
africa
across
eurasia
from
western
europe
to
india
and
in
the
americas
from
the
yukon
to
peru


the
lion
is
now
a
vulnerable
species


there
was
a
decline
in
its
african
range
of
over
two
decades
in
the
second
half
of
the
century


<collocation>habitat loss</collocation>
and
conflicts
with
humans
are
the
greatest
causes
of
concern


lions
are
often
called
the
king
of
the
beasts


they
are
used
as
symbols
representing
courage


they
appear
in
heraldry
more
often
than
any
other
animal


they
are
an
icon
of
courage
and
royalty


lions
live
for
to
years
when
they
are
in
the
wild


when
they
are
captured
they
can
live
longer
than
years


in
the
wild
males
do
not
usually
live
longer
than
years


this
is
because
wounds
from
fighting
with
other
males
make
their
lives
shorter


they
usually
live
in
savanna
and
grassland
though
they
sometimes
live
in
bushes
and
forests


compared
to
other
cats
lions
are
very
social


a
group
of
lions
is
called
a
pride


in
a
pride
of
lions
there
are
related
females
their
young
and
a
small
number
of
adult
males


groups
of
female
lions
often
hunt
together

live

groups
that
are
called
prides


ten
to
forty
lions
may
live
in
a
pride


each
pride
has
a
home
area
that
is
called
its
territory


lions
do
not
allow
other
carnivores
animals
to
hunt
in
their
territory


a
territory
can
be
as
large
as
convert
off
on


the
lions
roar
is
distinct
to
each
individual
and
is
used
for
territorial
making
and
warning
off
other
lions
in
separate
prides
or
<collocation>lone individuals</collocation>


this
however
is
usually
carried
out
by
competing
males


lions
are
not
built
for
speed
like
cheetahs
but
are
for
stealth


the
females
usually
do
the
hunting
for
the
pride


however
the
males
can
sometimes
help
if
needed
to
take
down
large
animals


the
lion
has
large
canines
which
it
uses
to
suffocate
its
prey
by
biting
its
neck
and
crushing
its
throat


it
also
has
long
retractable
claws
which
act
like
grappling
hooks
to
keep
hold
of
the
prey
whilst
delivering
the
bite


breeding
a
lioness
is
ready
to
have
young
when
she
is
years
old


baby
lions
are
called
cubs


cubs
are
born
after
months


the
cubs
are
born
blind
their
eyes
do
not
open
until
they
are
about
a
week
old
and
can
not
see
well
until
they
are
about
two
weeks
old


lions
do
not
have
a
den
home
where
they
would
live
for
a
long
time


the
lioness
conceals
the
cubs
in
thick
bush
gullies
or
rocky


if
the
hiding
place
has
been
seen
by
other
predators
then
the
lioness
will
move
the
cubs
to
a
new
hiding
place


the
cubs
will
be
introduced
to
the
pride
at
about
weeks
old


the
cubs
are
very
vulnerable
when
the
lioness
goes
out
to
hunt
and
needs
to
leave
the
cubs
behind


also
when
a
new
male
takes
over
a
pride
from
another
male
he
usually
kills
all
of
the
cubs


the
cubs
mothers
will
then
mate
with
the
new
pride
male
which
means
that
the
first
batch
of
new
cubs
will
be
his
offspring


a
litter
of
usually
cubs
are
born
and
most
of
the
time
only
cubs
survive
until
introduced
to
the
pride
where
they
are
protected
by
the
whole
pride


in

have
been
