reasons
to
build
a
tunnel
a
subway
is
based
on
a
network
of
tunnels
that
are
dug
underground
so
the
trains
will
not
disturb
and
will
not
be
disturbed
by
the
local
transport


on
the
path
of
a
railroad
track
or
a
road
a
tunnel
is
dug
when
the
lane
encounters
an
obstacle
such
as
a
mountain
to
avoid
bypassing
the
obstacle


a
tunnel
is
built
sometimes
to
overcome
a
water
obstacle
as
a
replacement
for
building
a
bridge
above
it


a
tunnel
is
built
to
connect
between
military
posts
so
the
movement
between
them
will
not
be
visible
for
the
enemy


a
tunnel
is
built
for
infrastructure
like
electricity
cables
water
communication
and
sewerage
to
avoid
damage
and
disruption
above
ground


some
tunnels
are
used
by
prisoners
to
escape
jail


sometimes
tunnels
are
used
by
criminals
to
do
a
bank
robbery

brazil

history
the
nickname
the
tube
comes
from
the
round
tunnels
some
trains
use


the
tube
train
shown
is
in
a
tunnel
near
central
station
london


beginnings
the
metropolitan
line
was
the
first
part
of
the
underground
to
be
made


it
was
opened
in


it
then
ran
between
and


it
took
passengers
per
day


later
it
was
made
longer


the
district
line
was
built
by
a
different
company


in
the
circle
line
was
finished


all
these
lines
used
<collocation>steam engines</collocation>
at
first


in
a
line
using
electric
trains
was
opened


it
was
much
deeper
below
ground
than
the
other
lines


now
it
is
part
of
the
northern
line


more
lines
like
this
were
opened


people
liked
them
so
in
the
lines
that
used
<collocation>steam engines</collocation>
were
changed
to
use
electric
trains


into
the
century
because
the
different
lines
were
run
by
different
companies
changing
lines
was
difficult


between
and
charles
bought
most
of
the
companies
and
formed
a
company
named
underground
<collocation>electric railways</collocation>
of
london
company
short


in
the
and
in
a
company
was
formed
of
all
the
bus
tram
and
underground
companies
called
london
passenger
transport
board


it
planned
to
make
the
network
longer
but
the
second
<collocation>world war</collocation>
stopped
this


in
the
war
some
underground
stations
were
used
as
shelters
against
bombs


after
the
war
after
the
war
more
passengers
used
the
underground


because
of
that
they
built
the
victoria
line
which
took
over
many
passengers


the
piccadilly
line
was
built
farther
to
airport

the
jubilee
line
was

on

when
most
of
the
stations
in
the
london
underground
system
were
built
disabled
and
<collocation>wheelchair access</collocation>
was
not
considered


while
many
stations
have
only
a
few
steps
to
the
platform
nearly
all
underground
stations
have
some
of
the
systems
escalators
and
lifts
elevators


newer
stations
include
<collocation>disabled access</collocation>
and
many
older
stations
install
<collocation>disabled access</collocation>
when
they
are
refurbished
or
rebuilt


since
maps
inside
the
trains
show
which
stations
have
access
from
street
level


transport
for
london
plan
to
have
a
network
of
over
fully
<collocation>accessible stations</collocation>
by
which
means
that
of
<collocation>tube journeys</collocation>
can
be
made
with
access


the
escalators
in
the
london
underground
system
are
some
of
the
longest
in
europe


they
run
hours
a
day
days
a
year
and
are
used
by
people
per
hour
with
of
them
running
at
one
time


safety
accidents
<collocation>platform screen</collocation>
doors
at
westminster
station


there
have
been
relatively
few
accidents
in
the
underground
history


most
happen
if
people
accidentally
fall
onto
the
tracks


in
some
stations
there
are
pits
in
the
middle
of
the
track
to
stop
people
being
injured
if
they
fall
onto
the
track


newly
rebuilt
parts
of
the
system
especially
on
the
jubilee
line
have
<collocation>platform doors</collocation>


these
doors
only
open
when
a
train
stops
and
prevent
people
falling
or
jumping
onto
the
tracks


<collocation>platform doors</collocation>
in
recent
years
refurbished
and
rebuilt
parts
of
the
underground
especially
the
jubilee
line
around
westminster
have
had
sliding
<collocation>platform doors</collocation>
installed
to
prevent
people
falling
off
the
platform
onto
the
tracks
and
suicides


bomb
attacks
in
the
and
the
underground
was
bombed
many
times
by
the
ira
and
for
this
reason
there
have
been
no
in
or
around
stations
until
very
recently
when
clear
<collocation>plastic sacks</collocation>
were
introduced
in
some
parts
of
the
system


on
july
there
were
three
attacks
by
radical
islamic
terrorists
on
two
circle
line
trains
and
on
one
piccadilly
line


<collocation>smoking smoking</collocation>
is
not
allowed
in
any
part
of
the
underground


it
was
banned
after
a
fire
in
king
cross
station
in


criticism
the
commuters
of
london
often
complain
about
the
underground


even
newspapers
especially
the
evening
standard
often
criticise
the
system


usually
the
complaints
are
about
delays
overcrowding
and
the
fares


sometimes
strikes
of
london
underground
staff
occur


fares
london
<collocation>underground fares</collocation>
are
now
the
most
expensive
of
any
rail
system
around
the
world
including
the
luxurious
orient
express
and
they
continue
to
rise
at
very
high
levels


concern
has
also
been
raised
over
the
huge
difference
between
<collocation>oyster card</collocation>
fares
and
cash
fares
with
the
criticism
that
the
high
cash
fares
will
discourage
tourists
and
day
visitors
to
london
from
traveling
around
the
city


delays
because
the
underground
is
a
very
old
system
engineering
work
is
often
needed
and
often
causes
delays


there
can
be
other
reasons
as
well
for
example
<collocation>signal failures</collocation>
or
other
breakdowns


customers
can
claim
a
refund
if
their
tube
journey
is
delayed
for
more
than
minutes
due
to
problems
within
the
control
of
transport
for
london


overcrowding
because
many
more
commuters
use
the
underground
than
planned
overcrowding
often
happens


this
can
cause
stress
and
frustration
with
the
underground
system
among
commuters


according
to
a
report
by
commuters
face
a
daily
trauma
and
are
often
forced
to
travel
in
intolerable
conditions


industrial
action
because
so
many
passengers
travel
on
the
london
underground
network
every
day
strikes
or
industrial
actions
on
the
underground
network
have
a
very
high
impact
on
london
traffic
and
can
impact
on
london
economy


london
underground
and
the
rail
unions
claim
to
be
under
high
pressure
from
the
working
public
private
businesses
and
government
departments


strike
actions
on
the
london
underground
occur
for
a
number
of
reasons
including
health
and
safety
working
conditions
and
pay
levels


there
were
several
such
strikes
in
the
late

party
is
a
socialist
political
party
active

england

and
part
of
the
committee
for
a
workers
international


they
publish
a
weekly
newspaper
entitled
the
socialist
and
a
monthly
socialism
today


as
an
organization
it
has
evolved
from
the
militant
tendency
who
in
the
early
started
to
be
expelled
from
the
labor
party
for
organising
a
mass
campaign
against
the
poll
tax


there
was
a
debate
with
the
militant
tendency
as
to
whether
or
not
to
cease
working
within
the
labor
party
and
the
majority
of
the
group
decided
to
do
so
although
a
minority
around
ted
grant
broke
away
to
form
socialist
appeal


this
debate
ran
alongside
a
parallel
debate
on
the
future
of
scottish
politics


the
result
was
that
the
experiment
of
operating
as
an
open
party
was
first
undertaken
in
scotland
under
the
name
of
scottish
<collocation>militant labor</collocation>


this
initiative
would
eventually
lead
to
the
foundation
of
the
scottish
socialist
alliance


the
majority
of
scottish
members
after
forming
the
scottish
socialist
party
left
the
in
early
as
they
moved
away
from
traditional
politics


for
a
while
the
party
was
known
as
<collocation>militant labor</collocation>


in
the
group
changed
its
name
to
the
socialist
party
but
the
ownership
of
this
name
has
been
contested
by
the
much
older
socialist
party
of
great
britain


as
a
result
the
new
party
is
frequently
known
as
the
socialist
party
of
england
and
wales


in
elections
it
has
had
to
use
the
name
socialist
alternative
