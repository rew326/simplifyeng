of
atoms
atoms


the
atomic
mass
of
an
element
can
be
used
to
see
how
much
of
the
element
makes
a
mole


for
example
the
atomic
mass
of
copper
is
about


that
means
about
grams
of
copper
metal
has
a
mole
of
atoms


the
atomic
mass
of
chlorine
is
about


that
means
grams
of
chlorine
has
a
mole
of
atoms
in
it


moles
can
be
used
to
see
how
many
molecules
are
in
chemical
compounds
too


copper
ii
chloride
is
an
example


is
its
chemical
formula


there
is
one
copper
atom
and
two
chlorine
atoms


add
all
the
molar
masses
of
the
elements
together
and
the
molar
mass
of
the
chemical
compound
is
gotten


that
means
in

there
is
one

acids
and
bases
are
common
chemicals


acids
release
h
ions
when
in
water
and
bases
release
oh
ions
when
in
water


acids
can
react
with
bases


the
h
ion
is
taken
from
the
acid
by
the
base


this
makes
water
h
a

is
also
made
when
an
acid
and
a

react
together


an
example
would
be
reacting
hydrochloric

and
<collocation>sodium hydroxide</collocation>


hydrochloric
acid
releases
h
and
cl
ions
in
water


the
base
releases

common
tasks
for
a
computer

asking
questions
this
is
so
that
they
can
find
new
and
easier
ways
to
do
things
and
the
way
to
approach
problems
with
this
information


asking
the
right
question
computers
can
do
some
things
easily
for
example
simple
math
or
sorting
out
a
list
of
names
from


computers
can
not
do
some
things
though


computers
can
not
answer
questions
when
there
is
not
enough
information
or
when
there
is
no
real
answer


also
computers
may
take
too
much
time
to
finish
long
tasks


for
example
it
may
take
too
long
to
find
the
shortest
way
through
all
of
the
towns
in
the
usa
so
instead
a
computer
will
try
to
make
a
close
guess


a
computer
will
answer
these
simpler
questions
much
faster


answering
the
<collocation>question algorithms</collocation>
are
steps
of
instructions
describing
how
to
complete
a
task
such
as
solving
a
problem


think
about
playing
cards
for
example


a
computer
scientist
wants
to
sort
the
cards


first
he
wants
to
sort
them
out
by
color


then
he
wants
to
order
them
by
number
jack
queen
king
and
ace


the
computer
scientist
may
see
different
ways
to
sort
the
playing
cards


he
must
now
think
about
of
how
he
will
do
it


when
he
decides
he
has
created
an
algorithm


after
making
the
algorithm
the
scientist
needs
to
test
whether
the
algorithm
always
does
what
it
should


then
the
scientist
can
see
how
well
his
program
sorts
the
cards


a
simple
but
very
slow
algorithm
could
be
drop
the
cards
pick
them
up
and
check
whether
they
are
sorted


if
they
are
not
do
it
again


this
method
will
work
but
it
will
often
take
a
very
long
time


the
name
of
this
sorting
algorithm
is


a
person
may
do
this
better
by
looking
through
all
the
cards
finding
the
first
card
of
diamonds
and
putting
it
at
the
start


after
this
he
looks
for
the
second
card
and
so
on


this
works
much
faster
and
does
not
need
much
space


the
name
of
this
sorting
algorithm
is
selection

that
is
able
to
take
information
input
do
some
work
on
or
make
changes
to
the
information
to
make
new
information
output


computers
have
existed
for
much
of
human
history


examples
of
early
computers
are
the
and
the
abacus


modern
computers
are
very
different
from
early
computers


they
are
now
very
powerful
machines
that
are
able
to
do
billions
of
calculations
every
second


most
people
have
used
a
personal
computer
in
their
home
or
at
work


computers
are
useful
for
many
different
jobs
where
<collocation>automatic tasks</collocation>
are
useful


some
examples
are
controlling
traffic
lights
vehicle
computers
security
systems
washing
machines
and
digital
televisions


a
person
called
a
user
can
control
a
computer
by
telling
it
to
do
things


some
ways
of
controlling
a
computer
are
with
a
keyboard
mouse
buttons
touch
screen


some
very
new
computers
can
also
be
controlled
with
voice
commands
or
hand
gestures


computers
can
be
designed
to
do
anything
with
information


computers
are
used
to
control
factories
which
in
the
past
were
controlled
by
humans


they
are
also
in
homes
where
they
are
used
for
things
such
as
listening
to
music
reading
the
news
and
writing


modern
computers
are
electronic
machines


a
computer
is
only
useful
if
it
has
both
hardware
and
software


hardware
is
the
physical
parts
the
computer
is
made
of
for
example
keyboard
mouse
screen
tower
and
the
circuits
inside
it


software
is
the
computer
programs
mathematical
instructions


the
software
uses
the
hardware
when
the
user
gives
it
instructions
and
changing
it
in
to
useful
output


many
modern
computers
do
billions
of
calculations
each
second


they
do
<collocation>mathematical arithmetic</collocation>
very
quickly
but
computers
do
not
really
think


they
only
follow
the
instructions
in
their
software
programs


computer
programs
are
designed
or
written
by
computer
programmers


a
few
programmers
write
programs
in
the
computer
own
language
called
machine
code


machine
code
has
only
a
few
instructions
and
is
based
on
logic
and
<collocation>mathematical arithmetic</collocation>


using
machine
code
is
difficult
for
most
human
programmers


today
programs
are
commonly
written
using
a
programming
language
like
c
java
and


these
programming
languages
are
more
like
the
language
you
talk
and
write
with
every
day


a
program
called
a
compiler
translates
the
user
instructions
into
binary
code
machine
code
and
turns
it
into
useful
information
that
a
user
can
easily
understand
and
then
the
computer
will
understand
the
instructions
and
do
what
is
needed

a
computer
is
an
electronic
machine
which
helps
solving
problems
quickly
and
easily


it
solves
problems
according
to
instructions
given
to
it
by
the
computer
user


<collocation>invention nobody</collocation>
knows
who
built
the
first
computer


this
is
because
the
word
computer
used
to
mean
a
person
who
did
maths
as
their
job
a
human
computer


because
of
this
some
people
say
that
humans
were
the
first
computers


human
computers
got
bored
doing
the
same
maths
over
and
over
again
and
made
tools
mostly
mechanical
calculating
devices
like
abacuses
to
help
them
get
the
answers
to
their
problems


it
is
said
that
the
inventor
of
the
modern
computer
was
charles
babbage


<collocation>automation humans</collocation>
have
a
problem
with
maths


to
show
this
try
doing
x
in
your
head


it
is
hard
to
remember
all
the
steps


people
made
tools
to
help
them
remember
where
they
were
in
a
maths
problem


the
other
problem
people
have
is
that
they
have
to
do
the
same
problem
over
and
over
and
over
again


a
cashier
used
to
make
change
every
day
in
her
head
or
with
a
piece
of
paper


that
took
a
lot
of
time
and
people
made
mistakes


so
people
made
machines
that
did
those
same
things
over
and
over


this
part
of
computer
history
is
called
the
history
of
automated
calculation
which
is
a
<collocation>fancy phrase</collocation>
for
the
history
of
machines
that
make
it
easy
for
me
to
do
this
same
maths
problem
over
and
over
without
making
mistakes


the

the

which
dates
from

are
examples

programming
main
computer

some
people
did
not
want
a
machine
that
would
do
the
same
thing
over

over
again


for
example
a
music
box
is
a
machine
that
plays
the
same
music
over
and
over
again


some
people
wanted
to
be
able
to
tell
their
machine
to
do
different
things


for
example
they
wanted
to
tell
the
music
box
to
play
different
music
every
time


they
wanted
to
be
able
to
program
the
music
box
to
order
the
music
box
to
play
different
music


this
part
of
computer
history
is
called

which
is
a
<collocation>fancy phrase</collocation>
for
the
history
of
machines
that
i
can

one
of
the
first
examples
of
this
was
built
by
hero
of
alexandria
ad


he
built
a
mechanical
theater
which
performed
a
play
lasting
minutes
and
was
operated
by
a
complex
system
of
ropes
and
drums


these
ropes
and
drums
were
the
language
of
the
machine
they
told
what
the
machine
did
and
when


some
people
argue
that
this
is
the
first
programmable
machine


most
historians
agree
that
the
castle
clock
an
<collocation>astronomical clock</collocation>
invented
by

other
europeans
made
more
calculators
after
him


they
were
not

because
they
could
only
add
subtract
and
multiply
you
could
not
change
what
they
did
to
make
them
do
something
like
play


because
of
this
we
say
they
were
not

in
joseph

the
punch
cards
which
means
he
could
program
the
loom
to
weave
the
pattern
he
wanted


this
means
the
loom
was
programmable


modern
computers
were
made
when
someone
charles
babbage
had
an
idea


he
wanted
to
make
a
machine
that
could
do
all
the
boring
parts
of
math
like
the
automated
calculators
and
could
be
told
to
do
them
different
ways
like
the
<collocation>programmable machines</collocation>


charles
babbage
was
the
first
to
make
a
design
of
a
fully
<collocation>programmable mechanical</collocation>
computer


he
called
it
the
the
analytical
engine


because
babbage
did
not
have
enough
money
and
always
changed
his
design
when
he
had
a
better
idea
he
never
built
his
analytical
engine


as
time
went
on
computers
got
more
and
more
popular


and
that
stands
out
at
the
beginning


this
is
because
people
get
bored
easily
doing
the
same
thing
over
and
over


imagine
spending
your
life
writing
things
down
on
index
cards
storing
them
and
then
having
to
go
find
them
again


the
census
bureau
in
had
hundreds
of
people
doing
just
that


people
got
very
bored
and
very
frustrated
and
would
say
there
has
to
be
an
easier
way
to
do
this


then
a
clever
person
worked
out
how
to
make
machines
do
a
lot
of
the
work


herman
figured
out
how
to
make
a
machine
that
would
automatically
add
up
information
that
the
census
bureau
collected


the
computing
tabulating
<collocation>recording corporation</collocation>
which
later
became
ibm
made
his
machines
and
everyone
was
happy


at
least
they
were
happy
until
their
machines
broke
down
got
jammed
and
had
to
be
repaired


this
is
when
the
computing
tabulating
<collocation>recording corporation</collocation>
invented
<collocation>tech support</collocation>


because
of
machines
like
this
new
ways
of
talking
to
these
machines
were
invented
and
new
types
of
machines
were
invented
and
eventually
the
computer
as
we
know
it
was
born


analog
and
digital
computers
in
the
first
half
of
the
century
scientists
started
using
computers
mostly
because
scientists
had
a
lot
of
math
to
figure
out
and
wanted
to
spend
more
of
their
time
thinking
about
the
secrets
of
the
universe
instead
of
spending
hours
adding
numbers
together


for
example
if
they
had
to
launch
a
rocket
ship
they
needed
to
do
a
lot
of
math
to
make
sure
the
rocket
did
not
blow
up


so
they
put
together
computers


these
computers
used
<collocation>analog circuits</collocation>
which
made
them
very
hard
to
program


then
in
the
they
invented
digital
computers
which
made
them
easier
to
program


computers
scientists
figured
out
how
to
make
and
use
digital
computers
in
the
and


scientists
made
a
lot
of
digital
computers
and
as
they
did
they
figured
out
how
to
ask
them
the
right
sorts
of
questions
to
get
the
most
out
of
them


here
are
a
few
of
the
computers
they
built
early
computer
characteristics
was
one
of
the
first
computers
that
remembered
what
you
told
it
even
after
you
turned
the
power
off


this
is
called
von
architecture


the
was
the
first
working
machine
that
used
<collocation>binary arithmetic</collocation>


<collocation>binary arithmetic</collocation>
means
using
yes
and
to
add
numbers
together


you
could
also
program
it


in
the
was
proved
to
be
complete


complete
means
that
it
is
possible
to
tell
this
particular
computer
anything
that
it
is
mathematically
possible
to
tell
a
computer


it
is
the
world
first
modern
computer


the
berry
computer
which
used
vacuum
tubes
to
store
yes
and
no
answers
and
regenerative
<collocation>capacitor memory</collocation>


the
harvard
mark
i
a
big
computer
that
you
could
kind
of
program


the
army
ballistics
research
laboratory
which
could
add
numbers
the
way
people
do
using
the
numbers
through
and
is
sometimes
called
the
first
general
purpose
electronic
computer
since
of
used
electromagnets
instead
of
electronics


at
first
however
the
only
way
you
could
reprogram
was
by
rewiring
it


several
developers
of
saw
its
problems


they
invented
a
way
to
for
a
computer
to
remember
what
they
had
told
it
and
a
way
to
change
what
it
remembered


this
is
known
as
stored
program
architecture
or
von
architecture


john
von
talked
about
this
design
in
the
paper
first
draft
of
a
report
on
the
distributed
in


a
number
of
projects
to
develop
computers
based
on
the
architecture
started
around
this
time


the
first
of
these
was
completed
in
great
britain


the
first
to
be
demonstrated
working
was
the
manchester
<collocation>experimental machine</collocation>
or
baby
while
the
completed
a
year
after
was
the
first
really
useful
computer
that
used
the
stored
program
design


shortly
afterwards
the
machine
originally
described
by
von
paper
was
completed
but
was
not
ready
for
two
years


nearly
all
modern
computers
use
the
architecture
in
some
form


it
has
become
the
main
concept
which
defines
a
modern
computer
