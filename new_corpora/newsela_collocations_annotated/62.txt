after
this
the
most
common
way
of
trying
to
find
pi
was
to
draw
a
shape
of
many
sides
inside
any
circle
and
use
the
area
of
the
shape
to
find
measure
pi


the
greek
philosopher
archimedes
for
example
used
a
polygon
shape
that
had
sides
in
order
to
find
the
value
of
pi
but
the
chinese
in
were
able
to
use
a
polygon
with
sides
to
find
the
value
of
pi


the
greeks
like
of
were
also
busy
with
finding
out
other
properties
of
the
circle
such
as
how
to
make
squares
of
circles
and
squaring
the
number
pi


since
then
many
people
have
been
trying
to
find
out
more
and
more
exact
values
of
pi

in

better
and
better
ways
of
finding
pi
became
available
such
as
the
complicated
formula
that
the
french
lawyer
developed


the
first
use
of
the
greek
symbol
was
in
an
essay
written
in
by
william
jones


a
mathematician
named
lambert
also
showed
in
that
the
number
pi
was
irrational
that
is
it
can
not
be
written
as
a
fraction
by
normal
standards


another
mathematician
named
was
also
able
to
show
in
that
pi
was
part
of
the
group
of
numbers
known
as
which
are
numbers
that
can
not
be
the
solution
to
a
<collocation>polynomial equation</collocation>


pi
can
also
be
used
for
figuring
out
many
other
things
beside
circles


the
properties
of
pi
have
allowed
it
to
be
used
in
many
other
areas
of
math
besides
geometry
which
studies
shapes


some
of
these
areas
are
complex
analysis
trigonometry
and
series


pi
in
real
life
today
there
are
different
ways
to
calculate
many
digits
of
pi


this
is
of
limited
use
though


pi
can
sometimes
be
used
to
work
out
the
area
or
the
circumference
of
any
circle


to
find
the
circumference
of
a
circle
use
the
formula
c
circumference
times
diameter


to
find
the
area
of
a
circle
use
the
formula
radius


this
formula
is
sometimes
written
as
a
<collocation>pi r</collocation>
where
r
is
the
variable
for
the
radius
of
any
circle
and
a
is
the
variable
for
the
area
of
that
circle


to
calculate
the
circumference
of
a
circle
with
an
error
of
mm
digits
are
needed
for
a
radius
of
meters
digits
for
a
radius
equal
to
that
of
the
earth
digits
for
a
radius
equal
to
the
distance
from

to

people
generally
celebrate

a
proper
noun
or
proper
name
is
a
noun
representing
a
unique
thing
such
as
london
jupiter
john
hunter
or
toyota
as
opposed
to
a
common
noun
which
represents
a
class
of
things
for
example
city
planet
person
or
corporation


<collocation>proper nouns</collocation>
are
the
only
nouns
in
english
which
have
the
first
letter
capitalized


in
english
<collocation>proper nouns</collocation>
are
not
normally
preceded
by
an
article
or
other
limiting
modifier
such
as
any
or
some
and
are
used
to
denote
a
particular
person
place
or
object
without
regard
to
any
descriptive
meaning
the
word
or
phrase
may
have
for
example
a
town
called
may
be
but
does
not
necessarily
have
to
be
a
new
recently
built
town


which
nouns
are
considered
proper
names
depends
on
language


for
example
names
of
days
and
months
are
considered
proper
names
in
english
but
not
in
spanish
french
swedish
or
finnish
where
they
are
not
capitalized


these
objects
are
all
made
out
of
plastic


a
plastic
is
a
material
that
can
change
its
shape
so
many
things
can
be
made
of
plastic


there
are
many
types
of
plastic


some
can
be
shaped
only
when
they
are
freshly
made
then
they
become
hard
afterwards


others
can
be
changed
by
heating
them
up
or
even
by
melting
them


most
plastics
are
they
do
not
occur
in
nature


they
are
often
made
from
oil
that
comes
out
of
the
ground


the
process
of
making
plastics
is
usually
quite
complicated


most
of
the
materials
that
are
called
plastic
are
polymers


polymers
are
long
chains
of
atoms
bonded
to
one
another


people
experimented
with
plastics
based
on
natural
polymers
for
a
very
long
time


alexander
an
english
inventor
created
the
earliest
form
of
plastic
in


it
was
hard
but
flexible
and
transparent
and
he
called
it


plastic
is
filling
up
the
landfills
and
sometimes
if
you
burn
it
it
releases
toxic
fumes


if
you
do
not
recycle
it
becomes
waste

that

for
at

it
is
often
applied
to
paint
tires
and
other
goods
that
become
toxic
waste
if
not
disposed

properly


it
is
most
familiar
as
the

bottle
where
one
pays
for
the

of
the

at
the

time
as

purchases
what

the

charged
for

bottle
may
be
a
fee
to
buy
the
bottle
separately
from
the

to
buy
what
it
contains


if
one
returns
the
bottle
the
fee
is
returned
and
the
supplier
must
return
the
bottle
for
or
recycling


if
not
one
has
paid
the
fee
and
presumably
this
can
pay
for
landfill
or
litter
control
measures
that
dispose
of
say
a
broken
bottle


also
since
the
same
fee
can
be
collected
by
anyone
finding
and
returning
the
bottle
it
is
common
for
people
to
collect
these
and
return
them
as
a
means
of
surviving


this
is
quite
common
for
instance
among
homeless
people

the
bottle
itself
may
be
considered
simple
property
of
the
purchaser
of
the
contents
or
the
purchaser
may
have
some
obligation
to
return
the

to
some
depot
so
it
can
be
recycled
or


for
the
more
toxic
items
it
is
more
likely
that
returning

is
required
this
principle
is
applied
very
broadly
beyond
bottles
to
paint
and
automobile
parts
such
as
tires


when
purchasing

in

use

of

and
holds
those
profiting
from

legally
responsible

any
outcome
along
the

this
is
also
the
trend
in

rather

of

noting
the
