a
picture
of
a
proton


the
u
stands
for
an
up
quark
and
the
stands
for
a
down
quark


a
proton
is
part
of
an
atom


they
are
found
in
the
nucleus
of
an
atom
along
with
neutrons


the
<collocation>periodic table</collocation>
groups
atoms
according
to
how
many
protons
they
have


a
single
atom
of
hydrogen
the
lightest
kind
of
atom
is
made
up
of
an
electron
moving
around
a
proton


most
of
the
mass
of
this
atom
is
in
the
proton
which
is
almost
times
heavier
than
the
electron


protons
and
neutrons
make
up
the
nucleus
of
every
other
kind
of
atom


in
any
one
element
the
number
of
protons
is
always
the
same


an
atom
atomic
number
is
equal
to
the
number
of
protons
in
that
atom


protons
are
made
of
quarks


a
proton
is
believed
to
be
made
up
of
quarks
two
up
quarks
and
one
down
quark


one
down
quark
has
a
charge
of
and
two
up
quarks
have
a
charge
of
each


this
adds
to
a
charge
of


a
proton
has
a
very
small
mass


the
mass
of
the
proton
is
about
one
atomic
mass
unit


the
mass
of
the
neutron
is
also
about
one
atomic
mass
unit


the
size
of
a
proton
is
determined
by
the
vibration
of
the
quarks
that
are
in
it
and
these
quarks
effectively
form
a
cloud


this
means
that
a
proton
is
not
so
much
a
hard
ball
as
an
area
that
contains
quarks
