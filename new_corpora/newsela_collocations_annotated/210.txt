there
is
a
story
which
is
not
in
the
bible
but
is
part
of
christian
tradition
about
how
the
baby
john
and
the
baby
jesus
met
on
the
road
to
egypt


in
this
scene
john
is
praying
and
the
baby
jesus
raises
his
hand
to
bless
john


the
paintings
have
a
strange
eerie
light
with
soft
deep
shadows


in
the
background
is
a
lake
and
mountains
in

this
had

italy


leonardo
other
important
painting
in
milan
is
even
more
famous


it
is
the
<collocation>last supper</collocation>


the
painting
shows
the
last
meal
shared
by
jesus
with
his
disciples
before
his
capture
and
death


leonardo
chose
to
paint
the
moment
when
jesus
has
said
one
of
you
will
betray
me


leonardo
tells
the
story
of
the
surprise
and
upset
that
this
caused
to
the
twelve
followers
of
jesus


he
tells
the
story
through
the
actions
and
faces
of
the
people
in
the
painting


some
of
them
are
talking
some
of
them
have
stood
up
some
are
raising
their
hands
in
horror


the
novelist
saw
leonardo
at
work


wrote
that
on
some
days
he
would
paint
from
morning
till
night
without
stopping
to
eat


then
for
three
or
four
days
he
would
not
paint
at
all


he
would
often
just
stand
and
look
at
the
painting


said
that
the
prior
of
the
convent
was
very
annoyed


he
asked
to
tell
leonardo
to
work
faster


said
that
leonardo
was
worried
because
he
did
not
think
that
he
could
paint
the
face
of
jesus
well
enough


leonardo
told
the
duke
that
he
might
use
the
face
of
the
prior
as
his
model
for
judas
the
traitor


when
it
was
finished
everyone
that
saw
it
said
that
the
painting
was
a
masterpiece


but
leonardo
had
not
used
<collocation>proper fresco</collocation>
for
the
painting


he
had
used
tempera
over
which
is
not
usually
used
for
wall
painting


soon
the
painting
started
to
grow
mold
and
flake
off
the
wall


in
a
<collocation>hundred years</collocation>
it
was
completely
ruined


even
though
in
some
places
the
paint
has
fallen
right
off
the
wall
the
painting
is
so
popular
that
it
is
printed
and
copied
more
that
any
other
religious
painting
in
the
world


working
life
in
il
moro
was
overthrown


leonardo
left
milan
with
his
servant
and
a
friend
who
was
a
mathematician


they
went
to
venice


leonardo
worked
as
a
military
architect
and
engineer


because
venice
is
a
city
on
many
islands
leonardo
tried
to
think
of
ways
to
defend
the
city
from
a
naval
attack


in
leonardo
went
back
to
florence
taking
his
household
of
servants
and
apprentices
with
him


the
monks
from
the
monastery
of
the
holy
annunciation
gave
leonardo
a
home
and
a
large
workshop


in
some
buildings
which
were
used
by
the
department
of
military
geography
were
being
restored


the
discovered
that
part
of
the
building
was
leonardo

gallery
london
the
virgin
and
child
with
st
anne
and
john
the
baptist
leonardo
started
work
on
a
new
painting


he
drew
a
large
cartoon


this
means
a
drawing
that
is
a
plan
for
the
painting


the
cartoon
showed
the
virgin
mary
sitting
on
the
knee
of
her
mother
st
anne


mary
holds
the
baby
jesus
in
her
arms


jesus
stretches
out
his
hands
to
his
young
cousin
john
the
baptist


says
that
everyone
was
so
amazed
by
the
beautiful
drawing
that
men
and
women
young
and
old
came
in
large
groups
to
see
it
as
if
they
were
attending
a
great
festival


the
drawing
is
now
in
the
national
gallery
london


even
though
it
is
old
and
faded
and
is
kept
in
a
dark
room
people
go
to
the
gallery
to
sit
in
front
of
it
every
day


like
many
of
leonardo
projects
the
painting
was
never
done


the
battle
of
this
is
a
copy
of
leonardo
painting
of
the
battle
of
which
was
damaged
and
then
covered
by
a
wall
around
in
and
leonardo
worked
for
cesare
a
powerful
noble
who
was
the
son
of
pope
alexander
vi


leonardo
traveled
around
italy
with
as
a
military
architect
and
engineer


late
in
leonardo
returned
to
florence


he
rejoined
the
guild
of
st
luke


he
was
given
a
very
important
commission


the
town
council
of
the
city
of
florence
wanted
two
large
frescos
painted
on
the
walls
of
the
most
important
room
of
the
palace


michelangelo
was
to
paint
the
battle
of
and
leonardo
was
to
paint
the
battle
of


leonardo
began
the
project
by
studying
and
drawing
the
faces
of
<collocation>angry men</collocation>
and
fighting
horses


these
drawings
can
still
be
seen
in
his
notebooks


but
unfortunately
this
was
to
be
another
failure
for
leonardo


when
he
painted
the
picture
on
the
wall
instead
of
using
fresco
he
mixed
the
paints
with
oil


the
paint
would
not
dry


leonardo
lit
some
fires
to
dry
it
and
the
painting
melted


peter
paul
rubens
drew
a
copy
of
the
middle
part


after
a
time
the
town
council
covered
it
up
and
got
somebody
else
to
paint
the
wall


michelangelo
did
not
finish
his
painting
either
because
the
pope
called
him
to
rome


mona
main
mona
mona
or
la
louvre
paris
france
in
about
leonardo
began
painting
the
a
portrait
of
a
woman
known
as
mona
the
most
famous
portrait
that
has
ever
been
painted


he
continued
working
on
it
for
many
years


it
is
a
small
picture
painted
in
oil
on
a
<collocation>wooden panel</collocation>


it
shows
the
face
upper
body
and
hands
of
a
woman


she
is
very
plainly
dressed


for
a
portrait
a
woman
would
usually
put
on
her
best
clothes
and
jewellery


mona
has
a
dark
dress
and
a
fine
<collocation>black veil</collocation>
over
her
head


leonardo
often
left
symbols
in
his
paintings
that
give
clues
about
the
person


the
unusual
thing
about
this
picture
is
the
smile


the
smile
is
the
clue
to
her
name
mona


means
the
joking
one


mona
is
short
for
madonna
which
means
my
lady


the
reason
why
the
painting
is
so
famous
is
that
it
seems
to
be
full
of
mystery


mona
eyes
look
out
at
the
viewer


but
can
guess
what
she
is
thinking


her
eyes
and
her
mouth
seem
to
be
smiling


this
is
very
unusual
in
a
portrait
painting


most
people
in
portraits
look
very
serious


it
is
hard
to
tell
what
mona
exact
expression
is


when
a
person
wants
to
read
another
person
feelings
they
look
at
the
corners
of
their
mouth
and
eyes


but
leonardo
has
painted
soft
shadows
in
the
corners
of
mona
mouth
and
eyes
to
disguise
her
expression


the
soft
shadows
are
also
found
on
the
sides
of
her
face
her
neck
and
hands


the
way
that
leonardo
uses
shadow
is
called
which
is
an
italian
word
for
smoke


said
that
the
picture
was
so
beautifully
painted
that
every
other
artist
who
looked
at
it
thought
that
they
could
never
paint
so
well


working
life
in
leonardo
went
back
to
milan
with
his
pupils
and
lived
in
his
own
house
in
porta


some
of
the
pupils
became
painters
antonio
and
marco


made
several
copies
of
the
<collocation>last supper</collocation>


made
a
copy
of
the
virgin
of
the
rocks


and
the
others
painted
many
madonna
and
child
pictures
which
can
still
be
seen
in
<collocation>art galleries</collocation>
and
churches


one
of
pupils
was
a
young
nobleman
called
count


never
became
a
very
good
painter
but
he
loved
leonardo
and
stayed
with
him
until
the
day
he
died


in
september
leonardo
went
to
rome
and
lived
there
until


he
lived
in
the
vatican


the
three
<collocation>greatest painters</collocation>
of
the
high
renaissance
leonardo
michelangelo
and
raphael
were
all
working
in
rome
at
the
same
time


even
though
their
names
are
often
said
together
as
if
they
were
friends
they
were
not


leonardo
at
this
time
was
in
his
sixties
michelangelo
was


he
was
not
friendly
to
either
leonardo
or
raphael


raphael
was
a
very
clever
young
painter
who
learned
a
lot
by
looking
at
the
pictures
painted
by
leonardo
and
michelangelo


but
neither
of
them
was
ever
his
teacher


in
october
king
francis
i
of
france
captured
milan


on
december
there
was
a
meeting
of
francis
i
and
pope
leo
x
in
bologna


leonardo
went
to
the
meeting
with
pope
leo


leonardo
made
an
<collocation>amazing toy</collocation>
to
entertain
king
francis


it
was
a
mechanical
lion
that
could
walk


it
had
doors
in
its
chest
which
opened
and
a
bunch
of
lilies
came
out


lilies
were
the
royal
symbol
of
the
french
kings


old
age
clos
in
france
where
leonardo
lived
from
to
in
francis
i
invited
leonardo
to
go
to
france
with
him


he
gave
leonardo
a
beautiful
house
called
clos
sometimes
called


it
is
near
the
king
palace
chateau


leonardo
spent
the
last
three
years
of
his
life
at
clos
with
his
faithful
friend
and
apprentice
count


the
king
gave
leonardo
a
pension
of


one
of
the
last
paintings
that
leonardo
did
was
a
picture
of
john
the
baptist


his
model
was
with
his
beautiful
long
curling
hair


when
leonardo
was
dying
he
asked
for
a
priest
to
come
so
that
he
could
make
his
confession
and
receive
holy
communion


leonardo
died
at
clos
on
may


king
francis
had
become
a
close
friend


says
that
the
king
held
leonardo
head
in
his
arms
as
he
died


in
his
will
he
asked
that
sixty
beggars
should
follow
his
casket
in
procession


he
was
buried
in
the
chapel
of
the
chateau


leonardo
had
never
married
and
had
no
children
of
his
own


in
his
will
he
left
his
money
his
books
and
most
of
his
paintings
to
count


leonardo
also
remembered
his
other
pupil
and
his
servant
di
who
each
received
half
of
leonardo
vineyards
near
milan


leonardo
left
to
his
serving
woman
a
black
cloak
with
a
fur
edge


was
the
owner
of
leonardo
most
famous
oil
painting
the
mona


he
still
owned
it
a
few
years
later
when
he
died
after
fighting
in
a
duel


king
francis
said
there
had
never
been
another
man
born
in
the
world
who
knew
as
much
as
leonardo
not
so
much
about
painting
sculpture
and
architecture
as
that
he
was
a
very
great
philosopher


drawings
leonardo
did
not
paint
very
many
pictures


but
he
drew
hundreds
of
<collocation>quick sketches</collocation>
plans
maps
and
detailed
drawings


this
is
the
way
that
he
recorded
all
the
interesting
things
that
he
saw
studied
and
thought
about


some
of
leonardo
drawings
are
studies
for
paintings


in
these
drawings
leonardo
planned
the
things
he
was
going
to
paint


some
studies
are
plans
for
whole
paintings


one
of
these
paintings
is
the
large
beautiful
drawing
of
the
madonna
and
child
with
st
anne
and
st
john
the
baptist
that
is
now
in
the
national
gallery
london


many
of
the
studies
show
details
that
leonardo
wanted
to
get
just
right


one
study
shows
a
very
detailed
perspective
drawing
of
the
ruined
buildings
in
the
background
of
the
painting
of
the
magi


other
studies
show
hands
faces
drapery
plants
horses
and
babies


the
earliest
drawing
by
leonardo
that
has
a
date
on
it
is
a
landscape
of
the
valley
which
shows
the
river
the
mountains
castle
and
the
farmlands
beyond

in
great
detail

leonardo
studied
things
all
his
life


he
did
not
go
to
university
to
study


he
studied
by
looking
at
things
in
the
world
around
him


he
looked
at
things
to
see
how
they
were
made
and
how
they
worked


he
drew
the
things
that
he
saw
and
the
discoveries
that
he
made
into
his
notebooks
and
made
notes
about
them


many
of
his
notebooks
are
now
in
museums


there
are
pages
of
notes
and
drawings


many
of
these
are
scientific
studies


leonardo
notebooks
are
hard
to
read
because
he
wrote
backwards
in
mirror
writing


some
people
think
that
perhaps
he
was
trying
to
keep
his
work
secret


this
is
not
true


leonardo
wrote
and
sometimes
drew
with
his
left
hand


in
those
days
pens
were
made
from
a
quill
a
large
feather
that
was
cut
with
a
on
the
end


it
is
hard
for
a
person
to
write
with
a
quill
in
the
ordinary
way
but
quite
easy
to
write
backwards


it
is
likely
that
leonardo
planned
to
publish
the
studies
in
his
notebooks


he
organized
many
pages
carefully
with
one
study
taking
up
the
front
and
back
of
each
page


there
is
a
page
with
drawings
and
writing
about
the
human
heart
and
a
page
about
the
womb
and
the
fetus


one
page
shows
drawings
of
the
muscles
of
a
shoulder
and
another
page
shows
how
an
arm
works


the
notebooks
were
not
published
in
leonardo
lifetime


after
he
died
they
were
divided
between
different
people
who
had
known
him


they
are
nearly
all
in
museums
or
libraries
such
as
<collocation>windsor castle</collocation>
the
louvre
and
the
british
library


the
a
library
in
milan
has
the
codex


studies
some
of
the
things
that
leonardo
studied
are
the
geology
of
the
earth
with
its
mountains
valleys
rivers
and
rocks


the
anatomy
of
the
human
body
with
its
skeleton
muscles
veins
and
internal
organs


leonardo
was
given
dead
bodies
by
a
hospital


he
dissected
cut
up
thirty
dead
bodies
and
carefully
drew
many
of
the
parts


his
drawings
of
bones
and
muscles
were
to
help
other
artists
to
paint
the
human
body
properly


the
anatomy
of
horses
cows
dogs
and
bears


the
expressions
on
human
faces


the
flight
of
birds


the
weather
and
its
phenomena


the
way
that
water
flows


the
botany
of
plants


light
shadows
mirrors
and
lenses


perspective
and
the
way
to
make
things
look
near
or
far


the
geometry
of
solid
objects


he
drew
many
careful
pictures
which
were
used
by
the
mathematician
in
a
book
called
de


designs
and
inventions
many
of
the
drawings
and
notes
in
leonardo
notebooks
are
designs
plans
and
inventions


some
of
the
things
that
leonardo
designed
are
costumes
for
parades
carnivals
and
theater


these
were
probably
for
duke
court


they
include
armor
and
a
ferocious
dragon


war
machines
such
as
an
tank
an
enormous
cross
bow
and
a
horrible


none
of
these
things
were
ever
made
in
leonardo
lifetime


dams
and
canals
for
rivers


a
wooden
bridge
that
could
be
carried
flat
on
wagons
and
unfolded
and
put
together
at
the
river


flying
things
with
wings
that
flapped
a
helicopter
a
parachute
and
a
hang
glider


one
of
leonardo
servants
was
injured
trying
out
the
hang
glider


the
parachute
has
been
made
and
tested
in
modern
times
and
it
does
work


churches
and
castles


it
is
possible
that
the
castle
of
in
the
south
of
switzerland
was
designed
by
leonardo


no
other
building
that
he

was
