in
some
societies
dance
goes
with
song
as
well
as
music


people
who
want
to
learn
to
dance
can
go
to
dance
schools


it
may
take
years
of
practice
to
become
an
experienced
and
flexible
dancer


to
plan
a
dance
is
called
choreography
done
by
a
choreographer


often
this
goes
with
music
and
fits
into
a
certain
style


dances
may
be
planned
in
detail
or
they
may
be
whatever
dancers
feel
like
doing


however
most
dancing
does
follow
some
general
style
or
pattern


one
style
is
the
couple
dance
where
usually
a
man
and
a
woman
dance
together


other
dances
need
a
whole
group
of
people
together
to
make
it
work

chapter
divides
early
dances
into
dances
and
image
dances


by
dances
he
meant
dances
which
have
no
set
form
but
aim
at
getting
the
dancers
into
a
state
of
ecstasy


in
this
state
the
dancer
seem
changed
in
a
trance
and
are
often
thought
of
by
their
society
as
being
possessed
by
spirits


these
dances
are
done
on
certain
occasions
marriage
war
famine
illness
or
death
and
so
on


they
are
found
in
all
early
primitive
societies


the
image
dances
according
to
are
to
do
with
the
world
outside
the
dancer


by
imitating
an
animal
or
object
the
dancer
believes
he
can
capture
a
power
and
make
it
useful


to
dance
in
imitation
of
the
animal
which
is
going
to
be
hunted
is
to
become
one
with
them


to
imitate
the
act
of
sex
is
to
achieve
fertility


this
is
the
kind
of
thinking
behind
an
image
dance


points
out
that
societies
of
this
kind
do
not
really
understand
the
connection
between
cause
and
effect


they
really
believe
the
image
dances
work


the
dance
type
which
is
used
in
image
dances
is
mime


the
two
styles
of
dance
may
be
joined
together


fertility
dances
may
involve
both
<collocation>ecstatic states</collocation>
and

the
great
dancer
nijinsky
used
some
of
these
ideas
in
his
choreography
for
the
ballet

rite
of

about
the

more
recent
times
the

until
the
century
most
<collocation>ballroom dances</collocation>
were
sequence
dances


the
way
people
moved
was
planned
in
set
formation


these
formations
were
usually
lines
or
squares


everyone
moved
at
the
same
time
and
finished
at
the
same
time


the
music
played
for
a
set
time
and
then
stopped


after
the
invention
of
the
waltz
around
another
style
of
dancing
developed


in
the
waltz
and
later
dances
people
danced
in
couples
but
they
did
so
separately


they
did
not
dance
in

moved
round

pleased

once

monastery


people
think
this
could
be
abbey
after
it
was
ruined


the
dissolution
of
the
monasteries
was
an
event
that
happened
from
to
when
english
king
henry
took
away
the
land
and
money
that
the
nuns
and
monks
of
the
roman
catholic
church
owned


henry
then
gave
this
land
and
money
to
people
that
supported
him


this
was
also
when
henry
made
himself
the
new
head
of
the
church
of
england
which
is
a
type
of
christianity


it
all
started
when
henry
wanted
to
get
a
divorce
but
was
refused
by
the
pope


spoken

a
deadline
is
a
time
by
which
some
task
must
be
completed


very
often
it
means
a
time
limit
that
is
set
in
place
by
an
authority
for
example
a
teacher
tells
students
that
they
must
turn
in
their
homework
in
by
a
certain
time


this
is
so
the
teacher
is
able
to
report
fairly
to
his
or
her
principal
that
every
student
had
the
same
chance
to
do
the
work


deadlines
may
also
be
set
by
a
time
horizon
that
comes
from
something
that
is
not
a
human
authority
but
part
of
nature


for
example
by
sunset
one
must
do
those
tasks
requiring
daylight


however
a
human
must
watch
the
sun
and
decide
what
light
is
strong
enough
to
still
be
daylight
so
time
limits
will
still
be
involved
even
if
one
observes
a
horizon
and
sets
a
deadline
oneself


a
way
to
remember
this
is
that
a
time
horizon
is
like
the
physical
horizon
where
sunset
happens
and
a
time
limit
is
a
thing
people
set
up
to
deal
with
this


a
deadline
is
a
thing
powerful
people
set
up
to
ensure

powerful
people

is
a
language
written
by
john
garfield


the
idea
of
is
to
make
frequent
words
short
and
very
frequent
words
very
short


can
be
used
as
a
second
language
for
international
communications


is
also
a
shorthand
writing
system
this
means
you
can
use
it
to
write
quickly


the
method
was
made
up
by
john
garfield
in


it
was
first
published
in


it
was
called
international
symbolic
script


a
year
later
it
was
called


it
was
changed
in
and


it
has
two
uses
to
be
a
language
and
to
be
used
for
writing
quickly


hoped
that
this
would
mean
more
people
would
learn
it
because
they
could
use
it
for
two
reasons


the
books
that
wrote
about
are
not
printed
anymore


but
is
now
being
used
by
more
people
because
they
find
it
is
good
for
working
online


for
example
it
makes
it
faster
to
type
an
email


another
way
of
writing
quickly
is
pitman
shorthand


this
uses
special
symbols
instead
of
letters


uses
roman
letters


this
makes
it
easier
to
learn


it
also
means
it
can
be
typed
using
a
normal
keyboard


each
word
means
only
one
thing


this
means
you
do
not
need
to
use
different
forms
of
the
same
word


the
words
used
in
are
the
same
as
the
words
used
in
many
other
languages


the
words
are
like
short
versions
of
the

overview
of
by
richard
k
harrison


a
common
image
of
the
devil
red
with
horns
and
a
tail
in
some
religions
the
devil
is
a
bad
spirit
that
tries
to
create
problems
for
people


some
people
also
use
the
words
the
devil
or
satan
for
the
most
powerful
devil


the
word
devil
comes
from
the
greek
word
which
means
someone
who
tells
lies
to
hurt
you


is
translated
to
the
english
word
slanderer


the
new
testament
uses
as
a
title
for
satan
and
so
the
devil
became
another
name
for
satan
in
english


in
the
<collocation>old testament</collocation>
there
is
the
serpent
and
the
shaitan
who
may
be
two
different
characters


shaitan
in
hebrew
means
adversary
an
enemy
or
opponent


shaitan
is
also
the
word
used
for
the
devil
in
the
koran
who
often
appears
as
an
animal
and
tries
to
get
people
to
do
the
wrong
thing


in
christianity
the
devil
was
originally
an
angel
in
heaven
called
lucifer


but
he
wanted
to
be
the
ruler
of
heaven
and
so
he
revolted
against
god


after
a
hard
fight
he
was
defeated
and
thrown
out
of
heaven


some
other
angels
who
helped
him
were
also
thrown
out


after
the
devil
was
thrown
out
of
heaven
he
started
doing
bad
things
on
the
earth


he
wants
people
to
worship
him
instead
of
god


sometimes
he
tries
to
trick
people
by
giving
them
<collocation>false promises</collocation>


the
other
angels
who
were
thrown
out
of
heaven
became
evil
spirits
called
demons


they
obey
the
devil
and
help
him
do
evil
things


the
book
of
revelation
says
that
god
will
punish
the
devil
and
his
demons
by
throwing
them
into
a
lake
of
fire
that
burns
in
hell


this
will
happen
in
the
future


artists
draw
pictures
of
the
devil
that
show
him
as
ugly
and
evil


but
nobody
knows
what
he
may
look
like


usually
he
is
a
spirit
that
nobody
can
see
but
he
can
make
himself
look
like
a
real
person
in
order
to
trick
people


many
modern
depictions
of
the
devil
portray
him
as
a
red
being
with
horns
and
a
pointed
tail
carrying
a
<collocation>red pitchfork</collocation>


not
all
religions
believe
in
the
devil


for
example
buddhists
do
not
believe
in
the
devil


fact
date
october
many
satanists
believe
in
the
devil
or
satan
only
as
a
metaphor
not
an
actual

diarrhea
also
spelled
diarrhoea
happens
when
the
body
makes
more
watery
feces
than
normal


in
a
baby
it
is
the
most
common
symptom
of
malnutrition


this
means
not
eating
enough
or
well
enough


diarrhea
can
occur
in
humans
as
well
as
most
other
mammals


diarrhea
is
not
a
disease


it
is
a
condition
that
a
body
can
be
in


however
there
are
many
diseases
that
can
cause
your
body
to
have
diarrhea


most
are
temporary
and
related
to
diet
the
food
you
eat


food
safety
and
hand
washing
can
lower
the
risk
of
getting
diarrhea


stress
and
drinking
too
much
alcohol
or
caffeine
can
also
cause
diarrhea


in
developing
nations
malnutrition
is
a
common
cause
of
child
death


part
of
the
deaths
from
malnutrition
are
caused
by
diarrhea


another
way
diarrhea
can
kill
you
is
by
dehydration


because
diarrhea
is
watery
in
nature
it
takes
up
a
lot
of
the
water
in
your
body


diarrhea
is
often
treated
with
aspirin
or
glucose
these
reduce
pain
and
may
stop
some
symptoms
for
a
while


however
if
it
was
because
of
malnutrition
it
will
not
save
the
child
life


<collocation>spending money</collocation>
on
rehydrating
salts
clean
water
and
more
food
is
the
most
direct
way
to
<collocation>cure diarrhea</collocation>
from
malnutrition


the
opposite
of
diarrhea
<collocation>firm feces</collocation>
are
a
sign
of
good
digestive
health


many
people
adopt
vegetarian
diets
with
high
dietary
fiber
to
prevent
diarrhea
and
other
digestive
problems

a
diagram
of
the
first
four
<collocation>spatial dimensions</collocation>


dimensions
are
a
concept
from
mathematics
and
physics
one
way
to
define
a
dimension
is
to
look
at
the
degrees
of
freedom
a
movement
has
in
in
a
specific
space


there
are
different
concepts
where
the
term
dimension
is
used
and
there
are
also
different


there
is
no
definition
that
can
satisfy
all
concepts


in
a
vector
space
a
dimension
is
equal
to
the
of
the
<collocation>minimal generator</collocation>


it
is
also
equal
to
the
of
the
maximal
set
of
independent
vectors
of
that
space


normal
objects
in
everyday
life
are
specified
by
three
which
are
usually
called
length
width
and
depth


mathematicians
call
this
<collocation>concept euclidean</collocation>
space


dimensions
can
be
used
to
measure
position
too


the
distance
to
a
position
from
a
starting
place
can
be
measured
in
the
length
width
and
height
directions


these
distances
are
a
measure
of
the
position


sometimes
a
fourth
dimension
time
is
used
to
show
the
position
of
an
event
in
time
and
space


other
dimensions
in
modern
science
people
use
other
dimensions


dimensions
like
temperature
and
weight
can
be
used
to
show
the
position
of
something
in
less
simple
spaces


mathematicians
also
use
dimensions


in
mathematics
dimensions
are
more
general


dimensions
in
mathematics
might
not
measure
things
in
the
world


the
rules
for
doing
arithmetic
with
dimensions
in
mathematics
might
be
different
than
usual
arithmetic
rules


dimensions
and
<collocation>vectors vectors</collocation>
are
used
to
show
distances
and
directions


vectors
are
often
used
in
engineering
and
science
and
sometimes
in
mathematics


a
vector
is
a
list
of
numbers


there
is
one
number
for
each
dimension


there
are
arithmetic
rules
for
vectors


for
example
if
jane
wants
to
know
the
position
of
sally
sally
can
give
jane
a
vector
to
show
the
position


if
jane
and
sally
are
in
the
world
there
are
three
dimensions


therefore
sally
gives
jane
a
list
of
three
numbers
to
show
her
position


the
three
numbers
in
the
vector
sally
gives
jane
might
be
sally
distance
north
of
jane
sally
distance
east
of
jane
sally
height
above
jane


distance
is
how
far
one
thing
is
from
another
thing


distance
is
a
measure
of
the
space
between
two
things


examples
of
distance
one
ball
is
feet
from
another
ball


the
distance
between
the
two
balls
is
feet


john
walks
north
at
kilometres
per
hour
for
one
hour


john
walks
a
distance
of
kilometres


a
circle
is
a
curved
line


each
point
on
the
circle
is
the
same
distance
from
the
center
of
the
circle


displacement
distance
is
different
from
displacement


displacement
is
the
difference
between
a
starting
point
and
a
finishing
point


example
of
displacement
a
and
b
are
metre
apart


tom
walks
from
a
to
then
tom
walks
from
b
back
to
the
distance
tom
walked
is
metres


tom
displacement
is
metres
because
tom
started
at
a
and
finished
at


date
march
depth
in
mathematics
in
math
the
distance
between
the
nearest
end
and
farthest
end
of
an
object
is
its
depth


for
example
jane
measures
a
box


when
she
measures
the
distance
between
the
end
of
the
box
closest
to
her
and
the
end
of
the
box
farthest
away
jane
measures
the
box
depth

depth
in
liquids
for
liquids
the
distance
between
the
top
or
surface
of
the
liquid
and
the
bottom
of
the
liquid
is
the
liquid
depth


for
example
water
is
a
liquid


if
you
fill
a
container
with
water
the
distance
between
the
top
of
the
water
and
the
bottom
of

container
is
the
water
depth


if
the
depth
is
big
we
