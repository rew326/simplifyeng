the
secret
history
of
the
mongols
reports
that
was
born
with
a
<collocation>blood clot</collocation>
grasped
in
his
fist
a
sign
that
he
was
destined
to
become
a
great
leader


he
was
the
son
of
his
father
a
minor
tribal
chief
of
the
and
an
ally
of
khan
of
the
tribe
and
the
oldest
son
of
his
mother


according
to
the
secret
history
was
named
after
a
chieftain

his

family
of
blacksmiths


clan
was
called
and
was
from
the
the
of
the

like

they
were

be
artistic
interpretations


persian
historian
recorded
in
his
chronicles
that
the
legendary
glittering
ancestor
of
genghis
was
tall
and


also
described
the
first
meeting
of
genghis
and
khan
when
genghis
was
shocked
to
find
that
had
not
inherited
his
red
hair


also
according
to
genghis
clan
had
a
legend
involving
their
origins
it
began
as
the
result
of
an
affair
between
and
a
stranger
to
her
land
a
glittering
man
who
happened
to
have
red
hair
and
eyes


modern
historian
paul
has
suggested
in
his
genghis
biography
that
the
glittering
man
may
have
been
from
the
people
who
historically
displayed
these

characteristics

political
system
that
stalin
made


stalin
was
denounced
as
a
tyrant
however
after
outsmarting

defeating

rivals
established
