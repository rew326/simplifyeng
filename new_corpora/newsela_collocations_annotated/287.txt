because
psychology
is
difficult
to
study
as
a
whole
psychologists
often
only
look
at
small
parts
of
it
at
a
time


psychology
has
much
in
common
with
many
other
fields
and
overlaps
with
many
of
them


some
of
these
fields
are
medicine
computer
science
and
linguistics


in
this
field
a
professional
practitioner
or
researcher
is
called
a
psychologist
and
is
a
social
behavioural
or
cognitive
scientist


psychologists
attempt
to
understand
the
role
of
mental
functions
in
individual
and
social
behavior


they
also
explore
the
physiological
and
neurobiological
processes
which
cognitive
functions
and
behaviors

has
been
split
up
into
smaller
parts
called
branches


these
are
subjects
in
psychology
that
try
to
answer
a
particular
group
of
questions
about
how
people
think


some
branches
of
psychology
that
are
often
studied
are
cognitive
psychology
looks
at
how
people
think
use
language
remember
and
forget
and
solve
problems


perceptual
psychology
asks
questions
about
how
people
make
sense
of
what
they
see
and
hear
and
how
they
use
that
information
to
get
around


social
psychology
looks
into
how
groups
of
people
work
together
and
how
societies
build
and
work


<collocation>developmental psychology</collocation>
is
interested
in
how
people
develop
and
change
through
their
lives


this
includes
what
used
to
be
called

studies
how
evolution
may
have
shaped

people
think
and

things


looks
at
the
brain
and
how
it
works
to
make
people
the
way
they
are

to
work
out
what
differences
there
are
between
people
who
are
healthy
and

<collocation>clinical psychology</collocation>
is
about

to

geriatric
psychology

is
a
type
of
science
and
research
psychologists
use
many
of
the
same
types
of
methods
that
researchers
from
other
natural
and
social
sciences
use


psychologists
make
theories
to
try
to
explain
a
behavior
or
pattern
they
see


based
on
their
theory
they
make
some
predictions


they
then
carry
out
an
experiment
or
collect
other
types
of
information
that
will
tell
them
whether
their
predictions
were
right
or
wrong


some
types
of
experiments
can
not
be
done
on
people
because
the
process
would
be
too
long
expensive
dangerous
unfair
or
otherwise
unethical


there
are
also
other
ways
psychologists
study
the
mind
and
behavior
scientifically
and
test
their
theories


psychologists
might
wait
for
some
events
to
happen
on
their
own
they
might
look
at
patterns
among
existing
groups
of
people
in
natural
environments
or
they
might
do
experiments
on
animals
which
can
be
simpler
and
more
ethical
to
study


psychology
shares
other
things
with
natural
sciences
as
well


for
example
a
good
psychological
theory
may
be
possible
to
prove
wrong


just
like
in
any
natural
science
a
group
of
psychologists
can
never
be
completely
sure
that
their
theory
is
the
right
one


if
a
theory
can
be
proved
wrong
but
experiments
do
not
prove
it
wrong
then
it
is
more
likely
that
the
theory
is
accurate


this
is
called


psychologists
use
many
tools
as
part
of
their
daily
work


psychologists
use
surveys
to
ask
people
how
they
feel
and
what
they
think


they
may
use
special
devices
to
look
at
the
brain
and
to
see
what
it
is
doing


psychologists
use
computers
to
collect
data
as
they
measure
how
people
behave
in
response
to
pictures
words
symbols
or
other
stimuli


psychologists
also
use
statistics
to
help
them
analyze
the
data
that
they
get
from
their
experiments


symbolic
and
subjective
approaches
not
all
psychology
is
scientific
psychology


psychodynamic
psychology
and
depth
psychology
do
things
like
interpreting
people
dreams
to
understand
the
unconscious
mind
as
in
older
approaches
to
psychology
begun
by
freud
or
carl


<collocation>humanistic psychology</collocation>
and
existential
psychology
also
believe
that
it
is
more
important
to
understand
personal
meaning
than
to
find
causes
and
effects
of
mental
processes
and
behaviors


psychologists
psychologists
are
people
who
work
in
the
field
of
psychology


a
psychologist
may
work
in
either
basic
research
or
applied
research


basic
research
is
the
study
of
people
or
animals
to
learn
more
about
them


applied
research
is
using
what
was
learned
from
basic
research
to
solve
problems


if
he
or
she
is
qualified
as
a
<collocation>clinical psychologist</collocation>
they
may
be
a
therapist
or
counsellor
as
well
as
a
researcher


to
become
a
psychologist
a
person
must
first
get
a
basic
degree
at
a
university
and
then
go
to
graduate
school


a
master
degree
either
master
of
science
or
ma
master
of
arts
allows
beginning
work
like
a
school
psychologist


a
doctorate
degree
takes
a
longer
time
because
it
includes
doing
research
and
writing
a
detailed
report
called
a
dissertation


the
doctoral
graduate
uses
the
initials
or
doctor
of
philosophy
after
his
or
her
name


some
clinical
psychologists
earn
a
doctor
of
psychology
degree
and
use
the
initials
after
their
name


the
american
<collocation>psychological association</collocation>
says
that
people
need
a
or
and
a
current
state
license
in
the
in
order
to
call
themselves
a
psychologist


the
words
psychologist
and
psychiatrist
may
be
confused
with
each
other


a
psychiatrist
has
graduated
from
medical
school
and
uses
the
initials
md
or
its
equivalent
mb
in
london
university
for
example


a

may

history
chopsticks
came
from
china
as
early
as
the
dynasty


the
creation
of
chopsticks
might
have
been
influenced
by
the
teachings
of
confucius


they
were
widely
used
throughout
east
asia


tools
like
chopsticks
were
also
found
in
the
archaeological
site
in
israel


this
discovery
may
mean
there
was
some
form
of
trade
between
the
middle
east
and
asia
in
early
antiquity


alternatively
such
tools
may
have
developed
independently
in
both
the
middle
east
and
asia


chopsticks
were
also
common
household
items
of
civilized
on
the
mongolian
steppes
during
the
centuries

a
semantic
part
meaning
bamboo


in
chinese
the
old
word
for
chopsticks
and
also
in
some
varieties
of
modern
chinese
such
as
was
mc


however
became
a
taboo
on
ships
because
it
sounded
the
same
as
another
word
meaning
to
stop


consequently
it
was
replaced
by
a
word
of
opposite
meaning
fast
quick


this
gradually
spread
until
it
became
the
word
for
chopsticks
in
most
varieties
of
modern
chinese


the
character
for
this
new
meaning
of
chopsticks
for
has
the

problems
with
<collocation>chopsticks chopsticks</collocation>
and
the
environment
using
a
set
of
chopsticks
only
once
and
then
throwing
them
away
causes
problems
for
the
environment

some
movements

aim
at
telling
people
to
use
a
set
of
chopsticks
more
than
once


in
china
about
billion
pairs
of
<collocation>disposable chopsticks</collocation>

billion
cubic

fully

trees

is
the
biggest
producer
of
<collocation>disposable chopsticks</collocation>

chopsticks


if
production
continues
at
the
current
level
china
forests
will
be
gone
in
about
a
decade


for
this
reason
a
tax
has
been
introduced
on
chopsticks
that
are
only
used
once


there
are
also
moves
to
replace
<collocation>disposable chopsticks</collocation>
made
of

by
plastic
or
metal

chopsticks
and
health

getting
arthritis
in
the
hand


with
this
cartilage
gets
worn
off
which
causes
pain
in
the
joints
of
the
hand


this
is
more
common
in
older
people


another
problem
is
that
using
certain
kinds
of
chopsticks
may
lead
to
coughing
or
even
asthma


the
<collocation>hong kong</collocation>
department
of
health
did
a
