human
spirit
another
main
belief
is
that
humans
have
a
soul
or
spirit
which
lives
on
after
their
body
has
died


the
person
spirit
is
on
a
journey
through
life
that
continues
after
death


most
religions
believe
that
what
a
person
does
during
their
lifetime
will
affect
what
happens
to
their
spirit
in
the
afterlife


many
religions
teach
that
a
good
person
spirit
can
reach
a
special
place
of
peace
and
happiness
such
as
heaven
or
nirvana
and
that
a
bad
person
spirit
can
travel
to
a
place
of
pain
and
suffering
such
as
hell


still
other
religions
believe
in
reincarnation
that
instead
of
going
either
to
heaven
or
hell
spirits
of
the
dead
return
to
earth
in
a
new
body


morality
morals
are
the
way
a
human
behaves
to
other
humans


most
religions
make
rules
about
human
morals


the
rules
of
how
people
should
act
to
each
other
are
different
in
different
religions


for
some
religions
following
a
path
of
goodness
truth
and
duty
is
very
important


this
is
called
tao
in
china


in
the
teachings
of
judaism
people
were
told
to
love
your
neighbor
as
yourself


in
the
teachings
of
jesus
people
were
told
to
think
of
every
single
person
as
their
neighbor
and
treat
them
with
love


not
every
religion
teaches
people
to
be
kind
to
all
other
people


in
many
religions
it
has
been
common
for
people
to
believe
that
they
have
to
act
kindly
only
to
some
people
and
not
to
others


in
some
religions
people
believed
that
they
could
please
a
god
by
killing
or
sacrificing
another
person


traditions

is
teaching

about
his
religion
teaching
a
religion
is
passed
on
from
one
person
to
another
through
teachings
and
stories
which
are
often
called
myths
which
may
be
written
down
like
the
bible
or
told
from
memory
like
the
stories
of
australian
aboriginal
people


in

religions
there
are
people
who
take
the
role
of
priest
and
spend
their
lives
teaching
others
about
the
religion


there
are
also
people
who
take
the
role
of
pastor
and
spend
their
life
caring
for
other
people


a
person
may
be
both
a
priest
and
a
pastor


they
are
called
by
different
names
in
different
religions

it

it

witness
and
conversion
in
many
religions
it
is
thought
important
that
people
should
show
other
people
that
they
are
following
a
particular
religion


this
might
be
done
in
a
general
way
by
wearing
a
symbol
or
a
type
of
clothing


many
people
believe
that
it
is
important
to
tell
other
people
about
their
religion
so
that
they
can
believe
as
well


this
is
called
witnessing


these
sikhs
in
canada
wear
a
of
turban
or
head
scarf
as
a
symbol
and
witness
to
their
religion


there
are
many
ways
to
witness


a
young
person
might
simply
say
to
their
friends
i
do
not
use
drugs
or
get
drunk
because
of
my
religion


this
is
a
witness


a
person
may
tell
their
classmates
workmates
and
friends
about
their
beliefs


a
person
might
go
to
other
people
houses
and
talk
about
their
beliefs
or
invite
the
people
to
join
in
the
rituals
of
the
religion
such
as
going
to
church
or
to
a
religious
festival


a
person
might
have
printed
material
such
as
books
or
leaflets
that
they
give
to
other
people
to
read


a
person
might
travel
to
a
different
country
to
teach
to
work
in
a
health
service
or
to
help
people
in
some
other
way


people
who
do
this
are
called
missionaries


these
are
different
ways
that
people
witness
to
their
religion


when
a
person
hears
a
witness
and
decides
that
they
will
join
the
religion
this
is
called
a
conversion


usually
a
person
decides
to
join
a
religion
because
they
like
what
they
have
read
or
been
told
and
they
believe
that
they
are
hearing
the
truth


they
join
the
religion
because
they
choose


however
throughout
history
there
have
been
many
times
when
people
have
been
forced
to
join
a
religion
by
violence
and
threats


this
is
still
happening
today


in
most
countries
of
the
world
people
are
free
to
belong
to
whatever
religion
they
choose


this
is
generally
thought
of
as
a
basic
human
right


however
there
are
parts
of
the
world
where
it
is
illegal
against
the
law
to
witness
to
any
religion
except
the
one
accepted
by
the
government
of
the
country


people
who
belong
to
other
religions
may
be
threatened
put
in
jail
or
murdered

times
of
the

latin

was
the

of
the
ancient

its
capital
was
rome
and
its
empire
was
based
on
the
mediterranean


the
empire
dates
from
when
became
the
emperor


the
empire
was
the
third
stage
of
ancient
rome


rome
was
first
ruled
by
kings
then
by
the
roman
republic
then
by
an
emperor


many
modern
lands
were
once
part
of
the
roman
empire
including
britain
not
scotland
spain
portugal
france
italy
greece
turkey
germany
egypt
and
the
north
coast
of
africa


the
language
of
the
roman
empire
was
latin


the
western
part
of
the
roman
empire
continued
for
about
years
and
the
eastern
part
including
greece
and
turkey
continued
for
about
a
thousand
years
more


the
eastern
part
was
called
the
byzantine
empire
with
a
capital
at
constantinople


how
the
empire
was
run
in
order
to
control
their
large
empire
the
romans
developed
important
ideas
about
law
and
government


they
developed
the
best
army
in
the
world
at
that
time
and
ruled
by
force


they
had
fine
engineering
and
built
roads
cities
and
outstanding
buildings


the
empire
was
divided
into
provinces
each
with
a
governor
plus
civil
and
military
support


letters
both
official
and
private
would
constantly
go
to
and
from
rome


trade
was
most
important
for
rome
a
city
of
more
than
a

people
by

the
largest
city
in
the
world


they
needed
and
got
wheat
from
egypt
tin
from
britannia
grapes
from
gaul
and
so
on


in
return
the
romans
built
<collocation>provincial capitals</collocation>
into
fine
cities
protected
them
from
raids
by
barbarians
and
provided
education
and
career
opportunities
for
young
people
in
the
provinces
such
as
careers
in
the
roman
army


in
principle
emperors
had
absolute
control
and
could
do
as
they
pleased


in

they
faced
many
difficult
problems


they
had
a
staff
of
what
we
call
civil
servants
and
the
advice
of
the
roman
senate


the
emperor
had
to
decide
what
were
the
most
important
issues
facing
the
empire
and
what
should
be
done
about
them


most
of
them
tried
to
do
two
sorts
of
thing


one
was
to
do
things
to
improve
the
life
of
romans
in
peacetime


the
other
was
to
fight
and
defeat
rome
enemies


a
wealthy
empire
always
has
enemies


with
kings
and
emperors
a
big
problem
is
the
order
of
succession


who
follows
them
when
they
die


kings
were
sometimes
followed
by
their
eldest
son
if
he
was
capable
of
ruling


for
roman
emperors
more
often
it
would
be
an
adopted
son


it
worked
like
this


the
emperor
would
notice

a
regime
is
the
leader
and
other
people
who
run
a
government
of
a
sovereign
state


there
are
many
kinds
of
regimes


they
can
achieve
power
in
many
ways


depending
on
the
time
and
place
and
local
civics
like
the
electoral
system
they
can
lose
power
in
many
ways
too


the
most
common
way
for
a
regime
to
lose
power
was
a
coup
invasion
or
revolution
until
the
century


after
that
it
became
very
dangerous
and
difficult
to
use
these
methods


<collocation>peaceful regime</collocation>
change
is
usually
by
an
election
this
method
is
now
used
by
more
than
half
the
people
on
the
earth


it
is
called
<collocation>representative democracy</collocation>


<collocation>such regimes</collocation>
are
often
called
administration
to
make
it
clear
they
are
not
dictators
and
since
the
executive
branch
does
not
have
all
the
power
itself
it
may
share
it
with
a
<collocation>legislative branch</collocation>


also
the
<collocation>judicial branch</collocation>
is
separate


the
courts
are
not
usually
considered
part
of
the
regime


however
some
things
are
the
same
no
matter
how
the
regime
achieved
power
the
regime
needs
help
among
people
outside
the
regime
and
government
to
stay
in
power
these
may
be
in
the
military
or
a
political
party
