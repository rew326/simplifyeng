was

to
<collocation>treat syphilis</collocation>


the
problem
with
this
was
that
mercury

is
very
toxic


sometimes
the
symptoms
of

for
this
reason
has
recently
been

with
less
toxic
products


today
the
use
of
mercury
in
medicine
has
greatly
declined
in
all
respects
especially
in
developed
countries


thermometers
and
blood
pressure
devices
using
mercury
were
invented
in
the
early
and
late
centuries
respectively


now
their
use
is
declining
and
has
been
banned
in
some
countries
states
and
medical
institutions


in
the
senate
passed
legislation
to
phase
out
the
sale
of
<collocation>mercury thermometers</collocation>


in
washington
and
maine
became
the
first
states
to
ban

mercury
compounds
are
in
some
drugs
including
topical
antiseptics
stimulant

the
has
inadequate
data
to
establish

mercury
in

is
still

it

toxicity
mercury
is
liquid
at
room
temperature
and
fumes
of
mercury
are
very
poisonous


ingested
<collocation>elemental mercury</collocation>
is
less
dangerous


the
biggest
problems
are
organic
mercury
compounds
which
are
eaten
with
food


however
inorganic
compounds
such
as
mercury
ii
nitrate
are
also
highly
toxic
by
ingestion
eating
or
inhalation
breathing
in
of
the
dust


mercury
can
cause
both
chronic
and
<collocation>acute poisoning</collocation>


in
the
year
over
people
died
of
<collocation>mercury poisoning</collocation>
on
the
ship
triumph
because
a
barrel
of
mercury
had
leaked


mercury
is
extremely
poisonous
and
has
to
be
used
carefully


when
mercury
is
spilled
there
are
special
ways
to
clean
it
up


<collocation>smaller drops</collocation>
should
be
combined
to
a
larger
drop
on
hard
surfaces
to
be
removed
more
easily
for
example
being
pushed
into
a
bag
that
can
be
thrown
away


vacuum
cleaners
and
brooms
should
not
be
used


this
is
because
they
can
spread
mercury
even
more


afterwards
elements
such
as
sulfur
or
zinc
powder
should
be
sprinkled
over
the
place
then
collected
and
cleaned
away


it
is
not
easy
to
clean
mercury
entirely
off
clothing
so
it
is
better
not
to
use
them
anymore


breathing
in
mercury
vapor
is
also
very
dangerous

in

north

were
heavily
influenced
by
the

that
led
to
the
appearance
of
new

such
as
those
of

this
also
led
to
an

background
the
outbreak

was
due
to
the
different
ways
of
thinking
known
as
ideology
both
in
economy
and
government


the
united

used
capitalism
as
their
economic
system
while
the
soviet

used
socialism


both
countries
claimed
to
be
a
democracy
the

basically
a
two

state
and
the

was
a

these
differences

the

the

and
great
britain
still
did
not
agree
with
each

in
terms
of

but
both
thought
that
it
was
more
important
to
work
together
fighting

and

that

it
split
it
into
four
parts


one

was
given
to
the
<collocation>united kingdom</collocation>
one
part
to
france
one
part
to
the
united
states
and
the
eastern
part
was
occupied
by
the
ussr


the
city
of
berlin
was
also
partitioned
between
the
four
parties
even
though
it
was
located
in
the
part
occupied
by
the
ussr


subsequently
the
three
countries
combined
their
sections
of
the
country
to
form
a
country
known
as
the
federal
republic
of
germany
deutschland
or


the
ussr
named
their
section
of

the
cold

included
several
proxy
wars


in
some
third
world
civil
wars
the
united
states
and
the
soviet
union
supported
opposite
sides
with
arms
advisers
and
on
some
occasions
with
combat
troops


for
example
author
michael
lind
wrote
that
the
vietnam
war
was
a
proxy
war
between
the
united
states
the
soviet
union
and
china
which
was
also
a
communist
country


the
soviet
union
and
china
worked
together
to
help
north
vietnam
but
did
not
actually
fight
in
the
war


on
the
other
hand
the
united
states
fought
directly
on
the
side
of
the
south
against
north
vietnam


in
the
korean
war
the
opposing
great
powers
sent
arms
and
advisors
and
indeed
the
us
and
many
allies
sent
combat
troops
under

espionage
or
countries
spying
on
other
countries
was
a
great
part
of
the
cold
war


after
its
successes
in
the
manhattan
project
the
ussr
built
up
its
spy
organs
especially
the


the
central
<collocation>intelligence agency</collocation>
led
us
efforts
abroad
while
the
fbi
did
counterespionage


catching
foreign
spies
was
among
functions
as
well
as
fighting
domestic
subversion


allied
countries
on
both
sides
also
made
large
efforts
in
the
spy
war


in
the
ussr
the
dictator
joseph

died
and

took
his
place


khrushchev
<collocation>secret speech</collocation>
marked
a
period
of
and
khrushchev
tried
to
undo
many
of
the
things
stalin
did
such
as
the
<collocation>gulag prison</collocation>
camps
and
cult
of
personality


in
the
usa
this
was
the
period
of
the
<collocation>red scare</collocation>


americans
were
worried
that
if
communists
became
powerful
in
the
united
states
this
would
be
tantamount
to
handing
victory
to
the
russians


many
americans
were
accused
of
being
communists
especially
actors
artists
and
political
figures


<collocation>such accusations</collocation>
were
used
as
a
political
weapon
as
well
as
in
defense
of
country


many
actors
were
blackballed
and
were
not
hired
to
act
in
movies
ruining
their
careers


senator
joseph
accused
some
important
americans
of
being
communists
including
some
in
powerful
positions
in
the
government


this
activity
is
also
known
as
mccarthyism
and
is
looked
at
now
as
being
a
low
point
in
american
political
life
