an
auction
is
a
place
where
people
can
buy
or
sell
things


people
say
how
much
they
will
pay
for
something
and
the
person
who
is
willing
to
pay
the
most
gets
the
item


the
amount
people
will
pay
is
called
a
bid


the
person
in
charge
of
the
auction
is
the
auctioneer


he
or
she
usually
has
a
hammer
which
they
will
knock
when
a
bid
is
accepted


some
auctions
only
let
you
place
one
bid


some
let
you
change
your
bid
if
someone
else
bids
higher


there
is
also
another
kind
called
a
dutch
auction


in
a
dutch
auction
the
<collocation>auctioneer starts</collocation>
off
with
a
price
that
is
much
too
high
and
then
makes
it
lower
until
somebody
makes
a
bid


that
person
will
then
buy
the
item


recently
people
have
also
started
to
do
<collocation>auctions online</collocation>


the
most
popular
online
auction
place
is


a
common
prank
is
to
<collocation>fake bid</collocation>
where
a
person
bids
an
amount
and
they
do
not
actually
pay
it


this
usually
happens
when
people
bid
simply
to
force
others
to
bid
higher
forcing
them
to
lose
more
money
in
the
process


occasionally
the
fake
bidder
is
actually
the
highest
bidder
at
which
point
they
will
promptly
leave


although
generally
frowned
upon
fake
biding
is
not
thought
to
be
in
many
countries
however
legal
action
may
be
pursued
against
the
fake
bidder


advantages
of
<collocation>online auctions</collocation>
no
time
constraints
convenience
increment
bids
can
be
placed
at
any
time


no
geographical
constraints
sellers
and
bidders
can
participate
from
any
part
of
the
world
so
long
as
they
have
internet
access


this
reduces
the
costs
of
attending
an
auction


intensity
of
social
interaction
the
social
interaction
involved
in
bidding
is
very
similar
to
gambling


some
bid
primarily
to
play
the
game
rather
than
buy
the
products
or
services


large
number
of
bidders
due
to
the
relatively
low
price
the
broad
scope
of
products
and
services
available
the
ease
of
access
and
the
social
benefits


large
number
of
sellers
due
to
the
large
number
of
bidders
the
relatively

blitzkrieg
is
a
german
word
which
means
lightning
war
referring
to
the
high
velocity
of
a
lightning
bolt


in

move
very

with

often
the

units
might

fight
when
they
are

army
in

during
the
invasions
of
poland

the
blitz
refers
to
the
german
bombing
of
britain
especially
london
during
<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii
which
destroyed
over
a
million
homes
and
killed
over
people


the
bombing
was
supposed
to
quickly
destroy
industry
and
morale
happiness
and
make
it
easier
for
the
german
army
to
invade


towards

a
tank
is
an
<collocation>armored combat</collocation>
vehicle
typically
armed
with
a
large
cannon
and
a
few
machine
guns


the
first
tanks
were
used
by
the
british
during
<collocation>world war</collocation>
i
as
a
way
of
attacking
<collocation>enemy trenches</collocation>


they
were
called
tanks
to
trick
the
germans
into
thinking
they
were
water
carriers
for
areas
where
water
was
hard
to
move
or
find
in
large
amounts


a
tank
is
covered
in
thick
armor
to
protect
it
from
enemy
weapons


tanks
have
tracks
that
wrap
around
its
wheels
to
spread
out
its
weight
and
let
it
cross
rough
ground


most
tanks
have
a
powerful
gun
and
one
or
more
machine
guns


a
tank
crew
is
normally
men


a
driver
commander
and
gunner
are
always
present


there
may
also
be
a
loader
who
handles
the
ammunition
for
the
main
gun
so
the
gunner
does
have
to
take
his
eye
off
the
sights
and
lose
the
target


some
tanks
also
had
a
man
responsible
for
the
radio


tanks
became
a
main
weapon
during
<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii
where
battles
between
great
numbers
of
tanks
were
fought
especially
between
the
germans
and
the
soviet
union


<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii
tanks
were
the
german
panzer
iv
panther
and
tigers
soviet
produced
in
the
largest
numbers
of
any
tank
of
the
war
and
second
most
ever
british
matilda
churchill
and
cromwell
and
american
second
most
produced
tank
of
the
war
and
stuart
tanks


there
had
also
been
plans
for
very
big
and
more
heavily
<collocation>armored tanks</collocation>
but
these
were
deemed
to
be
of
little
use
due
to
their
huge
weight
which
would
have
made
moving
them
very
hard
and
due
to
their
size
which
would
had
made
them
easy
targets
for
heavy
artillery


old
tanks
are
often
modified
for
other
uses
like
carrying
soldiers
or
bridges


<collocation>combat engineers</collocation>
use
special
vehicles
for
example
minesweeper
tanks
or
tanks


the
tank
is
a
major
part
of
all
large
armies
today


tanks
have
replaced
cavalry
everywhere
and
do
the
things
that
horsemen
did
in
the
old
days


most
modern
tanks
are
of
the
heavy
or
main
battle
tank
type
able
to
fight
other
tanks


compared
to
older
types
are
very
heavy
russian
being
about
tonnes
and
western
around
with
a
mm
western
or
mm
russian
calibre
cannon
and
machine
guns


marines
and
other
specialized
forces
use

the
head
of
state
of
a
country
is
its
highest
leader


however
the
head
of
state
may
not
have
very
much
real
power


in
a
modern
republic
the
head
of
state
is
a
president
usually
elected
by
the
people
or
by
a
parliament


in
a
monarchy
the
head
of
state
is
the
king
or
queen


some
countries
have
different
systems
for
example
the
head
of
state
of
the
vatican
city
is
the
pope


in
a
modern
monarchy
the
head
of
state
usually
has
little
real
power


instead
the
most
powerful
person
is
the
head
of
government


this
is
usually
the
leader
of
the
political
party
that
wins
the
most
seats
in
an
election


in
these
cases
the
king
is
considered
to
be
the
leader
of
the
country
but
must
always
take
the
decisions
that
the
head
of
government
advises
them
to
make


the
king
or
queen
carries
out
national
ceremonies


the
<collocation>united kingdom</collocation>
works
like
this
with
the
<collocation>prime minister</collocation>
heading
the
government


a
president
may
be
the
most
powerful
person
in
the
country


this
is
true
in
the
united
states


however
sometimes
there
is
a
head
of
government
as
well
as
a
president


the
president
then
acts
very
much
like
a
king
or
queen
leaving
the
real
decisions
to
the
head
of
government


the
republic
of
ireland
works
like
this


in
older
times
and
in
some
modern
countries
the
head
of
state
has
absolute
power
this
called
an
<collocation>absolute monarchy</collocation>

biography
early
life
lenin
was
born
on
april
in
the
town
of
in
the
russian
empire


his
mother
was
a
schoolteacher
and
his
father
was
an
education
official
technically
his
father
job
made
him
and
his
family
noblemen


lenin
began
studying
politics
in
<collocation>high school</collocation>


lenin
was
good
in
school
and
learned
the
latin
and
greek
languages


in
he
was
thrown
out
of
state
university
because
he
protested
against
the
tsar
who
was
the
king
of
the
russian
empire


he
continued
to
read
books
and
study
ideas
by
himself
and
in
he
got
a
license
to
become
a
lawyer


in
the
same
year
that
lenin
was
expelled
from
university
his
brother
alexander
was
hanged
for
his
part
in
a
bomb
plot
to
kill
tsar
alexander
iii
and
their
sister
anna
was
sent
to


this
made
<collocation>lenin furious</collocation>
and
he
promised
to
get
revenge
for
his
brother
death


picture
taken
when
lenin
was
arrested
before
the
revolution
while
he
learned
about
law
in
petersburg
he
learned
about
the
writings
of
marx
and
who
were
both
philosophers
from
germany


marx
thoughts
were
called
marxism


to
talk
or
write
about
marxism
like
it
was
a
good
thing
was
illegal
in
russia
and
lenin
was
arrested
for
that
and
sent
to
prison
in
siberia


this
punishment
was
harsh
because
siberia
is
known
for
being
very
cold
and
isolated
and
almost
impossible
to
escape


in
july
when
he
was
still
in
siberia
lenin
married


in
he
wrote
a
book
he
called
the
development
of
capitalism
in
russia


in
lenin
was
set
free
from
prison
and
allowed
to
go
back
home


he
then
traveled
around
europe


he
began
to
publish
a
marxist
newspaper
called
the
russian
word
for
spark
or
lightning


he
also
became
an
important
member
of
the
russian
social
democratic
labor
party
or


in
lenin
had
a
major
argument
with
another
leader
of
the
party
julius
which
divided
the
party
in
two


lenin
wanted
a
strict
system
where
power
would
only
be
given
to
the
government


disagreed
and
wanted
the
government
to
give
power
to
ordinary
people


people
who
agreed
with
were
called
meaning
the
minority


the
people
who
agreed
with
lenin
were
called
bolsheviks
the
majority


in
he
traveled
around
europe
again
and
visited
many
socialist
meetings
and
events


during
<collocation>world war</collocation>
i
he
lived
in
big
european
cities
like
london
paris
and
geneva


at
the
beginning
of
the
war
a
big
meeting
called
the
second
international
included
the
bolsheviks


the
meeting
shut
down
when
a
lot
of
the
groups
argued
whether
or
not
to
support
the
war


lenin
and
the
bolsheviks
were
one
of
only
a
few
groups
who
were
against
the
war
because
of
their
marxist
ideas


after
tsar
nicholas
ii
gave
up
his
throne
during
the
february
revolution
lenin
went
back
to
russia
where
he
was
still
a
very
important
bolshevik
leader


he
wrote
that
he
wanted
a
revolution
by
ordinary
workers
to
overthrow
the
government
that
had
replaced
nicholas
ii


in
the
a
party
and
elements
of
the
secret
police
started
rumors
that
lenin
had
got
money
from
the
germans
because
he
had
traveled
through
germany
in
order
to
reach
russia


that
may
have
made
him
look
bad
because
a
lot
of
russians
had
died
fighting
germany
in
the
war


after
the
july
days
a
popular
uprising
in
which
was
crushed
by
the
provisional
government
he
left
russia
and
went
to
finland
where
he
could
hide
from
and
carry
on
with
his
work
on
communism


in
october
the
bolsheviks
led
by
lenin
and
headed
the
soviet
and
other
soviets
all
over
russia
in
a
revolution
against
government
which
was
known
as
the
october
revolution


they
won
and
announced
that
russia
was
a
socialist
country


in
november
lenin
was
chosen
as
its
leader


in
power
because
lenin
wanted
an
end
to
<collocation>world war</collocation>
i
in
russia
he
signed
the
treaty
of
with
germany
in
february


while
the
treaty
ended
the
attack
by
germany
russia
lost
a
lot
of
land
that
it
used
for
farming


the
treaty
also
made
germany
other
enemies
angry
and
together
with
russian
people
who
supported
the
tsar
or
government
they
attacked
russia


lenin
made
rules
that
as
much
food
as
possible
was
to
be
given
to
bolshevik
soldiers
in
russia
new
red
army


this
meant
that
they
won
the
war
but
ordinary
people
were
starving
and
many
died
of
hunger
or
disease


after
the
war
lenin
brought
in
the
new
<collocation>economic policy</collocation>
to
try
and
make
things
better
for
the
country
and
move
from
capitalism
towards
socialism


some
<collocation>private enterprise</collocation>
was
still
allowed
but
not
much
