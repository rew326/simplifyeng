back
to

in

later
maybe
in
a
new
rule
was
added
when
a
player
can
jump
he
must
jump


no
single
inventor
is
known
for
this
ancient
game
although
arthur

was
the
first
to
create
a

computer
game
in


<collocation>rules pieces</collocation>
when
game
starts
in
most
games
of
checkers
there
are
two
players


the
players
are
at
opposite
ends
of
the
board


one
player
has
dark
pieces
and
one
player
has
light
pieces


they
take
turns
moving
their
pieces


players
move
their
pieces
diagonally
from
one
square
to
another
square


when
a
player
jumps
over
their
opponent
the
other
player
piece
you
take
that
piece
from
the
board


english
checkers
most
english
speaking
people
call
english
checkers
draughts


english
checkers
is
played
on
an
chess
board


only
the
dark
squares
are
used
the
light
squares
are
never
used


for
that
reason
good
players
play
differently
in
the
left
and
right
corners


the
pieces
are
flat
and
round


they
are
referred
to
as
men


they
are
usually
colored
red
and
white


for
this
reason
the
darker
pieces
are
usually
called
red
and
the
lighter
pieces
are
always
called
white


some
checkers
sets
have
red
and
black
pieces


then
the
red
pieces
are
called
white
and
the
black
pieces
red


and
many
sets
simply
use
black
and
white
draughts


there
are
two
kinds
of
pieces
plain
single
pieces
and
kings


a
king
is
made
by
putting
one
plain
piece
on
top
of
another


each
player
starts
with
pieces
on
the
three
rows
closest
to
their
own
side


the
row
closest
to
each
player
is
called
the
king
row


the
darker
color
moves
first


how
to
move


a
player
can
move
in
two
ways


a
piece
can
be
moved
forward
diagonally
to
the
very
next
dark
square


in
some
variants
if
one
player
piece
the
other
player
piece
and
an
empty
square
are
lined
up
then
the
first
player
must
jump
the
other
player
piece


in
this
case
the
first
player
jumps
over
the
other
player
piece
onto
the
empty
square
and
takes
the
other
player
piece
off
the
board


however
this
is
an
uncommon
not
commonly
observed
in
the
americas


a
player
can
also
use
one
piece
to
make
multiple
jumps
in
any
one
single
turn
provided
each
jump
continues
to
lead
immediately
into
the
next
jump
and
in
a
straight
line


sometimes
a
player
may
have
the
option
or
a
choice
of
which
opponent
piece
he
must
jump


in
such
cases
he
may
then
choose
which
to
jump


if
you
keep
your
hand
on
any
piece
when
you
moving
you
have
the
choice
to
put
it
back
and
move
another
piece


if
a
player
piece
moves
into
the
king
row
on
the
other
player
side
it
becomes
a
king


it
can
move
forward
and
backward


regular
pieces
can
only
move
forward


a
king
can
not
jump
out
of
the
king
row
until
the
next
turn


unlike
regular
pieces
kings
can
jump
various
empty
boxes
at
a
time
to
capture
a
regular
piece


these
king
jumps
may
only
occur
in
diagonally
aligned
boxes


neither
kings
nor
regular
pieces
may
move
in
any
direction
that
is
not
diagonal


how
the
game
ends


the
first
player
to
lose
all
of
his
or
her
pieces
loses
the
game


if
no
players
are
able
to
move
the
player
with
the
most
amount
of
pieces
wins


if
the
players
have
the
same
amount
of
pieces
the
player
with
the
most
kings
wins


if
the
players
have
an
equal
number
of
pieces
and
the
same
number
of
kings
the
game
is
a
draw

henry

july
april
was
an
american
engineer
and
businessman


he
started
making
cars
in
and
founded
the
<collocation>ford motor</collocation>
company


he
developed
the
idea
of
a
system
in
which
each
worker
has
the
duty
to
do
one
small
part
of
the
process
of
making
something


his
idea
made
it
possible
to
produce
cars
in
large
numbers


this
was
called
the
assembly
line


this
is
still
a
very
popular
way
of
making
many
things
in
factories


it
was
quite
innovative
at
the
time
and
it
allowed
him
to
produce
many
cars
quickly
and
at
a
cheaper
price
than
other
car
companies
could


he
married
and
had
one
child
named
ford


ford
left

ford
said
that

this
meant

he
thought

be

to
buy
a
car
and
not

a

rich
people


in

this
goal
he

the
design
as
simple

all
his
cars
would
be
made

ford

up
