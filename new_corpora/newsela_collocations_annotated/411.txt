tobacco
is
a
plant
of
the
<collocation>nightshade family</collocation>
found
mainly
in
north
america
and

america


dried
tobacco
leaves
are
often
smoked
in
cigars
cigarettes
and
pipes
but
can
also
be
chewed
in
the
mouth
or
sniffed
in

tobacco
contains
a
very
powerful
addictive
chemical
called
nicotine
which
makes
it
very
hard
for
tobacco
users
to
stop
using
it


history
<collocation>native americans</collocation>
used
tobacco
before
europeans
arrived
in
america


these
europeans
learned
to
smoke
and
brought
it
back
to
europe
where
it
became
very
popular


at
that
time
tobacco
was
usually
smoked
in
a
pipe


the
europeans
who
moved
to
america
started
to
farm
tobacco
so
that
they
could
sell
it
in
europe


this
became
one
of
the
main
causes
of
the
african
slave
trade


in
a
european
man
called
john
arrived
in
the
american
state
of
virginia
and
set
up
a
tobacco
farm
which
made
him
very
rich


was
the
first
farmer
to
use
which
is
the
type
of
tobacco
most
commonly
smoked
today


he
also
married
a
native
american
woman
who
became
famous
when
she
went
to
live
in
london


in

that
people
have
lived
in
continuously


it

important
to
many

a

history
jerusalem
is
a
very
old
city


it
has
great
importance
for
three
religions
judaism
christianity
and
islam


the
bible
says
king
david
the
second
king
of
the
israel
took
this
city
from
pagans
and
settled
his
palace
there


king
solomon
david
son
and
the
next
king
built
the
temple
in
jerusalem


later
as
capital
of
judah
jerusalem
was
destroyed
by
nebuchadnezzar
ii
the
king
of
babylon


the
palace
of
king
david
and
the
temple
of
solomon
were
burned
and
the
jews
were
captured
and
taken
to
babylon


seventy
years
later
the
persian
king
cyrus
allowed
them
to
return
to
jerusalem
and
to
rebuild
the
temple


later
the
area
was
occupied
by
romans


king
the
great
who
ruled
for
the
roman
emperor
made
the
temple
larger
to
try
and
win
jewish
favor


the
temple
was
famous
for
its
greatness
and
beauty


<collocation>jesus christ</collocation>
died
in
jerusalem
around
ad


in
ad
the
jews
rebelled
against
the
romans
but
the
romans
destroyed
the
city
and
the
temple


jewish
people
who
lived
in
jerusalem
were
caught
and
became
slaves


the
romans
renamed
jerusalem
with
a
latin
name


since
then
the
temple
has
not
been
rebuilt
and
only
a
part
of
its
wall
remains
until
today


after
the
roman
empire
was
split
into
two
the
byzantine
empire
ruled
jerusalem


later
muslims
took
over
the
city
from
them


the
muslims
believed
muhammad
went
to
heaven
from
jerusalem


later
the
pope
in
rome
sent
the
crusaders
from
western
europe
to
try
and
take
it
back


they
succeeded
for
a
while
but
eventually
the
city
fell
again
to
the
saracens


until
the
century
jerusalem
was
a
part
of
the
ottoman
empire


there
were
some
jews
in
jerusalem
all
along
even
though
they
were
ruled
by
other
people

city
of
jerusalem

building
the
new
city
in

first
neighborhoods
in
the
new
city


in

the
end
of
the
first
war
jerusalem
was
divided
between
israel
and
jordan


israel

the
western
part
of
the
city


jordan
controlled
the
eastern
section
including
the
old
city
a
walled
section
of
jerusalem
dating
from
biblical
times


israel
took
control
of
the
entire
city
during
the
six
day
war
in


jerusalem
today
is
claimed
by
both
the
palestinians
and
the
israelis
as
their
capital


the
united

do
not
agree
to
israel
saying
that
jerusalem
is
the
capital
of
israel

history
a
long
time
ago
cornish
was
the
only
language
spoken
in
cornwall
but
more
and
more
people
began
to
speak
english
instead
of
cornish


in
when
the
prayer
book
was
written
in
english
instead
of
latin
the
cornish
people
got
angry
and
there
was
a
rebellion


because
many
cornish
speakers
died
and
because
they
would
now
hear
the
bible
in
english
the
language
was
used
less
and
less


by
there
were
only
a
few
people
who
could
speak
cornish
and
spoke
it
to
each
other
any
more


some
people
say
that
a
woman
called
dolly
was
the
last
person
who
could
speak
cornish


this
is
not
quite
true
but
she
was
one
of
the
last
people
to
use
it
instead
of
english


methods
of
spreading
some
people
learned
about
cornish
by
traveling
around
talking
to
people
who
could
still
speak
it
and
by
reading
old
plays
and
books


some
people
wanted
to
learn
the
language
and
speak
it
so
in
a
learned
man
called
henry
wrote
a
book
to
help
people


after
this
some
people
began
to
learn
the
language
and
speak
it
again


modern
day
no
one
knows
how
many
cornish
speakers
there
are
now


people
think
there
are
probably
about
to
people
who
speak
cornish


some
young
people
have
grown
up
speaking
it


many
other
people
in
cornwall
know
a
few
sentences
or
words
in
cornish


in
a
<collocation>hundred years</collocation>
the
cornish
language
has
grown
from
almost
no
speakers
to
many
thousands
which
is
very
exciting
for
many
people


there
are
now
many
new
books
films
and
songs
in
cornish


the
bible
has
now
been
translated
into
cornish


there
is
an
event
called
the
open
where
there
is
a
story
and
poetry
competition


sometimes
cornish
is
used
in
churches


there
used
to
be
a
problem
with
cornish
in
that
there
were
three
different
dictionaries
with
different
spellings
and
people
did
not
agree
about
how
to
write
the
words
or
how
to
say
them


this
was
confusing
for
people
when
they
have
not
been
speaking
long
so
in
people
who
used
the
different
types
of
cornish
came
together
and
agreed
on
a
new
standard
form
of
cornish
to
be
used
everywhere
