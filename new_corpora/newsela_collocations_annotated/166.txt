are
enzymes
that
cut
or
often
in
specific
place
in
the
molecule


enzymes
are
not
only
for
breaking
large
chemicals
into
smaller
chemicals


other
enzymes
take
smaller
chemicals
and
build
them
up
into
bigger
chemicals
and
do
many
other
chemical
tasks


the
classification
below
lists
the
main
types


biochemists
often
draw
a
picture
of
an
enzyme
to
use
as
a
visual
aid
or
map
of
the
enzyme


this
is
hard
to
do
because
there
may
be
hundreds
or
thousands
of
atoms
in
an
enzyme


biochemists
can
not
draw
all
this
detail


instead
they
use
<collocation>ribbon models</collocation>
as
pictures
of
enzymes


<collocation>ribbon models</collocation>
can
show
the
shape
of
an
enzyme
without
having
to
draw
every
atom


most
enzymes
will
not
work
unless
the
temperature
and
ph
are
just
right


in
mammals
the
right
temperature
is
usually
about
o
c
degrees
body
temperature


the
correct
ph
can
vary
greatly


pepsin
is
an
example
of
an
enzyme
that
works
best
when
ph
is
about


heating
an
enzyme
above
a
certain
temperature
will
destroy
the
enzyme
permanently


it
will
be
broken
down
by
protease
and
the
chemicals
will
be
used
again


some
chemicals
can
help
an
enzyme
do
its
job
even
better


these
are
called


sometimes
a
chemical
can
slow
down
an
enzyme
or
even
make
the
enzyme
not
work
at
all


these
are
called
inhibitors


most
drugs
are
chemicals
that
either
speed
up
or
slow
down
some
enzyme
in
the
human
body


lock
and
key
model
enzymes
are
very
specific
and
it
was
suggested
by
in
that
this
was
because
both
the
enzyme
and
the
substrate
possess
<collocation>specific complementary</collocation>
geometric
shapes
that
fit
exactly
into
one
another


this
is
often
referred
to
as
the
lock
and
key
model


however
this
model
fails
to
explain
what
happens
next


diagrams
to
show
the
induced
fit
hypothesis
of
enzyme
action
in
daniel
suggested
a
modification
to
the
lock
and
key
model


since
enzymes
are
rather
flexible
structures
the
active
site
is
reshaped
by
interactions
with
the
substrate


as
a
result
the
substrate
does
not
simply
bind
to
a
rigid
active
site


the
amino
acid
of
the
active
site
are
bent
into
positions
so
the
enzyme
does
its
catalytic
work


in
some
cases
such
as
the
substrate
molecule
also
changes
shape
slightly
as
it
enters
the
active
site

the
general
equation
for
an
enzyme
reaction
is

<collocation>enzyme enzymes</collocation>
lower
the
activation
energy
of
a
reaction
by
forming
an
<collocation>intermediary complex</collocation>
with
the
substrate


this
complex
is
called
an
complex


an
example
times
the
size
of
its
substrate
sucrose
splits
the
sucrose
into
its
<collocation>constituent sugars</collocation>
which
are
glucose
and
fructose


the
bends
the
sucrose
and
strains
the
bond
between
the
glucose
and
fructose


water
molecules
join
in
and
make
the
cleavage
in
a
fraction
of
a
second


enzymes
have
these
key
features
they
are
catalytic


they
commonly
increase
the
rate
of
reaction
billion
fold


the
enzyme
itself
is
not
changed
by
the
reaction


they
are
effective
in
tiny
amounts


one
enzyme
molecule
may
convert
molecules
of
substrate
a
minute
and
some
are
known
to
convert
million
in
a
minute


they
are
highly
specific


one
enzyme
will
only
carry
out
one
of
the
many
reactions
of
which
a
substrate
is
capable


control
of
enzyme
activity
there
are
five
main
ways
that
enzyme
activity
is
controlled
in
the
cell


enzyme
production
transcription
and
translation
of
enzyme
genes
can
be
increased
or
reduced
in
response
to
changes
in
the
cell
environment


this
form
of
<collocation>gene regulation</collocation>
is
called
<collocation>enzyme induction</collocation>
and
inhibition


for
example
in
bacteria
which
are
resistant
to
antibiotics
such
as
penicillin
enzymes
are
induced
which
the
<collocation>penicillin molecule</collocation>


enzymes
can
occur
in
different
cellular
compartments


for
example
<collocation>fatty acids</collocation>
are
synthesized
by
one
set
of
enzymes
in
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
and
apparatus


then
they
are
used
by
a
different
set
of
enzymes
as
a
source
of
energy
in
the
mitochondria


enzymes
can
be
regulated
by
their
own
products


for
example
the
end
product
often
inhibit
one
of
the
first
enzymes
of
the
pathway


such
a
regulatory
mechanism
is
called
<collocation>negative feedback</collocation>
because
the
amount
of
the
end
product
produced
is
regulated
by
its
own
concentration


this
prevents
the
cells
making
too
much
enzyme


the
control
of
enzyme
action
helps
keep
a
stable
internal
environment
in
living
organisms


enzymes
can
be
regulated
by
being
modified
after
their
production


an
example
is
the
cleavage
of
the
chain


a
digestive
protease
is
produced
in
inactive
form
in
the
pancreas
and
transported
in
this
form
to
the
stomach
where
it
is
activated


this
stops
the
enzyme
from
digesting
the
pancreas
or
other
tissues
before
it
enters
the
gut


this
type
of
inactive
precursor
to
an
enzyme
is
known
as
a


some
enzymes
may
become
activated
when
they
move
to
a
different
environment
from
high
ph
to
low
ph


for
example
in
the
<collocation>influenza virus</collocation>
is
activated
by
a
change
in
shape


this
is
caused
by
the
acidic
conditions
which
occur
inside
the
host
cell


or
are
helper
molecules
which
are
needed
to
make
an
enzyme
work


they
are
not
proteins
and
may
be
organic
or
inorganic
molecules


both
types
of
molecules
sometimes
contain
a
metal
ion
at
the
center
such
as
mg
cu
mn
or
iron
<collocation>sulphur clusters</collocation>


this
is
because
such
ions
may
act
as
<collocation>electron donors</collocation>
and
this
is
important
in
many
reactions


the
need
of
enzymes
for
various
little
helpers
is
the
basic
reason
why
animals
including
ourselves
need
trace
elements
and
vitamins


<collocation>classification enzymes</collocation>
have
been
classified
by
the
international
union
of
biochemistry


their
commission
on
enzymes
has
grouped
all
known
enzymes
into
six
classes
transfer
of
electron

from
one
molecule
to

a
mountain
is
a
natural
rise
of
the
earth
surface
that
usually
has
a
summit
or
top


it
is
usually
steeper
and
taller
than
a
hill


mountains
are
often
thought
of
as
being
a
hill
of
over
metres
about
feet
but
this
thought
is
not
the
same
in
every
country


mountains
are
important
to
life
on
earth
because
most
rivers
begin
in
mountains
and
carry
water
from
the
mountains
down
to
the
sea

volcanic
mountains
volcanic
mountains
are
mountains
that
form
when
molten
rock
erupts
onto
the
earth
surface


they
can
either
form
on
land
or
in
the
ocean


the
cascade
range
in
washington
oregon
and
northern
california
is
made
of
volcanoes


some
of
the
largest
volcanoes
are
on
divergent
boundaries
which
form
the
ridges


the
ridges
have
big
volcanic
mountain
chains
that
run
through
the
atlantic
pacific
and
indian
oceans


the
mountains
in
the
ridges
can
actually
grow
tall
enough
to
create
islands
such
as
iceland
or
the
azores


other
volcanic
mountains
can
form
over
hot
spots
which
are
pockets
of
magma
beneath
the
crust
that
erupt
onto
earth
surface


the
hawaiian
islands
are
actually
the
tops
of
really
high
volcanic
islands
that
have
formed
over
a
hot
spot
on
the

floor


the
main

island
is
actually
a
volcano
that
is
about
km

mountains
like
those
in
the
black
hills
of
south
dakota
and
the
mountains
of
<collocation>new york</collocation>
are
an
unusual
type
of
mountain
that
is
formed
when
molten
rock
rises
through
the
crust
and
push
up
the
rock
layers
above
it


this
creates
a
circular
dome
on
the
earth
surface


the
molten
rock
later
cools
off
and
forms
hardened
rock


when
the
pushed
up
rocks
are
worn
away
the
hardened
rock
is
shown


this
hardened
rock
then
wears

in
places


when
it
wears
away
it
leaves
mountains
and
they
are
called
dome
mountains


folded

folded
mountains
make
up
some
of
the
highest
mountains
in

folded
mountains
commonly
form

also
formed
when
two

rise

the
<collocation>newer processor</collocation>


processors
that
are
similar
will
sometimes
act
different


this
is
rarely
a
problem


many
systems
may
also
be
different
in
other
ways


their
access
to
the
memory
or
its
arrangement
may
be
different


computer
hardware
may
be
connected
in
a
different
way


also
the
access
to
other
hardware
could
be
changed


a
program
normally
relies
on
such
factors


for
this
reason
different
systems
will
typically
not
run
the
same
machine
code


this
is
true
even
when
the
same
type
of
processor
is
used


most
instructions
have
one
or
more
fields


they
specify
the
basic
instruction
type


other
fields
may
give
the
type
of
the
the
addressing
mode
and
so
on


there
may
also
be
special
instructions


they
are
contained
in
the
itself


these
instructions
are
called


<collocation>processor designs</collocation>
can
be
different
in
other
ways


different
instructions
can
have
different
lengths


also
they
can
have
the
same
length


having
all
instructions
have
the
same
length
can
simplify
the
design
