the
platypus
does
not
have
nipples
but
milk
comes
through
small
openings
in
the
skin


the
young
platypus
drinks
the
milk
from
the
mother
skin
while
she
lies
on
her
back


at
six
weeks
the
babies
have
fur
and
are
able
to
leave
the
burrow
for
short
trips


after
four
months
they
no
longer
need
their
mother
milk


the
long
period
as
dependent
young
the
provision
of
milk
and
the
way
the
young
learn
through
play
are
all
advanced
features
and
the
share
them
with
all
other
mammals


the
are
a
mixture
of
primitive
and
advanced
traits
a
situation
known
as
mosaic
evolution


where
platypus
live
the
platypus
lives
in
small
streams
and
rivers
over
a
large
area
of
eastern
australia


the
map
above
shows
this
with
dark
purple


it
has
been
seen
in
alpine
lakes
in
in
the
south
and
north
in
as
far
as
the
cape
york
peninsula
in
tropical
rain
forest
rivers


in
the
past
lived
in
south
australia
but
they
no
longer
live
there


there
are
platypus
on
kangaroo
island
but
these
were
brought
to
the
island
in
an
attempt
to
save
animals
people
thought
might
become
extinct


there
are
very
few
if
any
left
in
most
the
basin


the
water
there
is
no
good
because
people
used
it
to
grow
plants
and
cleared
the
trees
from
the
land


it
is
strange
that
the
platypus
does
not
live
in
some
healthy
rivers


it
does
live
in
some
less
healthy
coastal
rivers
for
example
the
river
in
victoria


platypus
are
difficult
to
see
in
the
wild


they
dislike
areas
with
people
spend
most
of
their
time
underground
or
under
water
and
sleep
during
the
day


at
national
park
in
there
are
spots
on
the
river
with
viewing
areas
where
wild
platypus
can
usually
be
seen
each
evening


the
past
and
the
future
platypus
picture
the
first
<collocation>platypus specimen</collocation>
arrived
in
england
in


they
sent
the
skin
of
a
dead
platypus
so
biologists
could
study
it


at
first
the
scientists
thought
the
skin
was
a
joke
because
they
thought
no
animal
could
look
so
strange


they
thought
an
asian
had
made
it
from
pieces
of
different
animals


national
geographic
magazine
had
a
story
on
the
platypus
in


many
people
all
over
the
world
had
never
heard
of
the
platypus


the
story
told
how
hard
it
is
to
raise
platypus
babies
in
zoos


raising
is
helping
little
babies
to
grow


even
today
humans
have
raised
only
few
platypus


david
at
the
sanctuary
in
victoria
had
the
first
successful
zoo
raised
platypus
in


he
nearly
did
it
again
in
at
the
david
wildlife
park
at
heads
but
it
died
at
days


raised
another
in
and
again
in


zoo
in
sydney
bred
twins
in
and
had
another
birth
in


the
platypus
will
probably
not
die
out
completely
in
the
near
future


say
that
it
is
secure
but
faces
future
threat
safe
now
but
not
in
the
future
or
common
but
vulnerable
there
are
a
lot
now
but
they
are
not
safe


they
say
this
because
people
can
make
the
water
unsafe
for
the
platypus

land
and
animals
kenya
is
a
country
of
grassland
but
it
is
not
rich
productive
land


this
is
a
very
dry
grassland
with
poor
soil


kenya
also
has
very
few
mineral
resources


of
the
country
is
covered
with
plains


they
are
low
in
altitude
along
the
coast
but
get
higher
further
inland
making
a
large
plateau


the
part
east
of
lake
is
the
only
true
desert
but
the
rest
can
be
very
close
to
desert


savannas
usually
get
between
and
inches
to
mm
of
rain
in
a
year


these
lands
however
are
called
savanna
because
of
the
type
of
plants
that
live
there
and
how
they
get
their
rain


savannas
have
a
wet
and
dry
season


during
the
wet
season
it
can
rain
hard
for
long
periods
of
time
then
not
rain
at
all
in
the
dry
season


savannas
that
have
more
rain
often
have
many
trees
spaced
out
across
their
plains


these
trees
have
deep
roots
or
store
water
like
desert
plants
do
to
live
through
the
long
dry
seasons
without
rain


even
drier
savannas
will
have
only
grass
and
that
too
only
in
a
few
clumps


the
dry
land
is
very
bad
for
crops
but
it
is
a
wonderful
place
for
all
kinds
of
wild
animals
to
gather
and
stay


that
is
why
kenya
has
a
lot
of
parks
where
the
animals
are
kept
and
protected
from
all
the
hunters


come
from
all
over
the
world
to
go
on
photo
safaris
in
kenya
special
wildlife
parks


the
people
come
to
kenya
on
safari
to
see
animals
such
as
the
rhinoceros
giraffe
wildebeest
elephant
cheetah
antelope
and
lion


these
animals
live
on
the
savanna
grasslands


the
wild
herbivores
move
as
they
eat
and
they
never
stay
in
one
spot
because
there
is
not
enough
grass
for
all
of
them


people
also
usually
raise
cattle
on
the
savanna


these
animals
are
kept
in
one
place
and
often
eat
up
all
the
grass
there


government
since
the
independence
of
kenya
in
kenya
has
usually
had
a
government
and
has
been
a
member
of
the
british
commonwealth


the
people
are
like
the
congo
divided
into
many
tribes
that
often
fight


however
kenya
government
is
trying
to
get
the
people
to
work
together
and
has
encouraged
them
to
run
businesses
