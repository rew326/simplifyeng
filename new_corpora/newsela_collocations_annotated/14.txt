most
of
the
technologies
used
to
build
computers
have
changed
since
the
but
many
current
computers
still
use
the
architecture


microprocessors
are
miniaturized
devices
that
often
implement
stored
program


in
the
computers
were
built
out
of
mostly
vacuum
tubes


transistors
replaced
vacuum
tubes
in
the
because
they
were
smaller
and
cheaper


they
also
need
less
power
and
do
not
break
down
as
much
as
vacuum
tubes


in
the
technologies
were
based
on
<collocation>integrated circuits</collocation>


microprocessors
such
as
the
intel
made
computers
smaller
and
cheaper


they
also
made
computers
faster
and
more
reliable


by
the
computers
became
small
and
cheap
enough
to
replace
mechanical
controls
in
things
like
washing
machines


the
also
saw
home
computers
and
personal
computer


with
the
evolution
of
the
internet
personal
computers
are
becoming
as
common
as
the
television
and
the
telephone
in
the
household


in
started
to
call
some
of
its
<collocation>mobile phones</collocation>
the
multimedia
computers
and
after
the
launch
of
the
apple
in
many
are
now
starting
to
add
the
category
among
real
computers


in
if
the
category
of
are
included
in
the
numbers
of
computers
in
the
world
the
biggest
computer
maker
by
units
sold
is
no
longer
but
rather


fact
date
december
kinds
of
computers
there
are
six
types
of
computers
personal
computers
mainframes
<collocation>laptop computers</collocation>
<collocation>mini computers</collocation>
super
computers
and
embedded
computers


a
desktop
computer
is
a
small
machine
that
has
a
screen
which
is
not
part
of
the
computer


most
people
keep
them
on
top
of
a
desk
which
is
why
they
are
called
desktop
computers


<collocation>laptop computers</collocation>
are
computers
small
enough
to
fit
on
your
lap


this
makes
them
easy
to
carry
around


both
laptops
and
are
called
personal
computers
because
one
person
at
a
time
uses
them
for
things
like
playing
music
surfing
the
web
or
playing
video
games


there
are
bigger
computers
that
many
people
at
a
time
can
use


these
are
called
mainframes
and
these
computers
do
all
the
things
that
make
things
like
the
internet
work


you
can
think
of
a
personal
computer
like
this
the
personal
computer
is
like
your
skin
you
can
see
it
other
people
can
see
it
and
through
your
skin
you
feel
wind
water
air
and
the
rest
of
the
world


a
mainframe
is
more
like
your
internal
organs
you
hopefully
never
see
them
and
you
barely
even
think
about
them
but
if
they
suddenly
went
missing
you
would
have
some
very
big
problems


there
is
another
type
of
computer
called
an
embedded
computer


an
embedded
computer
is
a
computer
that
does
one
thing
and
one
thing
only
and
usually
does
it
very
well


for
example
an
<collocation>alarm clock</collocation>
is
a
embedded
computer
it
tells
the
time


unlike
your
personal
computer
you
can
not
use
your
clock
to
play


because
of
this
we
say
that
embedded
computers
can
not
be
programmed
because
you
can
not
install
programs
like
on
your
clock


some
<collocation>mobile phones</collocation>
automatic
teller
machines
microwave
ovens
cd
players
and
cars
are
examples
of
embedded
computers


pc
computers
are
desktop
computers
that
have
the
cpu
and
speaker
in
the
same
case
as
the
monitor


apple
has
made
several
popular
examples
of
computers
such
as
the
original
macintosh
of
the
and
the
of
the
late
and


common
uses
of
home
computers
playing
computer
game
writing
solving
mathematics
looking
for
things
on
the
internet
watching
tv
and
movies
listening
to
music
communicating
with
other
people
downloading
sending
sorting
recording
calculating
editing
taking
pictures
photography
drawing
working
methods
computers
store
data
and
the
instructions
telling
them
what
to
do
with
the
data
as
numbers
because
computers
can
do
things
with
numbers
very
quickly


these
data
are
stored
as
binary
symbols
and


a
or
a
symbol
stored
by
a
computer
is
called
a
bit
which
comes
from
the
words
<collocation>binary digit</collocation>


computers
can
use
many
bits
together
to
represent
instructions
and
the
data
that
these
instructions
use


a
list
of
instructions
is
called
a
program
and
is
stored
on
the
computer
hard
disk


computers
work
through
the
program
by
using
a
central
processing
unit
and
they
use
fast
memory
called
ram
as
a
space
to
store
the
instructions
and
data
while
they
are
doing
this


when
the
computer
wants
to
store
the
results
of
the
program
for
later
it
uses
the
hard
disk
because
things
stored
on
a
hard
disk
can
still
be
remembered
after
the
computer
is
turned
off


an
operating
system
tells
the
computer
how
to
understand
what
jobs
it
has
to
do
how
to
do
these
jobs
and
how
to
tell
people
the
results


it
tells
the
electronics
inside
the
computer
or
hardware
how
to
work
to
get
the
results
it
needs


this
lets
most
computers
have
the
same
operating
system
or
list
of
orders
to
tell
it
how
to
talk
to
the
user
while
each
computer
can
have
its
own
computer
programs
or
list
of
jobs
to
do
what
its
user
needs


having
different
programs
and
<collocation>operating systems</collocation>
makes
it
easy
to
learn
how
to
use
computers
for
new
things


when
a
user
needs
to
use
a
computer
for
something
different
the
user
can
learn
how
to
use
a
new
program


the
internet
one
of
the
most
important
jobs
that
computers
do
for
people
is
helping
with
communication


communication
is
how
people
share
information


computers
have
helped
people
move
forward
in
science
medicine
business
and
learning
because
they
let
experts
from
anywhere
in
the
world
work
with
each
other
and
share
information


they
also
let
other
people
communicate
with
each
other
do
their
jobs
almost
anywhere
learn
about
almost
anything
or
share
their
opinions
with
each
other


the
internet
is
the
thing
that
lets
people
communicate
between
their
computers


computers
and
waste
a
computer
is
now
almost
always
an
electronic
device


it
usually
contains
materials
that
will
become
toxic
waste
when
disposed
of


when
a
new
computer
is
bought
in
some
places
laws
require
that
the
cost
of
its
waste
management
must
also
be
paid
for


this
is
called
product
stewardship


computers
can
become
obsolete
quickly
depending
on
what
programs
the
user
runs


very
often
they
are
thrown
away
within
two
or
three
years
because
newer
programs
require
a
more
powerful
computer


this
makes
the
problem
worse
so
computer
recycling
happens
a
lot


many
projects
try
to
send
working
computers
to
developing
nations
so
they
can
be
and
will
not
become
waste
as
quickly
as
most
people
do
not
need
to
run
new
programs


some
computer
parts
such
as
hard
drives
can
break
easily


when
these
parts
end
up
in
the
landfill
they
can
put
poisonous
chemicals
like
lead
into
the
ground
water


hard
drives
can
also
contain
secret
information
like
<collocation>credit card</collocation>
numbers


if
the
hard
drive
is
not
erased
before
being
thrown
away
an
<collocation>identity thief</collocation>
can
get
the
information
off
of
the
hard
drive
even
if
the
drive
does
work
and
use
it
to
steal
money
from
the
previous
owner
bank
account


main
hardware
computers
come
in
different
forms
but
most
of
them
have
a
common
design


all
computers
have
a
cpu


all
computers
have
some
kind
of
data
bus
which
lets
them
get
inputs
or
output
things
to
the
environment


all
computers
have
some
form
of
memory


these
are
usually
chips
<collocation>integrated circuits</collocation>
which
can
hold
information


many
computers
have
some
kind
of
sensors
which
lets
them
get
input
from
their
environment


many
computers
have
some
kind
of
display
device
which
lets
them
show
output


they
may
also
have
other
<collocation>peripheral devices</collocation>
connected


a
computer
has
several
main
parts


when
comparing
a
computer
to
a
human
body
the
cpu
is
like
a
brain


it
does
most
of
the
thinking
and
tells
the
rest
of
the
computer
how
to
work


the
cpu
is
on
the
motherboard
which
is
like
the
skeleton


it
provides
the
basis
for
where
the
other
parts
go
and
carries
the
nerves
that
connect
them
to
each
other
and
the
cpu


the
motherboard
is
connected
to
a
power
supply
which
provides
electricity
to
the
entire
computer


the
various
drives
cd
drive
<collocation>floppy drive</collocation>
and
on
many
newer
computers
<collocation>flash drive</collocation>
act
like
eyes
ears
and
fingers
and
allow
the
computer
to
read
different
types
of
storage
in
the
same
way
that
a
human
can
read
different
types
of
books


the
hard
drive
is
like
a
human
memory
and
keeps
track
of
all
the
data
stored
on
the
computer


most
computers
have
a
sound
card
or
another
method
of
making
sound
which
is
like
vocal
cords
or
a
voice
box


connected
to
the
sound
card
are
speakers
which
are
like
a
mouth
and
are
where
the
sound
comes
out


computers
might
also
have
a
graphics
card
which
helps
the
computer
to
create
<collocation>visual effects</collocation>
such
as
environments
or
more
realistic
colors
and
more
powerful
graphics
cards
can
make
more
realistic
or
more
advanced
images
in
the
same
way
a
well
trained
artist
can

eurasia

history
main
history
of
china
ancient
china
was
one
of
the
first
civilizations
and
was
active
since
the
millennium
as
a
<collocation>feudal society</collocation>


chinese
civilization
was
also
one
of
the
few
to
invent
writing
the
others
being
mesopotamia
the
<collocation>indus valley</collocation>
civilization
the
maya
civilization
the
minoan
civilization
of
ancient
greece
and
ancient
egypt


it
reached
its
golden
age
during
the
<collocation>tang dynasty</collocation>
about
century


china
is
home
to
some
of
the
oldest
artwork
in
the
world


statues
and
pottery
as
well
as
decorations
made
of
jade
are
some
classic
examples


its
land
area
has
mostly
looked
like
that
of
modern
china
except
with
northern
and
western
edges
that
varied


it
was
often
attacked
by
northern
people
such
as
<collocation>genghis khan</collocation>
and
khan


while
china
achieved
many
things
in
the
first
millennium
and
early
millennium
it
became
an
isolationist
country
in
the
century
by
the
renaissance
european
powers
started
to
take
over
other
countries
in
asia


while
china
was
never
actually
taken
over
many
european
countries
such
as
britain
and
france
built
spheres
of
influence
in
china


since
china
had
cut
itself
off
from
the
world
over
the
previous
few
centuries
by
the
dynasty
it
had
fallen
behind
other
countries
in
technology
and
was
helpless
to
stop
this
from
happening


this
