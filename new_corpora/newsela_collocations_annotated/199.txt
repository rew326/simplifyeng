volcanoes
erupt

of
volcanoes


<collocation>shield volcanoes</collocation>
<collocation>shield volcanoes</collocation>
are
built
out
of
layers
of
lava
from
continual
eruptions
without
explosions


because
the
lava
is
so
fluid
it
spreads
out
often
over
a
wide
area


<collocation>shield volcanoes</collocation>
do
not
grow
to
a
great
height
and
the
layers
of
lava
spread
out
to
give
the
volcano
gently
<collocation>sloping sides</collocation>


<collocation>shield volcanoes</collocation>
can
produce
huge
areas
of
basalt
which
is
usually
what
lava
is
when
cooled


even
though
their
sides
are
not
very
steep
<collocation>shield volcanoes</collocation>
can
be
huge

a
also
known
as
a
<collocation>composite volcano</collocation>
is
a
tall
<collocation>conical volcano</collocation>


it
is
built
up
of
many
layers
of
hardened
lava
pumice
and
<collocation>volcanic ash</collocation>


unlike
<collocation>shield volcanoes</collocation>
have
a
<collocation>steep profile</collocation>
and

the
lava
that
flows
from
cools
and
hardens
before
spreading
far


it
is
sticky
that
is
it
has
high
viscosity


the
magma
forming
this
lava
is
often
with
levels
of
silica
and
less
magma


big
lava
flows
are
uncommon
but
have
traveled
as
far
as

two
famous

both
have
big
bases

vesuvius
is
famous
for
its
destruction
of

towns
pompeii

in

killing
thousands


caldera
a
caldera
is
what
is
left
when
a
huge
blows
its
top
off


it
leaves
a
crater

<collocation>ash cloud</collocation>
there
are
two
main
processes


volcanoes
are
made
when
two
<collocation>tectonic plates</collocation>
come
together


when
these
two
plates
meet
one
of
them
usually
the
oceanic
plate
goes
under
the
continental
plate


this
is
the
process
of
subduction


afterwards
it
melts
and
makes
magma
inside
the
<collocation>magma chamber</collocation>
and
the
pressure
builds
up
until
the
magma
bursts
through
the
earth
crust


the
second
way
is
when
a
<collocation>tectonic plate</collocation>
moves
over
a
hot
spot
in
the
earth
crust


the
hot
spot
works
its
way
through
the
crust
until
it
breaks
through


the
caldera
of
yellowstone
park
was
formed
in
that
way
so
were
the
hawaiian
islands


classification
edinburgh

a
traditional
way
to
classify
or
identify
volcanoes
is
by
its
pattern
of
eruptions


those
volcanoes
which
may
erupt
again
at
any
time
are
called
active


those
that
are
now
quiet
called
dormant
inactive


those
volcanos

times

largest
volcano
on
earth
the
earth
largest
volcano
has
been
discovered


it
is
below
the
sea
on
an
underwater
plateau
known
as
the
rise


this
is
about
km
east
of
japan


the
previous
loa
in
hawaii
is
still
the
largest
volcano
on
land


the
sq
km
sq
mi
volcano
massif
is
comparable
in
size
to
mars
<collocation>vast olympus</collocation>
volcano
which
is
the
largest
in
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>


it
was
formed
about
million
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
when
massive
lava
flows
erupted
from
the
center
of
the
volcano
to
form
a
broad
feature


that
suggests
the
volcano
produced
a
<collocation>flood basalt</collocation>
eruption


the
massif
extends
some
km
miles
into
the
earth
crust


the
researchers
doubted
the
submerged
volcano
peak
ever
rose
above
sea
level
during
its
lifetime
and
say
it
is
unlikely
to
erupt
again


the
bottom
line
is
that
we
think
that
massif
was
built
in
a
short
geologically
speaking
time
of
one
to
several
million
years
and
it
has
been
extinct
since
william
sager
of
the
university
of
houston
told
the
news
agency


there
were
lots
of
oceanic
plateaus
that
erupted
during
the
cretaceous
period
million
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
but
we
do
see
them
since


scientists
would
like
to
know
why
the
biggest
<collocation>oceanic plateau</collocation>
is
java
plateau
near
the
equator
in
the
pacific
east
of
the
solomon
islands


it

it

for
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
model
is
that
the
universe
begun
in
an
extremely
dense
and
hot
condition
and
has
expanded


the
theory
suggests
and
measurements
show
that
the
universe
is
still
expanding
today


the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
is
the
name
of
a
scientific
theory
about
how
the
universe
started
and
then
made
the
groups
of
stars
called
galaxies
we
see
today


in
the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
theory
the
universe
began
as
very
hot
small
and
dense
with
no
stars
atoms
form
or
structure
called
a
singularity


then
about
billion
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
space
expanded
very
quickly
thus
the
name
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
resulting
in
the
formation
of
atoms
which
eventually
led
to
the
creation
of
stars
and
galaxies


the
universe
is
still
expanding
today
but
getting
colder
as
well


as
a
whole
space
is
growing
and
the
temperature
is
falling
as
time
passes


cosmology
is
the
name
given
to
how
the
universe
began
and
how
it
has
developed


scientists
that
study
cosmology
agree
the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
theory
matches
what
they
have
observed
so
far


fred
hoyle
called
the
theory
the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
on
his
radio
show


he
did
not
believe
the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
was
correct


scientists
who
did
not
agree
with
him
thought
the
name
was
funny
and
decided
to
use
it


since
then
fred
hoyle
reasons
for
not
agreeing
with
the
theory
have
been
proven
wrong


scientists
base
the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
theory
on
many
different
observations


the
most
important
is
the
of
very
far
away
galaxies


is
the
<collocation>doppler effect</collocation>
occurring
in
light


when
an
object
moves
away
from
earth
it
looks
reddish
because
the
movement
stretches
the
wavelength


the
reddish
color
occurs
because
red
is
the
lowest
wavelength
on
the
<collocation>visible spectrum</collocation>


the
more
there
is
the
faster
the
object
is
moving
away


by
measuring
the
scientists
proved
that
the
universe
is
expanding
and
can
even
work
out
how
fast
the
object
is
moving


with
<collocation>precise observation</collocation>
and
measurements
scientists
believe
that
universe
was
a
singularity
approximately
billion
<collocation>years ago</collocation>


because
most
things
become
colder
as
they
expand
the
universe
is
assumed
to
have
been
very
hot
when
it
started


other
observations
that
support
the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
theory
are
the
amounts
of
chemical
elements
in
the
universe


amounts
of
hydrogen
helium
and
lithium
seem
to
agree
with
the
theory
of
the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>


scientists
also
have
found
cosmic
<collocation>microwaves background</collocation>
radiation


this
radiation
is
known
as
radio
waves
and
they
are
everywhere
in
the
universe


even
so
it
is
now
very
weak
and
cold
but
a
long
time
ago
it
was
very
strong
and
very
hot


the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
might
also
have
been
the
beginning
of
time


if
the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
was
the
beginning
of
time
then
there
was
no
universe
before
the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
since
there
was
no
concept
of
before
without
time


other
ideas
state
that
the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
was
not
the
beginning
of
time
billion
<collocation>years ago</collocation>


instead
some
believe
that
there
was
a
different
universe
before
and
it
may
have
been
very
different
from
the
one
we
know
today


the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
idea
is
based
on
science


some
religious
groups
reject
the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
theory
on
grounds
that
it
conflicts
with
their
teachings


the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
theory
is
not
a
religious
teaching


it
is
based
on
observations
of
the
universe
and
is
an
attempt
at
explaining
them
without
<collocation>religious undertones</collocation>


who
originally
came
up
with
this
theory
was
a
catholic
priest
and
there
are
many
religious
groups
who
do
accept
the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
theory
as
it
does
in
itself
conflict
with
being
religious

analysis
is
the
process
of
breaking
a
complex
topic
or
substance
into
smaller
parts
to
gain
a
better
understanding
of
it


the
technique
has
been
applied
in
the
study
of
mathematics
and
logic
since
before
aristotle
though
analysis
as
a
formal
concept
is
a
relatively
recent
development


the
word
comes
from
the
ancient
greek
a
breaking
up
from
ana
up
throughout
and
lysis
a
loosening


in
this
context
analysis
is
the
opposite
of
synthesis
which
is
to
bring
ideas
together


the
following
concepts
are
closely
related
to
this
basic
idea
mathematical
analysis
is
the
name
given
to
any
branch
of
mathematics
that
looks
at
what
functions
are
how
they
behave
and
what
things
can
be
done
with
them

sancho
is
an

peasant

to
have
little
sense

experience


however
as
the
tale
unfolds
he
reveals
himself
to
possess
a
wealth
of
<collocation>common sense</collocation>
first
expressed
through
endless
proverbs
but
then
through
his
own
skill


in
this
sense
he
provides
a
<collocation>comic juxtaposition</collocation>
to
quixote
himself
who
is
highly
educated
but
insane
both
of
them
supply
what
the
other
