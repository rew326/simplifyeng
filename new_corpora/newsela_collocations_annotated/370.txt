meteors
falling
to
earth
a
meteor
is
what
you
see
when
a
space
rock
falls
to
earth


it
is
often
known
as
a
shooting
star
or
falling
star
and
can
be
a
bright
light
in
the
night
sky
though
most
are
faint


if
it
hits
the
ground
it
is
then
called
a
meteorite
and
a
large
one
sometimes
leaves
a
hole
in
the
ground
called
a
crater


may
range
in
size
from
large
pieces
of
rock
to
tiny
dust
particles
floating
in
space
that
did
not
form
planets


when
the
enter
earth
atmosphere
they
are
usually
going
faster
than
the
earth
<collocation>escape velocity</collocation>
of
or
mach


this
makes
them
heat
up
and
usually
break
apart


when
the
heat
makes
them
glow
they
are
known
as
meteors


meteors
are
distinct
from
comets
or
asteroids
but
some
especially
those
associated
with
meteor
showers
are
dust
particles
that
came
out
of
comets


there
are
several
types
of
meteorites
including
stony
carbonaceous
and


stony
meteorites
are
named
because
they
are
largely
made
up
of
mineral
material


carbonaceous
have
a
high
carbon
content


meteorites
are
mostly
iron
often
with
significant
nickel
as
well


meteors
sometimes
hurt
people
and
property


the
russian
meteor
event
did
the
most
damage


large
<collocation>meteorite strikes</collocation>
may
have
played
a
part
in
several
of
the
mass
and
so
indirectly
on
the
course
of
evolution

something
about
non

appealed
to
me


in
philosophy
i
started
studying
logic
and
they
were
talking
about
cause
and
effect
and
you
start
to
realize
hey
there
is
no
cause
and
effect


there
is
no
logic


there
is
no
anything


then
it
gets
real
easy
to
write
this
stuff
because
all
you
have
to
do
is
twist
everything
hard
you
twist
the
punch
line
you
twist
the
non

so
hard
away
from
