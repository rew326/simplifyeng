the
scallop
has

main

arthropods
such
as
this
<collocation>carpenter bee</collocation>
have
<collocation>compound eyes</collocation>
<collocation>compound eyes</collocation>
are
different
from
simple
eyes


instead
of
having
one
organ
that
can
sense
light
they
put
together
many
such
organs


some
<collocation>compound eyes</collocation>
have
thousands
of
them


the
resulting
image
is
put
together
in
the
brain
based
on
the
signals
of
the
many
eye
units


each
such
unit
is
called
several
are
called


the
are
located
on
a
convex
surface
each
of
them
points
in
a
different
direction


unlike
simple
eyes
<collocation>compound eyes</collocation>
have
a
very
large
angle
of
view


they
can
detect
fast
movement
and
sometimes
the
polarization
of
light


<collocation>compound eyes</collocation>
are
common
in
arthropods
and
some
molluscs
evolution
of
the
eye
the
evolution
of
eyes
started
with
simplest
patches
in
unicellular
organisms


these
do
nothing
but
detect
if
the
surroundings
are
light
or
dark


most
animals
have
a
biochemical
clock
inside


these
simple
are
used
to
adjust
this
daily
clock
which
is
called
circadian
rhythm


some
snails
for
example
see
no
image
picture
at
all
but
they
sense
light
which
helps
them
stay
out
of
bright
sunlight


more
complex
eyes
have
not
lost
this
function


a
special
type
of
cells
in
the
eye
senses
light
for
a
different
purpose
than
seeing


these
cells
are
called
ganglion
cells


they
are
located
in
the
retina


they
send
their
information
about
light
to
the
brain
along
a
different
path
the
tract


this
information
adjusts
synchronizes
the
animal
circadian
rhythm
to
nature
cycle
of
hours


the
system
also
works
for
some
blind
people
who
can
not
see
light
at
all


eyes
that
are
a
<collocation>little bit</collocation>
better
are
shaped
like
cups
which
lets
the
animal
know
where
the
light
is
coming
from


more
complex
eyes
give
the
full
sense
of
vision
including
color
motion
and
texture


these
eyes
have
a
round
shape
that
makes
light
rays
focus
on
the
back
part
of
the
eye
called
the
retina


other
the
compound
eye
of
a
dragonfly
<collocation>good fliers</collocation>
like
flies
or
honey
bees
or
insects
like
praying
mantis
or
dragonflies
have
specialized
zones
of
organized
into
a
fovea
area
which
gives
sharp
vision


in
this
zone
the
eyes
are
flattened
and
the
facets
are
larger


the
flattening
allows
more
to
receive
light
from
a
spot


this
gives
a
higher
resolution


the
body
of
a
type
of
brittle
star
is
covered
with
turning
its
whole
skin
into
a
compound

their
skeletons
are
made
out
of
thin
hard
pieces
or
plates
like
armor
made
of
chitin


all
together
these
pieces
make
a
hard
layer
around
the
insect
body


the
exoskeleton
protects
the
insect


the
body
of
an
insect
has
three
main
parts
a
head
a

and
an
abdomen


on

all
insects
have
six
legs
three
pairs
of
jointed
legs
and
usually
four

two
pairs


the
abdomen
is
the
back
part
of
the
insect


inside
the
abdomen
is
the
stomach
the
heart
and
the
system
where

physiology
just
like
our
muscles
connect
to
our
bones
to
make
us
walk
and
stand
up
the
muscles
of
an
insect
connect
to
the
exoskeleton
to
make
it

their
muscles
are
on
the
inside
of
their
skeleton


insects
are
which
means
that
they
can
not
control
their
body
temperature


this
means
that
insects
are
not
good
at
surviving
the
cold
at
any
rate
out
in
the
open


in
the
winter
many
insects
go
into
something
called
which
is
the
insect
version
of
hibernation


some
insects
like
cockroaches
can
not
go
into
and
they
will
die
if
it
gets
too
cold
outside


this
is
why
<collocation>cockroaches love</collocation>
living
in
people
warm
houses


respiratory
and
circulatory
systems
insect
respiration
happens
without
lungs


there
is
a
system
of
internal
tubes
and
sacs
through
which
<collocation>gases diffuse</collocation>
or
are
actively
pumped


air
is
taken
in
through
openings
on
the
sides
of
the
abdomen
called
spiracles


oxygen
gets
to
tissues
that
need
it
through
their
trachea
element
in
diagram


as
larvae
many
insects
have
gills
that
can
extract
oxygen
dissolved
in
water
while
others
need
to
rise
to
the
water
surface
to
replenish
air
supplies
which
may
be
held
or
trapped
in
special
structures


insects
use

how
insects
grow
a
mantis
nymph
looks
just
like
a
<collocation>mantis adult</collocation>
but
much
smaller


insects
start
life
as
an
egg


usually
a
female
mother
insect
lays
eggs
but
a
few
species
have
live
birth
the
eggs
develop
inside
the
mother


the
eggs
are
small
but
they
can
usually
be
seen
with
the
naked
eye


although
the
adults
are
larger
they
do
need
a
magnifying
glass
or
a
binocular
microscope
to
see
the
details


a
professional
entomologist
uses
a
binocular
microscope
to
identify
insects
plus
a
printed
reference
work


there
are
far
too
many
insects
for
anyone
to
remember
them
all
and
most
entomologists
specialise
in
just
one
or
two
orders


after
the
eggs
hatch
two
kinds
of
development
may
occur


some
insects
have
what
is
called
incomplete
metamorphosis


this
means
that
a
small
insect
called
a
nymph
comes
out
of
the
egg
and
the
nymph
looks
almost
the
same
as
the
adult
insect


as
the
nymph
grows
it
does
not
change
the
way
it
looks
but
only
how
big
it
is


it
goes
through
a
number
of
stages
called


grasshoppers
grow
in
this
way


other
insects
have
<collocation>complete metamorphosis</collocation>
which
means
that
the
small
larva
which
comes
out
of
the
egg
looks
very
different
from
the
adult
insect


insects
that
have
<collocation>complete metamorphosis</collocation>
usually
come
out
of
the
egg
as
a
larva
which
usually
looks
like
a
worm


the
larva
eats
food
and
gets
bigger
until
it
turns
into
a
pupa


<collocation>butterfly pupae</collocation>
plural
for
pupa
are
often
inside
cocoons


inside
the
cocoon
the
insect
changes
the
way
it
looks
and
often
grows
wings


when
the
cocoon
opens
the
adult
insect
comes
out


many
insects
have
<collocation>complete metamorphosis</collocation>
for
example
beetles
butterflies
and
moths
and
flies


the
adult
stage
of
development
is
called
the


evolutionary
history
origin
of
insects
the
oldest
known
insect
fossil
is
the
devonian
from
the
million
year
old


it
may
have
superficially
resembled
a
silverfish
insect


this
species
already
possessed
mandibles
of
a
type
associated
with
<collocation>winged insects</collocation>
suggesting
that
wings
may
already
have
evolved
at
this
time


thus
the
first
insects
probably
appeared
earlier
in
the
silurian
period


origin
of
wings
in
<collocation>researchers uncovered</collocation>
what
they
believe
is
the
world
oldest
known
impression
of
a
primitive
flying
insect
a
specimen
from
the
<collocation>carboniferous period</collocation>


the
origins
of
insect
flight
remain
obscure
since
the
earliest
<collocation>winged insects</collocation>
currently
known
appear
to
have
been
capable
fliers


some
extinct
insects
had
an
additional
pair
of
attaching
to
the
first
segment
of
the
thorax
for
a
total
of
three
pairs


it
seems
the
insects
were
not
a
particularly
successful
group
of
animals
before
they
evolved
wings


<collocation>upper carboniferous</collocation>
and
lower
insect
orders
include
both
living
groups
and
a
number
of
groups
now
extinct


during
this
era
some
giant
forms
reached
of
convert
to
cm
in
on
making
them
far
larger
than
any
living
insect


this
gigantism
may
have
been
due
to
higher
atmospheric
oxygen
levels
which
allowed
increased
respiratory
efficiency


the
lack
of
flying
vertebrates
could
have
been
another
factor


many
of
the
early
groups
became
extinct
during
the
<collocation>extinction event</collocation>
the
largest
mass
extinction
in
the
history
of
the
earth
around
million
<collocation>years ago</collocation>

or


different
kinds
of
insects
can
be
divided
into
groups
called
orders


there
are
many
insect
orders


the
biggest
insect
orders
are
listed
below
beetles
order
have
the
front
pair
of
wings
changed
into
a
hard
shell
to
protect
the
back

moths
order
lepidoptera
have
large
often
colorful
wings


flies
order
have
only
two
wings


ants
bees
and
wasps
order
hymenoptera
sometimes
have
stingers
and
sometimes
live
in
large
colonies
like
ant
hills


true
bugs
order
have
a
mouth
that
is
long
and
narrow
like
a
<collocation>drinking straw</collocation>


this
kind
of
mouth
is
called
a

grasshoppers
order
can
usually
jump
with
their
legs


eat
grass
and
grain
plants


dragonflies
and
are
top
predators
of
other
insects


both
aquatic
nymphs
and
flying
adults
are
carnivorous


the
stick

contrary
to
what
some
people
believe
spiders
scorpions
and
similar
animals
are
not

they
are
arachnids


arachnids
are
arthropods
that
have

pests
can
be
harmful
to
people
in
different
ways


some
are
parasites
such
as
lice
and
bed
bugs


some
of
these
parasite
insects
can
spread
diseases
such
as
mosquitoes
spreading
malaria


other
pest
insects
do
not
directly
hurt
people


termites
and
some
beetles
eat
wood
and
sometimes
eat
buildings
such
as
houses


however
termites
also
help
break
down
the
trees
and
branches
that
fall
on
the
forest
floor


many
insects
eat
agricultural
products
plants
meant
for
people
to
eat


grasshoppers
are
one
example
of
pest
insects
that
eat
plants
in
agriculture


some
insects
are
useful
to
us


bees
make
honey


the
larvae
of
some
moths
make
silk
which
people
use
to
make
clothing


in
some
parts
of
the
world
people
actually
eat
insects


eating
insects
for
food
is
called


many
bees
and
flies
pollinate
plants


this
means
the
insects
help
the
plants
make
seeds
by
moving
pollen
from
one
flower
to
another


some
good
insects
eat
pest
insects
such
as
<collocation>lady beetles</collocation>
or
or
ladybugs
eating
aphids


many
insects
eat
dead
plants
and
animals


pesticides
people
often
use
poisons
called
insecticides
to
kill
pest
insects


insecticides
do
not
always
work


sometimes
the
pest
insects
become
resistant
to
the
insecticides
which
means
the
insecticides
do
not
hurt
them
anymore


both
the
colorado
potato
beetle
and
the
diamondback
moth
are
insects
that
are
resistant
to
many
insecticides


insecticides
do
not
only
kill
pest
insects
sometimes
many
helpful
insects
are
killed
too


when
helpful
insects
are
killed
such
as
those
that
eat
pest
insects
the
pest
insects
may
come
back
in
larger
numbers
than
before
because
they
are
not
being
eaten
by
helpful
insects
anymore
