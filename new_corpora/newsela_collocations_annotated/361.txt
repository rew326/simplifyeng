is
a
sport
played
by
throwing
<collocation>soft balls</collocation>
or
hard
<collocation>rubber balls</collocation>
at
people
in
a
square
court


the
goal
is
to
be
the
last
one
to
be
hit
with
the
ball


players
may
only
throw
balls
at
people
who
are
not
on
their
own
team


if
a
player
is
hit
by
the
ball
he
or
she
should
go
to
the
outside
of
the
court
to
the
other
team


from
the
outside
players
throw
the
ball
at
players
still
on
the
inside


is
often
played
in
elementary
schools
in
physical
education
classes


many
school
children
play
this
game


in
recent
years
many
adults
who
played
it
as
children
have
formed
adult
leagues
and
clubs


also
some
schools
have
banned
it
this
means
that
made
it
against
the
rules
to
play
it
because
players
can
get
hurt
when
playing
the
game


tournaments
are
sometimes
held
in
schools


because
of
its
recent
popularity
inspired
a
film
a
true
<collocation>underdog story</collocation>
starring
<collocation>ben stiller</collocation>
and
and
a
game
show
extreme


a
local
area
network
lan
is
a
group
of
computers
network
in
a
small
area
like
a
home
office
or
school


many
computers
can
be
connected
to
share
information
and
internet
connections


most
use
ethernet
to
connect
together


lan
tell
you
how
network
devices
are
organized


five
common
lan
exist
bus
ring
star
tree
and
mesh


these
are
<collocation>logical architectures</collocation>


this
means
that
they
tell
you
the
directions
that
signals
go
between
devices
but
that
the
actual
cables
that
connect
the
devices
might
not
be
connected
the
same
way


for
example
logical
bus
and
ring
are
commonly
organized
physically
as
a
star


a
bus
means
that
the
signal
is
put
onto
the
medium
and
every
device
on
the
bus
receives
the
signal


if
more
than
one
device
tries
to
send
a
signal
at
the
same
time
they
can
interfere
with
each
other


a
long
copper
wire
with
other
wires
tapped
into
it
is
an
example
of
a
bus


a
ring
means
that
each
device
talks
to
two
other
devices
in
the
network
and
the
devices
all
talk
in
a
circle


if
a
computer
sends
data
out
one
of
its
interfaces
it
could
get
an
answer
back
on
the
other
one


some
rings
send
traffic
in
only
one
direction
other
ring
networks
send
traffic
in
both
directions


token
ring
and
are
examples
of
ring


a
star
means
that
one
device
the
middle
of
the
star
connects
to
several
other
devices


the
only
way
devices
on
the
points
of
the
star
can
talk
to
each
other
is
through
the
device
in
the
middle


a
network
switch
is
an
example
of
a
star


computers
on
the
lan
need
to
go
through
the
switch
to
talk
to
each
other


a
tree
or
hybrid
is
named
because
when
you
draw
a
picture
of
how
the
devices
in
this
are
connected
it
starts
off
narrow
with
few
devices
at
the
bottom
then
branches
out
at
the
top


large
networks
are
an
example
of
a
tree


there
are
switches
and
servers
near
the
bottom
of
the
tree
then
all
the
user
computers
branch
out
at
the
top
of
the
tree


a
mesh
means
that
every
device
can
talk
to
every
other
device
and
they
will
not
interfere
with
each
other


you
can
also
have
a
partial
mesh
where
some
devices
do
not
talk
to
all
of
the
others


there
are
not
many
simple
examples
of
a
mesh
network


a
wireless
data
network
where
all
of
the
devices
use
or
different
frequencies
to
avoid
interfering
with
each
other
would
be
one
example
