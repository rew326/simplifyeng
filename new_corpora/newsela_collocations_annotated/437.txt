love
is
the
feeling
of
liking
somebody
or
something
very
much


people
sometimes
get
married
or
go
on
a
date
when
someone
loves
another


love
is
usually
believed
to
have
something
to
do

introduction
according
to
one
of
the
young
pakistani
philosopher


love
is
not
a
word
which
is
simply
understandable
it
is
the
feeling
of
heart
which
one
can
only
observe
practically


forms
of
love
there
are
many
kinds
of
love


there
can
be
love
towards
a
friend
love
in
romance
towards
family
toward
god
or
towards
an
object
or
idea


often
love
can
be
confused
with
other
feelings


being
sexually
or
physically
attracted
is
the
feeling
of
lust


lust
and
love
may
be
thought
of
as
different


besides
that
normal
friendship
can
be
distracted
by
love


sometimes
love
can
be
destroyed


when
love
is
destroyed
between
a
dating
couple
they
may
break
up
with
each
other


love
is
based
on
respect
understanding
and
being
able
to
talk
with
each
other

a

is

first
love
people
describe
the
person
that
they
first
loved
romantically
as
their
first
love


for
example
in
william
shakespeare
romeo
and
juliet
romeo
is
juliet
very
first
love


at
that
time
she
was
only


in
maria
book
vincent
says
first
loves
are
silly
things


chemical
basis
the
biological
model
of
sex
is
different
from
love
because
it
is
more
like
hunger
or
thirst


helen
fisher
an
expert
in
the
topic
of
love
divides
love
into
three
stages
lust
attraction
and
attachment


lust
makes
people
like
each
other
<collocation>romantic attraction</collocation>
encourages
people
to
focus
on
mating
and
attachment
helps
people
tolerate
the
spouse
or
the
child


lust
is
the
<collocation>passionate sexual</collocation>
desire
that
promotes
mating


this
usually
lasts
only
a
few
weeks
or
months


attraction
is
more
for
one
person
specially


recent
studies
in
neuroscience
say
that
as
people
fall
in
love
the
brain
releases
chemicals
including
dopamine


these
chemicals
make
people
less
hungry
and
sleepy
and
also
adds
an
intense
feeling
of
excitement


research
shows
that
this
stage
normally
lasts
from
one
and
a
half
to
three
years


since
these
lust
and
attraction
stages
are
both
described
as
temporary
a
third
stage
might
describe
love


attachment
can
be
used
to
describe
the
bonding
period
that
helps
keep
husband
and
wife
together
for
many
years


attachment
occurs
in
the
longer
term


love
and
health
love
has
consequences
for
health
and


joyful
activities
such
as
love
activate
areas
in
the
brain
responsible
for
emotion
attention
motivation
and
memory
and
it
may
further
lead
to
