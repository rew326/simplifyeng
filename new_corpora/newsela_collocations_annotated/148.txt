dog


blindness
is
the
inability
to
see
anything


some
people
are
called
blind
even
though
they
can
see
a
<collocation>little bit</collocation>


this
is
because
they
can
not
see
clearly
but
only
see
<collocation>fuzzy shapes</collocation>
or
colors


in
modern
countries
few
young
people
are
blind


in
all
the
world
blindness
is
mostly
caused
by
malnutrition
and
diseases
of
old
people
like
cataracts
and
trachoma


people
can
become
blind
because
of
diseases
or
accidents
but
sometimes
people
are
born
blind


some
people
are
color
blind
which
means
they
can
see
but
can
not
tell
certain
colors
apart


when
people
are
blind
they
use
such
things
as
the
alphabet
in
braille
and
guide
dogs
to
do
every
day
life
things


famous
blind
people
have

december
the
red

shows
the
arctic
region
border
the
arctic
is
the
area
around
the
earth
north
pole


the
arctic
includes
parts
of
russia
alaska
canada
greenland
lapland
and
as
well
as
the
arctic
ocean


it
is
an
ocean
but
it
is
always
frozen
so
it
is
solid
ice


most
scientists
call
the
area
north
of
the
<collocation>treeline arctic</collocation>


trees
will
not
grow
when
the
temperatures
get
too
cold


the
forests
of
the
continents
stop
when
they
get
too
far
north
or
too
high
up
a
mountain


it
gets
colder
as
you
go
higher
in
altitude
too


the
place
where
in
the
trees
stop
is
called
the
treeline


the
area
north
of
the
treeline
is
not
an
empty
ice
field


in
fact
the
only
land
is
central
greenland
which
is
covered
by
a
<collocation>continental glacier</collocation>


the
land
of
the
arctic
is
around
the
edges
of
the
arctic
circle
and
is
usually
covered
with
tundra


a
tundra
is
a
cold
almost
treeless
plain
covered
with
moss
and
plants
called
sedges


do
not
get
very
much
rain
or
snow


however
they
are
very
wet
in
the
summer
time
because
three
feet
or
so
below
the
surface
the
ground
is
always
frozen


this
permafrost
is
a
layer
of
ice
with
the
hardness
of
stone
that
keeps
water
from
soaking
into
the
earth
beneath
it


permafrost
can
be
thousands
of
feet
thick


in
the
summer
the
ground
on
top
thaws
out
when
the
sun
shines
and
the
snow
that
did
fall
melts


but
the
melted
snow
can
not
drain
into
the
ground
it
just
soaks
the
topsoil


there
is
no
place
for
the
water
to
go
except
to
form
lakes
and
puddles
on
top
of
the
ground
until
it
freezes
again
or
dries
up


in
the
arctic
during
summer
there
are
nights
when
the
sun
never
sets


this
is
because
during
summer
there
the
north
pole
points
toward
the
sun


so
sometimes
people
call
it
the
land
of
the
midnight
sun


the
word
comes
from
the
greek
word
meaning
bear


the
north
pole
aims
at
the
stars
called
the
great
bear
and
the
little
bear


this
is
why
it
is
called
the
arctic

plant
life
in
some
parts
of
the
arctic
the
ground
is
covered
with
flowers
during
the
short
summer


these
little
plants
have
very
short
stems


they
must
stay
close
to
the
ground
because
the
earth
is
warmer
than
the
biting
winds
that
blow
above
it


even
some
rocks
have
plants
growing
on
them


these
rock
plants
are
called


will
grow
on
the
bare
rocks


yellow
reindeer
moss
is
really
a
lichen


it
grows
slowly
but
often
grows
over
six
inches
cm
tall


it
is
spongy
and
full
of
water


this
plant
is
the
summer
food
for
reindeer


trees
are
almost
seen
on
the
tundra


only
in
the
protected
valleys
or
along
the
riverbanks
are
small
trees
able
to
grow


rivers
come
into
the
arctic
from
the
warmer
south


the
places
along
their
banks
are
a
<collocation>little bit</collocation>
warmer
than
the
rest
of
the
tundra


this
means
trees
can
grow
there


only
a
few
clusters
of
bushes
grow
sparingly


berries
are
the
only
fruit
that
grows
in
the
arctic


each
summer
the
ice
and
snow
will
melt
allowing
the
animals
to
find
food
and
the
plants
to
flower


the
moisture
from
the
snow
stays
toward
the
top
of
the
ground
surface


plant
roots
can
use
it
for
their
growth


even
so
in
many
places
the
soil
is
too
poor
for
plant
growth


less
than
half
of
the
tundra
has
plants
growing
on
it


animal
life
the
<collocation>polar bear</collocation>
is
the
world
largest
land
animal


<collocation>polar bears</collocation>
were
perfectly
designed
to
<collocation>hunt seals</collocation>
out
on
the
ice


they
are
excellent
swimmers
and
the
coldest
water
does
not
bother
them


they
just
jump
into
any
leads
that
open
in
the
pack
ice
and
swim
across


they
are
quiet
enough
to
sneak
up
on
a
sleeping
seal
and
strong
enough
to
kill
it
with
one
blow


they
have
a
very
strong
sense
of
smell
which
they
use
to
find
prey
out
on
the
ice


<collocation>polar bears</collocation>
live
most
of
their
lives
out
on
the
pack
ice


males
go
to
the
land
only
when
the
ice
is
gone


the
females
however
will
dig
themselves
into
a
den
of
snow
on
land
for
the
winter


there
the
mother
bears
have
their
cubs
usually
twins


bears
usually
eat
fish
birds
eggs
seaweed
and
dead
whales
but
they
would
rather
have
a
meal
of
seal
or
walrus


the
arctic
fox
will
often
trail
the
bears
onto
the
ice
to
eat
their
leftover
food


the
fox
also
eats
rabbits
lemmings
and


the
lemmings
and
are
the
rats
and
mice
of
the
arctic


the
lemmings
have
very
short
tails


they
live
underground
in
summer


because
the
top
soil
freezes
in
the
winter
they
can
not
burrow
underground
then
so
they
live
under
the
snow
during
the
colder
months


they
eat
plants
and
roots


if
they
find
plenty
of
food
they
have
extra
large
families
that
year


in
a
year
with
plenty
of
food
millions
of
lemmings
will
be
roaming
the
tundra


the
owls
and
foxes
have
more
food
than
they
can
eat


they
will
have
extra
babies
in
they
years
when
there
are
so
many
lemmings


however
the
tundra
does
not
have
enough
food
for
millions
of
lemmings


they
rush
across
the
tundra
looking
for
food
and
are
eaten
by
predators
or
starve
to
death


some
try
to
swim
across
lakes
or
rivers
and
drown


the
few
that
remain
continue
to
have
families


caribou
and
their
relative
the
reindeer
live
in
the
arctic
too


the
caribou
are
now
found
mostly
in
north
america
and
they
are
larger
than
the
reindeer


large
herds
feed
on
the
grass
and


when
fall
comes
they
move
south
to
winter
feeding
grounds


they
dig
through
the
snow
with
their
sharp
hoofs
for
food


their
hollow
fur
creates
a
cushion
of
air
around
them
that
helps
them
to
stay
warm


in
the
spring
they
return
north
to
the
<collocation>summer pastures</collocation>
where
their
calves
are
born


an
hour
or
so
after
being
born
the
calves
are
able
to
follow
the
herd
toward
the
arctic
ocean


most
of
the
world
reindeer
live
in
europe
and
asia


some
of
these
reindeer
are
not
wild


they
have
been
tamed
by
who
protect
them
from
wolves
and
lead
the
migrations
each
spring
and
fall


also
the
musk
ox
which
looks
like
a
shaggy
buffalo
lives
in
the
arctic


in
summer
many
birds
visit
the
arctic
and
most
of
them
are
water
birds
such
as
geese
ducks
swans
loons
and
arctic
terns


flying
in
for
the
summer
they
raise
their
young
and
return
south
for
the
winter


the
<collocation>snowy owl</collocation>
and
the
stay
all
year


the
color
of
the
<collocation>snowy owl</collocation>
matches
the
snow


the
summer
feathers
change
to
white
when
it
gets
colder


the
smallest
animals
of
the
arctic
are
the
flies
and
the
mosquitoes


mosquitoes
and
black
flies
love
the
wet
summer
tundra


thick
swarms
of
large
<collocation>hungry bugs</collocation>
bite
both
men
and
animals


the
reindeer
try
to
escape
the
mosquitoes
by
running
to
<collocation>higher pastures</collocation>
but
the
only
real
help
comes
with
the
snow
and
cold
when
the
pesky
swarms
die
off
for
another
season


human
life
one
of
the
surprises
of
the
arctic
is
that
many
people
live
there


some
people
have
lived
there
for
thousands
of
years


eskimo
and
lapp
people
lived
in
the
arctic
long
before
<collocation>electric heaters</collocation>
and
modern
houses


the
a
home
of
the
in
an
extremely
northern
part
of
europe
there
is
a
place
called
lapland


it
is
not
a
country
but
parts
of
four
countries


the
people
who
lived
there
are
called
by
outsiders


they
call
themselves


the
of
these
four
countries
lived
there
long
before
the
countries
of
sweden
finland
and
russia
were
created


there
were
several
kinds
of
lapp
people


some
lived
by
the
ocean
and
lived
mostly
on
fish


another
group
lived
along
the
warmer
rivers


these
people
did
a
little
farming
hunting
and
fishing
to
live


but
the
best
known
of
the
lapp
people
were
the
nomads
who
raised
reindeer


the
survived
in
their
<collocation>harsh homeland</collocation>
by
the
reindeer


the
were
able
to
get
everything
they
needed
from
the
deer


they
ate
mostly
meat
milk
and
cheese


their
clothes
were
made
<collocation>reindeer skins</collocation>
and
wool


their
tents
were
also
made
from
<collocation>deer skins</collocation>


they
are
known
for
the
beautifully
decorated
woolen
clothing
they
made


the
protected
the
herds
moving
with
them
as
they
migrated
from
summer
to
<collocation>winter pastures</collocation>


they
used
trained
reindeer
to
pull
sleds
carrying
their
supplies


during
the
winter
the
herds
moved
south
of
the
treeline


the
would
live
nearby
in
homes
made
of
logs
or
sod


the
were
very
careful
not
to
waste
anything
they
got
from
the
reindeer


milk
was
taken
from
the
reindeer
to
drink
or
make
cheese


meat
was
taken
for
food


the
blood
was
frozen
in
chunks
and
used
for
soup
and
pancakes


knives
and
belt
buckles
were
carved
from
the
bones
and
antlers


the
sinews
were
used
as
sewing
thread


stomachs
were
used
to
carry
milk
or
cheese


every
part
of
a
dead
reindeer
was
used


winter
clothing
was
made
from
layers
of
deer
skin


the
inside
layer
would
be
worn
with
the
fur
facing
in
toward
the
person
skin


the
second
layer
was
worn
with
the
fur
facing
out


boots
were
also
made
of
fur
lined
with
grass
that
had
been
gathered
during
the
short
summer


every
evening
the
grass
would
be
taken
out
and
dried
by
the
fire
so
it
would
be
ready
to
use
again
the
next
day


thus
a
lapp
could
be
warm
and
comfortable
in
even
the
coldest
weather


today
only
a
few
of
the
lapp
people
still
follow
the
herds


those
few
use
modern
tools
on
their
ancient
migration


they
use
snowmobiles
to
herd
the
reindeer
and
rifles
to
kill
the
wolves
that
chase
them


even
helicopters
and
radios
are
used
to
locate
and
move
the
reindeer


most
of
the
lapp
people
now
live
on
small
farms
in
one
of
the
four
nations
of
lapland


they
raise
crops
and
animals
including
a
few
reindeer
to
meet
their
needs


the
sale
of
reindeer
meat
is
an
important
source
of
income
for
the
lapp
people


eskimos
a
drawing
of
an
eskimo
family
eskimos
are
arctic
people
too


they
ate
raw
meat


eskimos
were
also
nomads
but
they
did
not
have
any
animals
except
for
dogs
which
they
used
for
pulling
their
sleds
and
helping
them
hunt


they
were
hunters
and
gatherers
and
they
lived
off
on
whatever
they
found
or
killed


like
the
though
they
were
very
careful
to
make
good
use
of
every
part
of
the
animals
they
killed


eskimos
lived
in
tents
during
the
summer
and
<collocation>sod houses</collocation>
or
igloos
in
the
winter


the
eskimos
made
very
clever
things
from
the
bones
antlers
and
wood
they
had


they
invented
the
harpoon
which
was
used
to
hunt
and
they
built
boats


eskimos
did
not
have
a
government
or
laws
because
they
learned
early
in
life
to
help
each
other
in
order
to
survive


always
sharing
food
they
usually
moved
around
in
small
groups
looking
for
food


sometimes
they
get
together
in
a
large
group
when
they
hunted
big
animals
such
as
whales


the
men
did
the
hunting
and
building
the
homes
and
the
women
cooked
made
the
clothes
and
took
care
of
the
children


the
arctic
today
the
arctic
region
has
many
minerals
that
are
important
to
people


iron
lead
coal
copper
gold
and
tin
are
all
mined
in
different
parts
of
this
cold
land


large
amounts
of
petroleum
have
been
discovered
in
the
arctic
in
russia
alaska
and
canada


people
live
and
work
in
the
arctic
to
remove
these
valuable
minerals
and
sell
them


the
oil
in
alaska
for
example
is
very
important
to
the
united
states


the
main
source
of
the
oil
is
near
bay
on
alaska
north
coast


it
was
discovered
in


plans
were
quickly
made
to
build
a
pipeline
to
bring
the
oil
to
an
port
so
it
could
be
shipped
south


oil
companies
spent
billions
of
dollars
to
build
the
pipeline
in
the


it
had
to
be
built
above
the
ground
in
the
northern
section
because
of
the
permafrost


the
warm
oil
in
the
pipes
could
have
melted
the
permafrost
and
caused
the
ground
to
sink


that
would
have
broken
the
pipes
and
caused
an
<collocation>oil spill</collocation>


the
pipeline
was
completed
in


it
brings
oil
to
the
seaport
of
on
alaska
south
coast


from
there
the
oil
is
taken
by
huge
tankers
to
refineries
along
the
west
coast
of
the
united
states


if
you
live
in
western
america
your
family
car
may
have
alaskan
gasoline
in
its
tank


russia
has
more
land
in
the
arctic
than
any
other
nation


the
russian
arctic
in
asia
and
the
area
just
south
of
it
are
called
siberia


it
is
such
an
empty
harsh
place
that
it
has
been
used
as
a
colony
for
many
years


the
old
russian
rulers
and
the
modern
communist
soviets
would
send
criminals
and
people
who
disagreed
to
the
government
to
live
there


however
many
people
were
also
sent
there
to
remove
minerals
harvest
trees
from
forests
and
build
cities


russia
has
a
huge
port
city
right
in
lapland
within
the
arctic
circle


is
the
largest
city
north
of
the
arctic
circle


the
port
is
kept
by
the
warm
waters
of
the
<collocation>gulf stream</collocation>
coming
up
around
norway
and
sweden
from
the
south
atlantic


huge
icebreakers
work
to
keep
a
path
open
so
ships
can
reach
the
port


the
port
ships
out
fish
minerals
and
lumber
to
russia
and
the
rest
of
the
world


the
arctic
is
also
the
shortest
way
for
airlines
to
fly
between
some
cities
on
different
continents


the
flight
from
london
to
tokyo
for
example
is
miles
shorter
if
flown
across
the
top
of
the
world
instead
of
the
old
route
south
across
europe
and
asia


the
polar
route
from
san
francisco
to
norway
is
several
hours
shorter
than
the
same
flight
going
across
the
united
states
and
the
pacific
ocean


thus
man
is
making
use
of
the
arctic
in
various
ways
even
though
it
is
a
hard
place
to
live
