main
earthquake
engineering
some
places
such
as
japan
or
california
have
many
earthquakes
and
many
inhabitants


there
it
is
good
practice
to
construct
houses
and
other
buildings
which
will
resist
collapse
in
an
earthquake


this
is
called
seismic
design
or


the
haitian
national
palace
after
at
the
haiti
earthquake


buildings
are
constructed
to
withstand
the
destructive
force
of
an
earthquake


this
depends
upon
its
type
of
construction
shape
mass
distribution
and
rigidity


different
combinations
are
used


square
rectangular
and
buildings
can
withstand
earthquakes
better
than
skyscrapers


to
reduce
stress
a
building
ground
floor
can
be
supported
by
extremely
rigid
<collocation>hollow columns</collocation>
while
the
rest
of
the
building
is
supported
by
flexible
columns
inside
the
<collocation>hollow columns</collocation>


another
method
is
to
use
rollers
or
<collocation>rubber pads</collocation>
to
separate
the
base
columns
from
the
ground
allowing
the
columns
to
<collocation>shake parallel</collocation>
to
each
other
during
an
earthquake


to
help
prevent
a
roof
from
collapsing
builders
make
the
roof
out
of
materials


outdoor
walls
are
made
with
stronger
and
more
reinforced
materials
such
as
steel
or
reinforced
concrete


during
an
earthquake
flexible
windows
may
help
hold
the
windows
together
so
they
do
break

scurvy
is
a
disease
caused
by
not

people
who
have
scurvy
get

at
the
legs


their

may
loosen

they
may

sailors
used
to
get
scurvy
because
fresh
fruit
and
meat
could
not
be
kept
for
as
long
as
they
were

in

an
ion
is
an
electrically
charged
atom
or
group
of
atoms


it
is
a
part
of
an
atom
or
part
of
a
group
of
atoms
molecule


it
is
charged
so
it
will
move
near
electricity


this
is
because
atoms
are
made
of
three
smaller
parts
neutrons
with
no
charge
and
equal
numbers
of
charged
protons
and
electrons


an
ion
has
unequal
numbers
of
protons
and
electrons


making
an
ion
from
an
atom
or
molecule
is
called
ionization


the
charge
on
a
proton
is
measured
as
positively
charged
and
the
charge
on
an
electron
is
measured
as
negatively
charged


an
atom
that
is
ionized
makes
two
ions
one
positive
and
one
negatively
charged


for
example
a
neutral
hydrogen
atom
has
one
proton
and
one
electron


heating
the
atom
breaks
it
into
two
parts
a
positively
charged
hydrogen
ion
h
a
negatively
charged
electron


a
liquid
with
ions
is
called
an
electrolyte


a
gas
with
lots
of
ions
is
called
a
plasma


when
ions
move
it
is
called
electricity


for
example
in
a
wire
the
metal
ions
do
not
move
but
the
electrons
move
as
electricity


a
positive
ion
and
a
negative
ion
will
move
together


two
ions
of
the
same
charge
will
move
apart


when
ions
move
they
also
make
<collocation>magnetic fields</collocation>

soldiers
in
an
army


the
army
is
the
part
of
a
country
military
that
fights
on
the
ground


people
in
the
army
are
called
soldiers


many
modern
armies
have
vehicles
such
as
tanks
airplanes
and
helicopters
to
help
soldiers
fight
on
the
ground


a
soldier
may
be
a
volunteer
someone
who
joins
something
because
they
want
to
or
he
may
be
drafted
forced
by
the
government
to
join
the
army


forcing
men
to
join
the
army
is
called
conscription
or
draft


voluntary
armies
tend
to
be
small
by
numbers
but
high
in
confidence
and
quality


drafted
armies
are
large
but
often
lacking
in
confidence
and
in
quality
it
may
be
very
difficult
to
force
someone
to
risk
his
life
against
his
will


sometimes
an
army
may
be
made
up
from
mercenaries
soldiers
who
fight
just
for
pay
and
have
little
loyalty
to
the
country
which
they
serve


a
soldier
does
many
things
from
shooting
enemies
to
using
binoculars
to
find
out
where
enemies
are


they
are
used
to
defend
their
country
or
attack
another
country
army


it
is
difficult
and
a
soldier
must
be
in
good
shape
both
physically
and
mentally


they
almost
always
move
together
and
that
way
the
team
can
do
more
things
in
a
safer
way


they
may
be
assigned
to
certain
places
to
guard
or
they
may
be
told
to
search
a
place
or
even
attack
it


that
is
up
to
their
commander


every
soldier
answers
to
someone
else
so
that
way
everything
is
organized


working
in
the
army
and
wearing
the
uniform
is
called
service


a
soldier
will
never
say
i
work
as
a
sergeant
in
the
<collocation>signal corps</collocation>
but
always
i
serve
as
a
sergeant
in
the
<collocation>signal corps</collocation>
no
matter
what
his
or
her
rank
may
be


only
the
civilian
workers
who
do
not
wear
uniform
speak
about
working
in
the
army

discipline
the
function
of
the
army
is
based
on
discipline


that
means
that
every
soldier
will
unquestionably
carry
out
the
orders
which
he
or
she
has
received
and
will
obey
his
or
her
superior
officer
or
officer


there
is
only
one
exception
orders
which
violate
the
<collocation>human rights</collocation>
or
international
law
must
not
be
obeyed
as
it
is
considered
a
war
crime


the
chain
of
command
is
expressed
by
the
military
rank
system
and
hierarchy


gear
a
soldier
is
supplied
with
weapons
such
as
guns
knives
and
other
simple
gear
for
surviving
in
the
battlefield
such
as
food
water
clothes
and
tents


they
must
keep
good
care
of
the
items


some
soldiers
train
to
be
a
doctor
for
the
army
or
other
civilian
duties


qualifications
before
a
soldier
joins
the
army
he
must
qualify
to
be
in
it
first


the
person
is
put
through
tests
so
that
the
army
will
know
if
the
recruit
can
do
it
or
not


this
is
sometimes
called
boot
camp


he
must
complete
mental
tests
and
physical
tests


it
depends
on
where
he
is
testing
that
will
tell
him
how
hard
it
will
be


he
will
also
take
tests
to
determine
what
job
he
will
do
in
the
military


for
instance
he
may
work
with
computers
and
be
a
member
of
the
<collocation>signal corps</collocation>
or
be
a
cook
for
the
soldiers
he
may
have
been
a
construction
worker
in
civilian
life
and
be
a
military
engineer
he
may
become
a
truck
driver
and
serve
in
logistics
or
he
may
be
very
good
with
a
rifle
and
be
a
sniper
in
the
infantry
