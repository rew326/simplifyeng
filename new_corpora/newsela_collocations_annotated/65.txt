automobile
companies
have
sold
many


they
make
more
profit
on
them
per
vehicle
than
with
other
automobiles
because
they
are
cheaper
and
simpler
to
build
than
many
passenger
cars
of
equivalent
price


problems
many
people
have
bought
but
now
many
people
do
not
like
them
anymore
because
are
bad
for
the
environment
and
dangerous
to
other
drivers


in
addition
these
people
think
that
the
are
not
really
as
safe
as
people
believe
they
are


accidents
one
problem
with
is
that
they
roll
over
more
easily
than
lower
vehicles


in
recent
years
consumer
<collocation>reports magazine</collocation>
found
several
unacceptable
because
they
roll
over
too
easily


also
they
are
big
and
stiff
and
they
have
<collocation>high bumpers</collocation>
so
when
they
hit
another
car
the
other
car
and
its
passengers
can
be
severely
damaged


big
heavy
like
<collocation>ford excursions</collocation>
and
chevrolet
can
damage
cars
badly
when
they
hit
them


huge
gasoline
consumption
have
become
so
popular
in
the
united
states
that
the
is
using
much
more
gasoline
than
before


are
much
less
than
cars


the
main
reason
is
that
the
government
classifies
them
as
small
trucks
so
they
do
not
have
to
be
as
fuel
efficient
as
passenger
cars


since
auto
companies
have
little
reason
to
change
they
are


they
are
big
and
heavy
have
a
lot
of
wind
resistance
and
have
big
engines
and
a
heavy
suspension


they
also
use
tires
that
are
better
for
off
road
than
for
driving
on
the
street


smaller
that
look
like
cars
may
be
shorter
and
use
better
tires
but
they
still
have
big
polluting
engines


large
size
because
are
very
big
it
is
difficult
to
park
them


if
there
is
a
big
car
park
this
is
not
a
problem
but
in
some
places
like
<collocation>hong kong</collocation>
where
there
is
not
a
lot
of
space
it
is
a
problem

water

steam

problems
of
definition
the
main
problem
of
a
clear
definition
of
what
the
substance
is
that
if
for
example
to
consider
not
just
the
universe
cosmos
being
and
and
in
general
all
the
question
arises
what
is
the
constant
basic
principle
attribute
is
the
basis
of
the

generally
consists
of
all
that

of

in
modern
times
the
concept
of

is
treated
and
spread
widely


the

is
connected
with
an
ontological
understanding
of
substance
as
ultimate
bases

francis
bacon
benedict


central
category
of
metaphysics
in

substance
is
identified
as
with
god
and
with
nature

determined
as
the
cause
of
itself

the
main
characteristics

of
a

the
philosophy
of
benedict
substance
considered
in
the
light

second
point
of

the
substance

epistemological
understanding
of
the
concept

capabilities
and
the
need
for
scientific
knowledge
john

any

sound
can
also
mean
a
body
of
water
like
a
bay
or
channel


we
can
define
a
sound
wave
as
a
disturbance
which
travels
through
some
medium


sound
is
the
term
to
describe
what
is
heard
when
sound
waves
pass
through
a
medium
to
the
ear


all
sounds
are
made
by
vibrations
of
molecules
through
which
the
sound
travels


for
instance
when
a
drum
or
a
cymbal
is
struck
the
object
vibrates


these
vibrations
make
air
molecules
move


sound
waves
move
away
from
their
source
where
they
came
from
traveling
on
the
air
molecules


when
the
vibrating
air
molecules
reach
our
ears
the
eardrum
vibrates
too


the
bones
of
the
ear
vibrate
in
the
same
way
that
of
the
object
that
started
the
sound
wave


these
vibrations
let
you
hear
different
sounds


even
music
is
vibrations


irregular
vibrations
are
noise


sound
waves
have
two
parts
compression
and


compression
is
the
part
of
the
sound
waves
where
the
molecules
of
air
are
pushed
compressed
together


is
the
part
of
the
waves
where
the
molecules
are
far
away
from
each
other


sound
waves
are
a
sequence
of
compressions
and


contents
the
speed
of
sound

and
intensity

and
not
seen

<collocation>doppler effect</collocation>

the
speed
of
sound
main
speed
of
sound
sound
waves
can
travel
through
solids
liquids
and
gases
but
it
can
not
travel
through
a
vacuum
a
place
with
nothing
in
it


this
is
why
astronauts
can
not
talk
to
each
other
in
space
they
need
a
radio
to
hear
each
other


sound
can
travel
through
water
faster
than
through
air
and
they
travel
even
faster
in
solids
like
stone
iron
and
steel


sound
travels
at
metres
feet
per
second
in
the
air


pitch
and
intensity
pitch
is
the
highness
or
lowness
of
sound


pitch
is
how
humans
hear
different
frequencies


frequency
is
determined
by
the
number
of
vibrations
per
second


the
highest
key
on
a
piano
for
instance
vibrates
times
per
second


it
has
a
frequency
of
hertz
or
kilohertz


lower
keys
have
lower
frequencies


a
note
an
<collocation>octave higher</collocation>
than
another
note
has
twice
the
frequency
of
that
note


the
intensity
of
a
sound
is
how
much
sound
energy
goes
through
a
square
meter
in
one
second


sound
waves
with
higher
amplitude
bigger
vibration
have
higher
intensity


the
intensity
of
a
sound
is
higher
closer
to
the
sound
source


farther
away
it
less
intense


the
inverse
square
law
shows
how
sound
intensity
becomes
smaller
farther
from
the
sound
source


inverse
square
says
that
when
distance
gets
multiplied
by
a
number
sound
intensity
gets
divided
by
that
number
squared
the
number
times
itself


thus
twice
the
distance
means
a
quarter
the
intensity


sound
can
be
very
different


they
can
range
from
which
are
barely
heard
to
painfully
loud
