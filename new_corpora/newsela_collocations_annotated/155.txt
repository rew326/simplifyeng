a
beaker
is
usually
about
the
same
width
as
its
height


this
makes
beakers
very
stable
and
easy
to
handle


they
may
be
made
of

have
marks
on
them

hold
these

not
be
used

are
often
used
to

properties
lithium
is
one
of
the
alkali
metals


lithium
is
a
silvery
solid
metal
when
freshly
cut


it
is
very
soft


thus
it
can
be
cut
easily
with
a
knife


it
melts
at
a
low
temperature


it
is
very
light
similar
to
wood


it
is
the
least
dense
metal
and
the
least
dense
element
in
a
solid
or
liquid
state


it
can
hold
more
heat
than
any
other
solid
element


it
conducts
heat
and
electricity
easily


chemical
properties
it
will
react
with
water
giving
off
hydrogen
to
form
a
basic
solution
<collocation>lithium hydroxide</collocation>


because
of
this
lithium
must
be
stored
in
petroleum
jelly


sodium
and
potassium
can
be
stored
in
oil
but
lithium
can
not
because
it
is
so
light


it
will
just
float
on
the
oil
and
not
be
protected
by
it


lithium
also
reacts
with
halogens


it
can
react
with
nitrogen
gas
to
make
lithium


it
reacts
with
air
to
make
a
black
tarnish
and
then
a
white
powder
of
<collocation>lithium hydroxide</collocation>
and
<collocation>lithium carbonate</collocation>

in
christian
observed
that
lithium
salts
give
a
bright
red
color
in
flame


and
sir
davy
later
used
electrolysis
on
lithium
oxide
to
isolate
the
element


lithium
was
used
first
in
greases


then
nuclear
weapons
became
a
big
use
of
lithium


lithium
was
also
used
to
make
glass
melt
easier
and
make
<collocation>aluminium oxide</collocation>
melt
easier
in
making
aluminium


now
lithium
is
used
mainly
in
batteries


it
was
apparently
given
the
name
lithium
because
it
was
discovered
from
a
mineral
while
other
common
alkali
metals
were
first
discovered
in
plant
tissue


preparation
it
is
made
by
getting
lithium
chloride
from
pools
and
springs


the
lithium
chloride
is
melted
and


this
makes
liquid
lithium
and
chlorine


uses

its
main
use
is
in

lithium
is
used
as
an

<collocation>data compression</collocation>
is
a
set
of
steps
for
packing
data
into
a
smaller
space
while
allowing
for
the
original
data
to
be
seen
again


compression
is
a
process
a
<collocation>compression algorithm</collocation>
can
be
used
to
make
a
data
package
smaller
but
it
can
also
be
run
the
other
way
to
decompress
the
package
into
its
original
form


<collocation>data compression</collocation>
is
useful
in
computing
to
save
disk
space
or
to
reduce
the
bandwidth
used
when
sending
data
over
the
internet

examples

compression
compression
packs
data
in
such
a
way
that
the
compressed
package
can
be
decompressed
and
the
data
can
be
pulled
out
exactly
the
same
as
it
went
in


this
is
very
important
for
computer
programs
and
archives
since
even
a
very
small
change
in
a
computer
program
will
make
it
unusable


this
type
of
compression
works
by
reducing
how
much
waste
space
is
in
a
piece
of
data


for
example
if
you
receive
a
data
package
which
contains
you
could
compress
that
into
which
has
the
same
meaning
but
takes
up
less
space


this
type
of
compression
is
called
encoding
because
you
define
how
long
the
run
of
a
character
is


in
the
above
example
there
are
two
runs
a
run
of
a
and
another
of
b


the
problem
with
encoding
is
that
it
only
works
on
long
pieces
of
the
same
value
of
data


if
you
receive
a
package
with
inside
that
can
be
compressed
into
but
that
longer
than
the
original


in
this
case
there
another
method
that
can
be
used
checking
how
often
a
particular
value
comes
up
in
the
whole
data
package


this
is
often
called
frequency
compression


the
most
common
kind
of
frequency
compression
is
called
coding
after
the
scientist
who
came
up
with
the
idea


the
basic
plan
is
to
give
each
distinct
value
in
a
piece
of
data
a
code
values
that
crop
up
all
the
time
get
shorter
codes
and
values
that
only
show
up
once
or
twice
get
longer
codes

compression
for
some
types
of
data
compression
can
go
a
lot
further
this
is
most
often
the
case
with
media
files
like
music
and
images


compression
throws
out
some
of
the
data
so
that
there
less
to
store


beyond
a
certain
level
of
detail
or
past
a
particularly
high
tone
people
do
not
notice
if
the
information
is
missing


as
a
result
it
can
simply
be
removed
from
the
data


of
course
this
will
not
work
for
computer
programs
and
other
such
data
where
every
piece
is
important
throwing
away
large
pieces
of
a
computer
program
is
generally
unhealthy
for
the
program

a
compiler
is
a
program
that
takes
source
code
and
translates
it
into
a
more
basic
language


these
simpler
languages
are
either
assembly
language
or
machine
code


the
action
of
translating
the
programming
language
code
is
called
compiling


code
that
has
been
simplified
is
called
compiled
code


for
many
programmers
using
a
compiler
is
easier
than
writing
the
machine
code
themselves
because
there
are
many
different
machine
codes
it
can
take
a
long
time
to
write
for
each
of
the
machine
codes


for
example
the
gnu
c
compiler
compiles
c
into
machine
code


compiling
the
language
as
shown
in
the
diagram
at
right
the
source
code
of
a
computer
program
is
read
by
a
analyzer
which
splits
the
text
into
words
and
symbols
known
as
tokens


the
tokens
are
analyzed
by
a
parser
which
looks
for
<collocation>grammatical patterns</collocation>
in
the
use
of
the
tokens


the
parser
collects
the
language
data
for
an
generator
to
convert
the
data
into
that
form
of
coding


an
reads
the
intermediate
code
which
was
generated
from
the
parser
data
and
simplifies
or
extra
code
to
write
a
language
text
which
is
then
changed
into
the
target
computer
machine
code


variants
at
the
end
of
each
compilation
step
the
partial
finished
product
could
be
stored
and
then
only
processed
later
on


a
language
like
java
uses
this
successfully
where
they
lack
the
final
translation
step
to
instructions
the
processor
understands


they
only
do
the
final
translation
step
once
the
java
program
is
running
on
a
computer


this
is
either
called
interpreting
or
ting
depending
on
the
used
technique


example
for
example
the
source
code
might
contain
an
equation
such
as
x


the
analyzer
would
separate
each
number
and
symbol
such
as
or
into
separate
tokens


the
parser
would
note
the
pattern
of
tokens
as
being
an
equation


the
generator
would
write
a
form
of
coding
which
defines
a
storage
variable
named
x
and
assigns
the
numerical
product
of
plus
and


the
would
simplify
the
calculation
of
as
being
just


hence
the
target
generator
would
set
a
variable
named
x
and
put
the
value
into
that
storage
place
in
the
computer
memory
using
the
instructions
of
whichever
computer
chip
is
being
used

ten

of
eyes
are
known


most
ways

at

once


one
way
to
<collocation>categorize eyes</collocation>
is
to
look
at
the
number
of
chambers


simple
eyes
are
made
of
only
one
concave
chamber
perhaps
with
a
lens


<collocation>compound eyes</collocation>
have
many
such
chambers
with
their
lenses
on
a
convex
surface


eyes
also
can
be
grouped
according
to
how
the
is
made


are
either
or


and
some
possess
both


simple
<collocation>eyes pit</collocation>
<collocation>eyes pit</collocation>
eyes
are
set
in
a
depression
in
the
skin


this
reduces
the
angles
at
which
light
can
enter


it
allows
the
organism
to
say
where
the
light
is
coming
from


such
eyes
can
be
found
in
about
of
phyla


they
probably
came
before
the
development
of
more
complex
eyes


pit
eyes
are
small


they
are
made
of
up
to
about
hundred
cells
covering
about


the
directionality
can
be
improved
by
reducing
the
size
of
the
opening
and
by
putting
a
reflective
layer
behind
the
receptor
cells

have
a
pinhole
eye
the
pinhole
eye
is
an
advanced
form
of
pit
eye


it
has
several
bits
most
notably
a

aperture
and
deep
pit


sometimes
the
aperture
can
be
changed


it
is
only
found
in

spherical
eye
the
resolution
of
pit
eyes
can
be
improved
a
lot
by
adding
a
material
to
make
a
lens


this
will
reduce
the
radius
of
the
blurring
and
increase
the
resolution
that
can
be
achieved


the
most
basic
form
can
still
be
seen
in
some
and


these
eyes
have
a
lens
of
one
refractive
index


it
is
possible
to
get
a
better
image
with
materials
that
have
a
high
refractive
index
which
decreases
towards
the
edges


this
decreases
the
<collocation>focal length</collocation>
and
allows
a
sharp
image
to
form
on
the
retina


this
eye
creates
an
image
that
is
sharp
enough
that
motion
of
the
eye
can
cause
significant
blurring


to
minimize
the
effect
of
eye
motion
while
the
animal
moves
most
such
eyes
have
stabilizing
eye
muscles


the
of
insects
have
a
simple
lens
but
their
focal
point
always
lies
behind
the
retina


they
can
never
form
a
sharp
image


this
limits
the
function
of
the
eye


eyes
of
arthropods
blur
the
image
across
the
whole
retina


they
are
very
good
at
responding
to
rapid
changes
in
light
intensity
across
the
whole
visual
field
this
fast
response
is
accelerated
even
more
by
the
large
nerve
bundles
which
rush
the
information
to
the
brain


focusing
the
image
would
also
cause
the
sun
image
to
be
focused
on
a
few
receptors


these
could
possibly
be
damaged
by
the
intense
light
shielding
the
receptors
would
block
out
some
light
and
reduce
their
sensitivity


this
fast
response
has
led
to
suggestions
that
the
of
insects
are
used
mainly
in
flight
because
they
can
be
used
to
detect
sudden
changes
in
which
way
is
up
because
light
especially
light
which
is
absorbed
by
vegetation
usually
comes
from
above


refractive
cornea
the
eyes
of
most
vertebrates
as
well
as
those
of
some
spiders
and
insect
larvae
contain
a
fluid
that
has
a
higher
refractive
index
than
the
air


that
way
the
lens
does
not
have
to
reduce
the
<collocation>focal length</collocation>
because
this
is
done
by
the
fluid


that
way
the
lens
can
adjust
the
focus
more
easily


that
way
a
very
high
resolution
can
be
obtained


<collocation>reflector eyes</collocation>
instead
of
using
a
lens
it
is
also
possible
to
have
cells
inside
the
eye
that
act
like
mirrors


the
image
can
then
be
reflected
to
focus
at
a
central
point


this
design
also
means
that
someone
looking
into
such
an
eye
will
see
the
same
image
as
the
organism
which
has
them


many
small
organisms
such
as
and
use
such
this
design
but
their
eyes
are
too
small
to
produce
usable
images
