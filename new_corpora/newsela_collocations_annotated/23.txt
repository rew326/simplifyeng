the
earliest
known
was
called


much
later
there
was
a
time
the
when
the
earth
was
almost
entirely
covered
by
thick
ice
sheets
glaciers


this
is
called
the
snowball
earth
theory


what
it
is
made
of
a
rough
comparison
of
the
size
of
earth
and
the
other
large
rocks
in
our
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
mercury
venus
and
mars


the
earth
is
rocky


it
is
the
largest
of
the
rocky
planets
moving
around
the
sun
by
mass
and
by
size


it
is
still
much
much
smaller
than
the
gas
planets
such
as
jupiter
though


chemical
over
all
the
earth
is
made
of
iron
oxygen
silicon
magnesium
sulfur
nickel
calcium
and
aluminium


the
left
over
is
made
of
many
different
kinds
of
other
chemicals


chemicals
that
are
very
uncommon
such
as
gold
and
platinum
can
be
very
valuable


the
structure
of
the
earth
changes
from
the
inside
to
the
outside


the
center
of
the
earth
the
core
is
mostly
iron
nickel
sulfur
and
less
than
other
things


the
surface
the
crust
is
largely
oxygen


oxygen
is
normally
a
gas
but
it
can
join
with
other
chemicals
to
make
compounds
like
water
and
rocks


of
rocks
have
oxygen
in
them


the
most
common
oxygen
having
rocks
are
silica
made
with
silicon
made
with
aluminum
rust
made
with
iron
lime
made
with
calcium
magnesia
made
with
magnesium
potash
made
with
potassium
and
soda
made
with
sodium
but
there
are
others
as
well


shape
the
earth
shape
is
a
ball
that
is
a
little
squashed
on
the
top
and
bottom


this
is
because
the
earth
turns
around
itself
very
quickly
pushing
the
middle
out
a
little
and
pulling
the
top
and
bottom
in
a
little


the
equator
the
line
around
the
middle
of
the
earth
is
about
convert
km
mi
sp
us
or
long
and
generally
the
earth
is
about
convert
km
mi
sp
us
or
wide
though
again
that
changes
a
little
when
you
go
from
the
top
or
bottom
to
the
middle


when
you
make
an
overall
comparison
the
earth
looks
very
very
round
but
because
the
earth
is
so
big
the
highest
mountain
above
sea
level
the
<collocation>mount everest</collocation>
which
is
convert
km
mi
sp
us
on
or
above
sea
level
is
not
actually
the
one
that
is
the
farthest
away
from
the
center
of
the
earth


instead
the
sleeping
volcano
mount
in
ecuador
is
it
is
only
convert
km
mi
sp
us
on
or
above
sea
level
but
it
is
almost
at
the
equator


because
of
this
mount
is
convert
km
mi
sp
us
on
or
from
the
center
of
the
earth
while
<collocation>mount everest</collocation>
is
convert
km
mi
sp
us
or
closer
to
it


similarly
the
lowest
point
below
sea
level
that
we
are
conscious
of
is
the
<collocation>challenger deep</collocation>
in
the
mariana
trench
in
the
pacific
ocean


it
is
about
convert
km
mi
sp
us
on
or
below
sea
level
but
again
there
are
probably
places
at
the
bottom
of
the
arctic
ocean
that
are
nearer
to
the
center
of
the
earth


what
it
is
like
inside
a
picture
of
the
inside
of
the
earth
showing
the
different
levels


in
fact
the
air
and
the
outside
levels
are
<collocation>much thinner</collocation>
than
shown
here
the
deepest
hole
ever
dug
is
only
about
convert
km
mi
or
sp
us


we
know
a
lot
about
the
inside
of
the
earth
though
because
we
can
learn
things
from
earthquakes
and
the
times
when
volcanoes
erupt


we
are
able
to
see
how
quickly
the
shock
waves
move
through
the
earth
in
different
places


the
inside
of
the
earth
is
very
different
from
the
outside


almost
all
of
earth
liquid
water
is
in
the
seas
or
close
to
the
surface


the
surface
also
has
a
lot
of
oxygen
which
comes
from
plants


small
and
simple
kinds
of
life
can
live
far
under
the
earth
but
animals
and
plants
only
live
on
the
surface
or
in
the
seas


the
rocks
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
the
crust
are
well
known


they
are
thicker
where
there
is
land
between
convert
to
km
mi
or
sp
us
on
thick


under
the
seas
they
are
sometimes
only
convert
km
mi
or
sp
us
on
thick


there
are
three
groups
of
rocks
that
make
up
most
of
the
outside
of
the
earth


some
rock
is
made
when
the
hot
liquid
rock
comes
from
inside
the
earth
igneous
rocks
another
type
of
rock
is
made
when
sediment
is
laid
down
usually
under
the
sea
sedimentary
rocks
and
a
third
kind
of
rock
is
made
when
the
other
two
are
changed
by
very
high
temperature
or
pressure
<collocation>metamorphic rocks</collocation>


a
very
few
rocks
also
fall
out
of
the
sky
meteorites


below
the
crust
is
warm
and
almost
liquid
rock
that
is
always
moving
around
the
mantle


then
there
is
a
thin
liquid
layer
of
very
heated
rock
the
outer
core


this
is
very
hot
convert
c
f
or


the
middle
of
the
inside
of
the
earth
would
be
liquid
as
well
but
all
the
weight
of
the
rock
above
it
pushes
it
back
into
being
solid


this
solid
middle
part
the
inner
core
is
almost
all
iron


this
is
what
makes
the
earth
magnetic


pieces
moving
around
a
picture
showing
the
earth
largest
and
most
important
plates


main
plate
tectonics
the
earth
crust
is
solid
but
made
of
parts
which
move
very
slowly


the
thin
level
of
hard
rock
on
the
outside
of
the
earth
rests
on
hot
liquid
material
below
it
in
the
deeper
mantle


this
liquid
material
moves
because
it
gets
heat
from
the
hot
center
of
the
earth


the
slow
movement
of
the
plates
is
what
makes
causes
earthquakes
volcanoes
and
large
groups
of
mountains
on
the
earth


there
are
three
ways
plates
can
come
together


two
plates
can
move
towards
each
other
convergent
plate
edges


this
can
form
islands
such
as
japan
burning
mountains
and
high
mountain
ranges
such
as
the
andes
and
himalayas


two
plates
can
move
away
from
each
other
divergent
plate
edges


this
gives
the
warm
liquid
rock
inside
the
earth
a
place
to
come
out


this
makes
special
mountain
ranges
below
the
sea
or
large
low
lands
like
africa
great
rift
valley


plates
are
able
to
move
beside
each
other
as
well
transform
plate
edges
such
as
the
san
fault


this
makes
their
edges
crush
against
each
other
and
makes
many
shocks
as
they
move


what
it
like
outside
the
outside
of
the
earth
is
not
even


there
are
high
pointed
places
named
mountains
and
high
flat
places
named
plateaus
there
are
large
low
places
called
valleys
and
thin
low
places
called
canyons


for
the
most
part
moving
air
and
water
from
the
sky
and
<collocation>seas damages</collocation>
rocks
in
high
places
and
breaks
them
into
small
pieces
the
air
and
water
then
move
these
pieces
to
lower
places


the
largest
of
these
places
are
named
plains
and
are
very
important
for
growing
food
and
building
great
towns


many
persons
live
in
the
large
plains
of
china
and
india
for
example


because
of
this
the
earth
would
have
all
been
very
flat
a
long
time
before
now
but
the
moving
plates
discussed
above
make
new
high
places
before
that
is
able
to
come
about


all
of
the
high
and
low
places
on
earth
are
made
of
or
are
on
top
of
rocks


the
different
kinds
of
these
rocks
was
discussed
above


the
outside
of
the
earth
is
usually
not
uncovered
rock
though


over
of
the
earth
is
covered
by
seas
full
of
salty
water


this
salty
water
makes
up
about
of
all
earth
water


the
fresh
water
persons
can
drink
is
mostly
ice


only
a
very
small
amount
is
at
hand
in
rivers
and
under
the
earth
for
men
and
women
to
drink
and
use


the
air
above
the
earth
stops
the
water
from
going
away
into
outer
space


as
well
there
have
been
so
many
living
things
for
such
a
long
time
that
much
of
the
land
on
earth
is
covered
with
plants
or
with
what
is
left
from
earlier
living
things


places
with
very
little
rain
are
dry
wastes
named
deserts
these
normally
have
very
few
living
things
but
life
is
able
to
grow
very
quickly
when
these
wastes
have
an
<collocation>uncommon rainfall</collocation>


places
with
large
amounts
of
rain
are
almost
always
large
woods
these
sometimes
have
so
many
trees
that
their
leaves
stop
all
the
sun
light
from
being
able
to
get
to
the
earth
at
all


lately
persons
have
also
changed
the
outside
of
the
earth
a
great
amount
see
below


air
main
atmosphere
all
around
the
earth
is
a
large
amount
of
air
the
atmosphere


the
mass
of
the
earth
pulls
the
gasses
in
the
air
down
and
does
not
let
them
go
into
outer
space


the
air
is
mostly
made
of
nitrogen
about
and
oxygen
about
but
there
are
a
few
other
gasses
as
well


most
living
things
need
the
air
or
parts
of
the
air
gripped
in
the
water
to
breathe
and
live


they
use
the
gasses
specially
oxygen
and
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
to
make
and
use
sugar
and
to
give
themselves
power


the
air
animals
and
plants
use
to
live
is
only
the
first
level
of
the
air
around
the
earth
the


the
day
to
day
changes
in
this
level
of
air
are
named
weather
the
changes
between
places
far
away
from
each
other
and
from
year
to
year
are
named
the
climate


rain
and
storms
are
both
in
this
level


both
come
about
because
this
part
of
the
air
gets
colder
as
it
goes
up


cold
air
becomes
thicker
and
falls
and
warm
air
becomes
thinner
and
goes
up


the
turning
earth
moves
the
air
as
well
and
air
moves
north
and
south
because
the
middle
of
the
earth
generally
gets
more
power
from
the
sun
and
is
warmer
than
the
north
and
south
points


at
the
same
time
air
over
water
specially
very
warm
water
gets
water
in
it
but
because
cold
air
is
not
able
to
take
in
as
much
water
it
starts
to
make
clouds
and
rain
as
it
gets
colder


the
way
water
moves
around
in
a
circle
like
this
is
called
the
water
cycle


above
this
first
level
there
are
four
other
levels


the
air
gets
colder
as
it
goes
up
in
the
first
level
in
the
second
level
the
stratosphere
the
air
gets
warmer
as
it
goes
up


this
level
has
a
special
kind
of
oxygen
named
ozone


the
ozone
in
this
air
keeps
living
things
safe
from
<collocation>damaging rays</collocation>
from
the
sun


the
power
from
these
rays
is
what
makes
this
level
warmer
and
warmer


the
middle
level
the
mesosphere
gets
colder
and
colder
with
height
the
fourth
level
the
gets
warmer
and
warmer
and
the
last
level
the
is
almost
outer
space
and
has
very
little
air
at
all


it
reaches
about
half
the
way
to
the
moon


the
three
outer
levels
have
a
lot
of
electric
power
moving
through
them
this
is
called
the
ionosphere
and
is
important
for
radio
and
other
electric
waves
in
the
air


it
is
also
where
the
northern
lights
are


even
though
air
seems
very
light
the
weight
of
all
of
the
air
above
the
outside
of
the
earth
air
pressure
is
important


generally
from
sea
level
to
the
top
of
the
outer
level
of
the
air
a
space
of
air
one
square
centimeter
across
has
a
mass
of
about
kg
and
a
space
of
air
one
square
inch
across
has
a
weight
of
about
pounds


the
mass
of
the
air
also
keeps
the
earth
safe
when
rocks
meteorites
hit
it
from
outer
space


without
the
air
the
damage
meteorites
do
would
be
much


because
of
the
air
meteorites
generally
burn
up
long
before
they
get
to
the
earth


the
air
also
keeps
the
earth
warm
specially
the
half
turned
away
from
the
sun


some
gasses
especially
methane
and
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
work
like
a
blanket
to
keep
things
warm


in
the
past
the
earth
has
been
much
warmer
and
much
colder
than
it
is
now


since
persons
have
grown
used
to
the
heat
we
have
now
though
we
do
not
want
the
earth
to
be
too
much
warmer
or
colder


most
of
the
ways
men
and
women
create
electric
power
use
burning
kinds
of
carbon
specially
coal
oil
and
natural
gas


burning
these
creates
new
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
and
can
cause
more
warming


a
large
discussion
is
going
on
now
about
what
men
and
women
should
do
about
the
earth
latest
warming
which
has
gone
on
for
about
years


so
far
this
warming
has
been
good
for
persons
plants
have
grown
better
and
the
weather
has
been
better
than
when
it
was
colder
before


some
persons
who
learn
about
science
though
say
that
many
bad
things
will
possibly
come
about
if
the
warming
goes
on


people
main
human
about
billion
people
live
on
earth


they
live
in
about
different
lands
called
countries


some
like
russia
are
large
with
many
large
cities


others
like
the
vatican
are
small


the
five
countries
with
the
most
people
are
china
india
the
united
states
indonesia
and
brazil


about
of
people
live
in
the
north
half
of
the
world
which
has
most
of
the
land


scientists
think
that
people
originally
came
from
africa


now
of
all
people
do
not
live
in
africa
but
in
europe
and
asia


people
change
the
earth
in
many
ways


they
have
been
able
to
grow
plants
for
food
and
clothes
for
about
ten
thousand
years


when
there
was
enough
food
they
were
able
to
build
towns
and
cities


near
these
places
men
and
women
were
able
to
change
rivers
bring
water
to
farms
and
stop
floods
rising
water
from
coming
over
their
land


people
found
useful
animals
and
bred
them
so
they
were
easier
to
keep


science
and
industry
have
given
men
and
women
much
better
health
and
much
more
power
now
even
poor
people
can
live
with
much
more
comfort
and
less
pain
than
before

an
experiment
is
a
test
of
an
idea
or
a
method


it
is
often
used
by
scientists
and
engineers


an
experiment
is
used
to
see
how
well
the
idea
matches
the
real
world


experiments
have
been
used
for
many
years
to
help
people
understand
the
world
around
them


experiments
can
tell
us
if
a
theory
is
false
or
if
something
does
not
work


they
can
not
tell
us
if
a
theory
is
true


when
einstein
said
that
gravity
could
affect
light
it
took
a
few
years
before
astronomers
could
test
it


general
relativity
predicts
that
the
path
of
light
is
bent
in
a
gravitational
field
light
passing
a
massive
body
is
deflected
towards
that
body


this
effect
has
been
confirmed
by
observing
the
light
of
stars
or
distant
quasars
being
deflected
as
it
passes
the
sun


now
a
<collocation>hundred years</collocation>
or
so
after
einstein
published
his
ideas
there
have
been
many
tests
all
of
which
have
been
consistent
with

it

logically
speaking
what
we
test
are
implications
of

theory
because
the

ethics
is
the
part
of
philosophy
that
deals
with
good
and
evil


ethics
tries
to
answer
questions
like
what
actions
are
good


what
actions
are
evil


how
can
we
tell
the
difference


are
good
and
evil
the
same
for
everyone


how
should
we
make
hard
decisions
that
might
help
or
hurt
other
people


how
do
our
actions
affect
others


ideas
about
ethics
some
philosophers
call
ethics
the
science
of
morality


morality
is
what
someone
thinks
or
feels
is
good
or
bad


there
are
many
different
moralities
but
they
share
some
things


for
example
most
people
think
that
murder
killing
somebody
is
wrong


compare
exodus
some
philosophers
have
hope
to
find
more
things
that
<collocation>moralities share</collocation>


they
think
that
ethics
should
use
the
scientific
method
to
study
things
that
people
think
are
good
or
bad


their
work
can
be
used
to
test
the
fairness
of
a
situation
such
as
how
people
should
treat
each
other


an
example
of
this
kind
of
thinking
is
the
categorical
imperative


many
countries
have
laws
based
on
this
idea
of
fairness


other
philosophers
fact
date
december
think
that
ethics
is
separate
from
morality


they
do
not
think
that
ethics
can
be
studied
using
the
scientific
method
and
they
think
it
is
closer
to
metaphysics


some
of
them
think
like
about
what
is
good
and
bad


some
philosophers
fact
date
december
believe
that
ethics
is
subjective


this
means
that
they
think
that
what
is
right
for
me
is
whatever
i
say
is
right


these
philosophers
do
not
think
that
ethics
is
the
same
for
all
people


what
is
ethics
used
for


understanding
ethics
can
help
people
decide
what
to
do
when
they
have
choices


many
philosophers
think
that
doing
anything
or
making
any
choice
is
a
part
of
ethics


ethics
is
part
of
other
fields
of
study
in
many
ways


here
are
some
ways
ethics
is
part
of
the
study
of
religion


in
religion
people
often
learn
what
is
good
or
bad
from
what
they
believe
about
god
or
gods


some
important
ideas
about
what
is
good
or
bad
have
come
from
religion


see
ten
commandments


some
theories
of
economics
say
ethics
has
to
do
with
money


money
is
a
big
part
of
most
people
lives


thinking
about
morality
can
be
important
in
economics


for
example
there
is
a
saying
about
ethics
taken
from
the
bible
that
the
love
of
money
is
the
root
of
all
kinds
of
evil
timothy


the
philosophy
of
marxism
also
says
that
a
few
people
using
money
in
the
wrong
way
can
hurt
many
other
people


government
policy
can
be
affected
by
what
politicians
think
is
ethical


politicians
try
to
create
laws
that
help
everyone
do
what
is
right


<collocation>political debates</collocation>
happen
when
the
people
who
make
public
policy
do
not
agree
about
what
is
right


in
work
thinking
about
ethics
can
help
with
hard
questions


work
can
be
like
both
economics
and
politics


workers
have
to
make
money
and
follow
laws


but
the
best
way
to
do
both
is
not
always
easy
to
know


the
study
of
this
is
called
business
ethics
people
like
doctors
and
nurses
have
to
make
hard
choices
about
how
to
care
for
people


sometimes
the
person
being
cared
for
their
family
or
the
doctor
do
not
agree
what
is
best
for
them


also
choices
have
to
be
made
if
there
is
not
enough
money
for
all
people
to
get
the
help
they
need


the
study
of
this
is
called
medical
ethics
discussing
ethics
can
also
be
a
way
to
stop
people
fighting
or
starting
a
war


by
talking
about
ethics
people
hope
to
get
what
they
want
without
being
violent


this
works
when
all
people
agree
that
peace
is
very
important


but
not
everyone
agrees
about
what
is
right
or
wrong


so
sometimes
anger
can
make
it
hard
to
talk
without
fighting


along
with
aesthetics
ethics
forms
part
of
the
philosophy
of
what
people
like
