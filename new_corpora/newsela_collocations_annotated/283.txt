they
eat
other
tadpoles
if
food
is
nowhere
to
be
found


the
eggs
of
the
toad
hatches
in
three
days


their
tadpoles
complete
their
metamorphosis
in
six
to
eight
days


this
is
because
toads
lay
their
eggs
in
places
where
water
will
dry
up
soon


tadpoles
of
frogs
and
toads
start
to
grow
their
back
legs
first


they
then
grow
front
legs
a
few
weeks
later


when
tadpoles
grow
their
limbs
they
are
called


this
is
because
they
look
rather
like
a
smaller
version
of
adult
frogs
and
toads


tadpoles
will
also
start
to
grow
a
backbone
after
growing
their
front
limbs


after
this
their
mouths
get
bigger
and
their
eyes
will
stick
out
more


after
a
tadpole
has
grown
its
hands
their
tails
continue
to
get
shorter
until
there
is
nothing
left
of
them


habitats
most
frogs
like
to
spend
their
time
in
the
water
hiding
near
aquatic
plants


this
alpine
newt
is
basking
on
a
rock


it
does
this
to
get
heat
from
the
sun


salamanders
and
can
be
found
living
in
streams


salamanders
can
be
found
in
rotten
logs
holes
or
underground
places
that
are
wet
such
as
under
leaves


salamanders
live
in
habitats
where
there
are
a
lot
of
rocks


they
like
to
hide
under
rocks
and
stones


the
tailed
frogs
like
to
live
in
cold
water
habitats


in
their
habitat
amphibians
like
to
live
where
there
are
a
lot
of
places
to
hide


these
include
nearby
small
trees
logs
and
plants


while
underwater
they
like
to
hide
near
aquatic
plants
and
rocks


tree
and
dart
frogs
like
to
live
in
forests
on
trees
plants
and
on
the
ground
under
leaves


some
can
be
found
living
in
the
desert
or
the
arctic


the
desert
lives
in
the
desert


they
are
only
active
at
night
when
temperatures
are
much
cooler


it
rarely
rains
in
the
desert
and
because
of
this
desert
frogs
will
burrow
to
keep
cool


they
use
their
mucus
to
keep
them
wet


they
will
spread
it
all
over
their
bodies


the
mucus
will
harden
to
keep
the
water
it
produces
from
escaping


once
the
desert
frog
has
done
this
it
will
stay
in
its
cocoon
and
will
not
move


they
will
stay
like
this
for
several
months
to
years
until
a
rainstorm


desert
frogs
and
toads
lose
water
more
quickly


the
toad
will
spit
on
the
ground


once
they
have
done
this
they
will
lay
on
it


their
bodies
will
take
in
the
water


their
bodies
are
thin
and
have
a
lot
of
blood
vessels
this
helps
them
to
be
able
to
take
water
through
their
skin


the
california
newt
can
survive
a
fire
by
spreading
its
mucous
over
its
body


arctic
frogs
such
as
the
wood
frog
moor
frog
and
the
common
frog
has
to
live
with
freezing
temperatures
for
a
long
time


they
will
burrow
in
places
where
they
can
get
into
a
cocoon


like
every
living
organisms
amphibians
must
have
water
to
survive


amphibians
however
need
freshwater


some
frogs
such
as
burrowing
frogs
can
keep
water
in
their
bladders


this
allows
them
to
stay
underground
without
drying
up


the
frog
lives
near
water
that
is
somewhat
salty


they
will
eat
saltwater
crabs


torrent
salamanders
lives
in
cold
waters


because
of
this
they
have
shorter
lungs


short
lungs
helps
them
to
float
easily


distribution
are
though
restricted
in
distribution
by
their
need
for
moist
or
watery
habitats
to
reproduce


anatomy
skin
this
poison
dart
frog
skin
is
blue


this
color
warns
animals
that
they
are
toxic


most
amphibians
have
a
good
sense
of
smell


their
eyes
have
color
and
clear
vision


many
have
secretions
in
their
skin
which
makes
them
toxic


they
do
not
produce
toxins
themselves


they
get
toxins
from
what
they
eat


they
eat
insects
in
their
habitat


these
insects
get
the
poison
from
a
plant


the
toxin
has
been
discovered
in
beetles


this
means
that
they
are
likely
the
cause
of
poisons
found
in
amphibians


amphibians
do
not
produce
in
captivity
which
means
that
it
is
not
harmful
to
touch
them


the
american
indian
tribe
used
the
toxins
of
the
arrow
dart
frogs
when
hunting


in
the
genus
has
a
poison
called
tetrodotoxin
a
neurotoxin


scientists
believe
that
toxins
in
are
caused
by
bacteria
in
the
genera
pseudomonas
and


because
of
this
the
do
not
have
a
lot
of
predators


however
some
species
of
snakes
have
develop
a
resistance


this
means
that
they
can
eat
without
the
toxin
hurting
them


it
is
a
case
of


senses
and
skeletal
system
amphibians
eyes
have
lids
glands
and
ducts


they
have
good
color
vision
eyes
are
small
and
dark


most
of
them
are
blind


most
amphibians
have
a
good
sense
of
smell
even
underwater


the
skeletal
system
of
amphibians
are
similar
to
other
animals


they
have
a
spine
rib
cage
long
bones
such
as
the
humerus
and
femur


they
also
have
short
bones
such
as
the
phalanges
metacarpals
and
metatarsals


most
amphibians
have
four
limbs
except
for


the
bones
in
amphibians
are
hollow
and
do
not
weigh
much


diet
amphibians
are
predatory
animals


if
there
is
no
food
to
be
found
they
will
eat
each
other


amphibians
are
predatory
animals


they
mostly
eat
live
invertebrates
and
animals
that
do
not
move
too
quickly


these
include
caterpillars
earthworms
crayfish
water
beetles
snails
and
dragon
fly
larvae


many
amphibians
use
their
sticky
tongues
to
catch
their
prey


they
will
swallow
the
animal
whole
but
may
chew
it
just
a
bit
for
it
to
go
down
their
throats


the
family
and
the
genus
will
eat
almost
anything
they
can
fit
into
their
mouths


these
include
rodents
birds
ducklings
small
fish
and
small
mammals


most
frogs
are
cannibalistic
and
will
eat
each
other
if
food
is
no

some

they

the

been
decreasing

have
said
that
the
declining
of
amphibians
is
one
of
the
most
<collocation>critical threats</collocation>
to
<collocation>global biodiversity</collocation>


a

these
include
habitat
destruction
pollution
introduced

<collocation>climate change</collocation>
destruction
of

amphibians

the

body

oxygen
after

there
is
no
fundamental
difference
between
frogs
and
toads
and
they
are
not

separately


this
is
because
the
<collocation>toad lifestyle</collocation>
with
its
dry

skin
is
an
adaptation
to
living
in
drier
habitats


the

of
<collocation>convergent evolution</collocation>


frogs
can
live
on
land
and
in
fresh
water


they
can
not
survive
in
salt
water


their
development
is
by
metamorphosis


they
hatch
as
tadpoles
from
eggs
which
are
laid
by
a
female
frog


the
eggs
are
called


tadpoles
have
tails
and
gills


when
they
grow
up
they
lose
their
tails
and
gills
and
grow
four
long
legs


adult
frogs
can
jump
with
their
legs


they
have
long
tongues
that
they
use
to
catch
bugs


they
make
a
sound
called
a
croak


some
species
live
in
trees
and
some
types
of
frog
are
protected
by
being
poisonous


frogs
live
all
over
the
world


if
an
overseas
species
of
frogs
is
introduced
to
another
country
the
ecosystem
might
be
affected


frog
legs
are
occasionally
eaten
as
food
in
france
china
and
the
midwest
of
the
united
states


the
killing
of
frogs
might
have
an
effect
on
the
ecosystem


for
example
frogs
eat
mosquitoes


if
frogs
are
killed
then
there
are
fewer
frogs
to
eat
mosquitoes
so
more
and
more
mosquitoes
are
born


therefore
in
these
areas
there
are
more
diseases
that
mosquitoes
carry
because
there
are
more
mosquitoes


however
for
this
to
apply
frogs
would
have
to
be
a
major
predator
of
mosquitoes


this
would
only
rarely
be
the
case


frogs
are
members
of
the
class
the
only
class

that

if

cold
amphibians
will
not
be

amphibians
can
get
heat
from
the
sun
usually
indirectly
whereas
reptiles
can
bask

the

usually

some
frogs
during

or
during
droughts


they
usually
look

to


these
include
burrowing
in

and

they
survive
by
getting
oxygen
through
their

they

frogs
have

with
no

they
can
take
