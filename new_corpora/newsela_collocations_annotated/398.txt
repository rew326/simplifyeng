can
hold
many
more

than
the

a
<collocation>digital camera</collocation>
can
sometimes
hold
hundreds
of
pictures


different

are
sold
that

there
nemo
meets
a
group
of
aquarium
fish
called

and
ambitious
moorish
idol
named
gill

a

peach
a

gurgle
a

a

the

plans
to
give
nemo
to
his
niece


she
is
infamous
for
killing
a
goldfish
given
to
her
previously
by
constantly
shaking
the
bag


in
order
to
avoid
this
fate
gill
gives
nemo
a
role
in
an
escape
plan
which
involves
jamming
the
tank
filter
and
forcing
the
dentist
to
remove
the
fish
from
the
tank
to
clean
it
manually


the
fish
would
be
placed
in
plastic
bags
at
which
point
they
would
roll
out
the
window
and
into
the
harbor


after
a
friendly
pelican
named
visits
with
news
of
marlin
adventure
nemo
succeeds
in
jamming
the
filter
but
the
plan
backfires
when
the
dentist
installs
a
new
filter


while

east
australian
current
marlin
and
dory
get
lost
in
the
blooms
of
plankton
and
krill
and
are
caught
by
a
blue
whale


inside
the
whale
<collocation>immense mouth</collocation>
marlin
tries
to
escape
while
dory
talks
with
it
in


so
the
whale
carries
them
to
<collocation>sydney harbour</collocation>
and
expels
them
through
his
blowhole


they
are
met
by
who
recognizes
marlin
from
the
stories
he
has
heard
and
rescues
him
and
dory
from
a
flock
of
hungry
seagulls
by
scooping
them
into
his
beak
and
taking
them
to

man
office


by

has
arrived
and
the

is
prepared
to
give

to
her


nemo
tries

play
dead
in
hopes
of
saving
himself
and
at
the
same
time
arrives


marlin
sees
nemo
and
mistakes
this
act
for
the
actual
death
of
his
son


after
a
struggle
gill
helps
nemo
escape
into
a
drain
through
a
sink


sad
marlin
leaves
dory
and
begins
to
swim
back
home


dory
then
loses
her
memory
and
becomes
confused
but
meets
nemo
who
has
reached
the
ocean
through
an
underwater
drainpipe


dory
memory
is
restored
after
she
reads
the
word
sydney
on
a
nearby
drainpipe
and
remembering
her
journey
she
<collocation>guides nemo</collocation>
to
marlin


after
the
two
joyfully
reunite
dory
is
caught
in
a
fishing
net
with
a
school
of
grouper


nemo
bravely
enters
the
net
and
directs
the
group
to
swim
downward
to
break
the
net
reminiscent
of
a
similar
scenario
that
occurred
in
the
fish
tank
earlier


the
fish
including
dory
succeed
in
breaking
the
net
and
escape


after
some
days
nemo
leaves
for
school
once
more
and
marlin
who
is
no
longer
overprotective
or
doubtful
of
his
son
safety
proudly
<collocation>watches nemo</collocation>
swim
away
into
the
distance


back
at
the
dentist
office
the
filter
breaks
down
and
the

gang
escape
into
the
harbor


but
they
realize
that
they

in

roger
gave
the
film
four

it
one
of
those
rare
movies
where

broadway
star
lane
who
was
the
voice
of
timon
the
meerkat
in
the
lion
king
said
finding
nemo
was
his
favorite
animated
film


the
film
use
of
prompted
mass
purchase
of
the
animal
as
pets
in
the
united
states
even
though
the
movie
portrayed
the
use
of
fish
as
pets
negatively
and
suggested
that
saltwater
aquariums
are
notably
tricky
and
expensive
to
maintain


the
demand
for
was
supplied
by
harvesting
of
tropical
fish
in
regions
like


at
the
same
time
the
film
had
a
quote
that
all
drains
lead
back
to
the
ocean
nemo
escapes
from
the
aquarium
by
going
down
a
<collocation>sink drain</collocation>
ending
up
in
the
sea


since
water
typically
undergoes
treatment
before
leading
to
the
ocean
the
environmental
company
quipped
that
a
more
realistic
title
for
the
movie
might
be
grinding
nemo


however
in
sydney
much
of
the
sewer
system
does
pass
directly
to
pipes
deep
offshore
without
a
high
level
of
treatment
although
pumping
and
some
filtering
occur


additionally
according
to
the
there
was
a
cut
sequence
with
nemo
going
through
a
treatment
plant
mechanisms
before
ending
up
in
the
ocean
pipes


however
in
the
final
product
logos
for
sydney
water
treatment
are
featured
prominently
along
the
path
to
the
ocean
implying
that
nemo
did
pass
through
some
water
treatment


the
australian
tourism
commission
launched
several
<collocation>marketing campaigns</collocation>

many
of
them

used
finding
nemo
to
draw
tourists
to
promote
its
state
for
vacationers


on
the
of
<collocation>entertainment weekly</collocation>
wrote
that
its
emotional
power
was
deepened
by
the
dimensionality
of
the
oceanic
deep
where
the
spatial
mysteries
of
watery
currents
and
floating
worlds
are
exactly
where
explorers
were
born
to
boldly
go


the
also
prompted
a
retrospective
on
the
film
then
nine
years
after
its
initial
release


stephen
of
the
newark
described
it
as
a
genuinely
funny
and
touching
film
that
in
less
than
a
decade
has
established
itself
as
a
<collocation>timeless classic</collocation>
with
roger
moore
of
the
news
service
calling
the
movie
the
gold
standard
against
which
all
other
modern
animated
films
are
measured


home
media
finding
nemo
was
released
on
and
on
november


the
film
was
also
released
on
in
a
gold
edition
which
came
with
a
finding
nemo
stuffed
toy
character


the
film
had
a
home
video
release
on
both
and
on
december
with
both
a
and
a
set


production
the
inspiration
for
nemo
was
made
up
of
multiple
experiences


the
idea
goes
back
to
when
director
andrew
was
a
child
when
he
loved
going
to
the
dentist
to
see
the
fish
tank
assuming
that
the
fish
were
from
the
ocean
and
wanted
to
go
home


in
shortly
after
his
son
was
born
he
and
his
family
took
a
trip
to
six
<collocation>flags discovery</collocation>
kingdom
which
was
called
marine
world
at
the
time


there
he
saw
the
shark
tube
and
various
exhibits
he
felt
that
the
underwater
world
could
be
done
beautifully
in
computer
animation


later
in
he
took
his
son
for
a
walk
in
the
park
but
found
that
he
was
over
protecting
him
constantly
and
lost
an
opportunity
to
have
any
experiences
on
that
day


in
an
interview
with
national
geographic
magazine
he
stated
that
the
idea
for
the
characters
of
marlin
and
nemo
came
from
a
photograph
of
two
peeking
out
of
an
anemone
it
was
so
arresting


i
had
no
idea
what
kind
of
fish
they
were
but
i
could
take
my
eyes
off
them


and
as
an
entertainer
the
fact
that
they
were
called
it
was
perfect


there
almost
nothing
more
appealing
than
these
little
fish
that
want
to
<collocation>play peekaboo</collocation>
with
you


also
are
very
colorful
but
do
tend
to
come
out
of
an
anemone
very
often
and
for
a
character
who
has
to
go
on
a
dangerous
journey
felt
a
was
the
perfect
kind
of
fish
for
the
character


of
the
film
took
place
in
early


began
writing
the
screenplay
during
the
of
a
bug
life


as
such
it
began
production
with
a
<collocation>complete screenplay</collocation>
something
that
lee
called
very
unusual
for
an
animated
film


the
artists
took
scuba
<collocation>diving lessons</collocation>
so
they
could
go
and
study
the
coral
reef


the
idea
for
the
initiation
sequence
came
from
a
story
conference
between
andrew
and
bob
while
driving
to
record
the
actors


ellen
was
cast
after
was
watching
ellen
with
his
wife
and
seeing
ellen
change
the
subject
five
times
before
finishing
one
sentence
as
recalled


there
was
a
pelican
character
known
as
gerald
who
in
the
final
film
ends
up
swallowing
and
choking
on
marlin
and
dory
who
was
originally
a
friend
of


they
were
going
to
play
against
each
other
as
being
neat
fastidious
while
gerald
being
scruffy
and
sloppy


however
the
filmmakers
could
not
find
an
<collocation>appropriate scene</collocation>
for
them
that
did
slow
the
pace
of
the
picture
down
so
gerald
character
was
minimized


himself
provided
the
voice
of
crush
the
sea
turtle


originally
did
the
voice
for
the
film
<collocation>story reel</collocation>
and
assumed
they
would
find
an
actor
later


when
performance
was
popular
in
<collocation>test screenings</collocation>
decided
to
keep
his
performance
in
the
film


recorded
all
his
dialogue
while
lying
on
a
sofa
in
lee
office


crush
son
squirt
was
voiced
by
nicholas
bird
the
young
son
of
fellow
director
brad
bird


according
to
the
elder
bird
was
playing
a
tape
recording
of
his
young
son
around
the
studios
one
day


felt
the
voice
was
this
generation
thumper
and
immediately
cast
nicholas


revealed
that
she
was
originally
doing
a
voice
in
the
film


according
to
the
producers
were
dissatisfied
to
learn
that
the
voice
of
her
character
karen
walker
on
the
television
show
will
grace
was
not
her
natural
speaking
voice


the
producers
hired
her
anyway
and
then
strongly
encouraged
her
to
use
her
karen
walker
voice
for
the
role


when
refused
she
was
dismissed


the
film
was
dedicated
to
a
animator
who
died
of
melanoma
in
october


finding
nemo
shares
many
plot
elements
with
pierrot
the
a
children
book
published
in
but
allegedly
conceived
in


the
author
le
sued
disney
for
infringement
of
his
intellectual
rights


the
judge
ruled
against
him
citing
the
color
differences
between
pierrot
and
nemo


to
ensure
that
the
movements
of
the
fish
in
the
film
were
believable
the
animators
essentially
took
a
crash
course
in
fish
biology
and
oceanography


they
visited

went
diving
in
hawaii
and
received
