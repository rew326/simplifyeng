history
the

was
started
in
the
summer
of

thomas
using
source
code
from
spyglass


mosaic
an
early
commercial
web
browser
with
formal
ties
to
the
pioneering
mosaic
browser


in
late
<collocation>licensed spyglass</collocation>
mosaic
for
a
quarterly
fee
plus
a
percentage
of
revenues
for
the
software


although
bearing
a
name
similar
to
mosaic
the
spyglass
mosaic
had
used
the
mosaic
source
code
sparingly


<collocation>internet explorer</collocation>
<collocation>internet explorer</collocation>
made
its
debut
on

it
was
a
reworked
version

several

later

rendering


however
by
including
it
for
free
on
their
os
they
did
not
have
to
<collocation>pay royalties</collocation>
to
spyglass
which
resulted
in
a
lawsuit

a
settlement


<collocation>internet explorer</collocation>
<collocation>internet explorer</collocation>

<collocation>internet explorer</collocation>
has
introduced
an
array
of
<collocation>proprietary extensions</collocation>
to
many
of
the
standards
including
and
the
dom


this
has
resulted
in
a
number
of
web
pages
that
appear
broken
in
web
browsers
and
has
introduced
the

<collocation>internet explorer</collocation>
has
introduced
a
number
of
extensions
to
which
have
been
adopted
by
other
browsers


these
include
the
property
which
returns
the
string
within
an

the
object
which
allows
the
sending
of
request
and
receiving
of

and
the
attribute
of
the
object
which
enables
rich
text
editing
of

some
of
these
were
not
possible
until
the
introduction
of

<collocation>synchronization support</collocation>

the

however
all
were
rejected
at

in
their
original
forms


was
however
subsequently
combined
with
proposed
by
adobe
and
sun
resulting
in
the

currently
one
of
the
few
vector

formats
being
used
on

other
behaviors
include
support
for

different

support

of
image

are
not

support

the
short
for
<collocation>favorites icon</collocation>
introduced
by
<collocation>internet explorer</collocation>
is
now
also
supported
and
extended
in
other
browsers


it
allows
web

architecture
the
architecture
of


previous
versions
had
a
similar
architecture
except
that
both
tabs
and
the
ui
were
within
the
same
process


consequently
each
browser
window
could
have
only
one
<collocation>tab process</collocation>


<collocation>internet explorer</collocation>
uses
a
architecture
built
on
the
component
object
model
com
technology


it
consists
of
several
major
components
each
of
which
is
contained
in
a
separate
library
and
exposes
a
set
of
com
programming
interfaces
hosted
by
the
<collocation>internet explorer</collocation>
main
executable


is
the
protocol
handler
for
and


it
handles
all
network
communication
over
these
protocols


is
responsible
for
mime
type
handling
and
download
of
web
content
and
provides
a
wrapper
around


and
other
protocol


houses
the
trident
rendering
engine
introduced
in
<collocation>internet explorer</collocation>
which
is
responsible
for
displaying
the
pages
and
handling
the
document
object
model
of
the
web
pages


the
file
and
creates
the
<collocation>internal dom</collocation>
tree
representation
of
it


it
also
exposes
a
set
of
for
inspection
and
modification
of
the
dom
tree


the
dom
tree
is
further
processed
by
a
<collocation>layout engine</collocation>
which
then
renders
the
internal
representation
on
screen


contains
the
<collocation>user interface</collocation>
and
window
of
ie
in
<collocation>internet explorer</collocation>
and
above


provides
the
navigation
local
caching
and
history
for
the
browser


is
responsible
for
the
browser
<collocation>user interface</collocation>
including
the
<collocation>browser chrome</collocation>
which
houses
all
the
menus
and


<collocation>internet explorer</collocation>
does
not
include
any
native
scripting
functionality


exposes
an
that
permit
a
programmer
to
develop
a
scripting
environment
to
be
and
to
access
the
dom
tree


<collocation>internet explorer</collocation>
includes
the
bindings
for
the
active
scripting
engine
which
is
a
part
of
windows
and
allows
any
language
implemented
as
an
active
scripting
module
to
be
used
for
scripting


by
default
only
the
and
modules
are
provided
third
party
like
for
support
can
also
be
used


also
makes
available
the
that
allows
<collocation>cli languages</collocation>
including
dlr
based
dynamic
languages
like
and
to
be
used
for
scripting


<collocation>internet explorer</collocation>
introduces
some
major
architectural
changes
called
loosely
coupled
ie


separates
the
main
window
process
frame
process
from
the
processes
hosting
the
different
web
applications
in
different
tabs
<collocation>tab processes</collocation>


a
frame
process
can
create
<collocation>multiple tab</collocation>
processes
each
of
which
can
be
of
a
different
integrity
level
each
<collocation>tab process</collocation>
can
host
multiple
web
sites


the
processes
use
communication
to
synchronize
themselves


generally
there
will
be
a
single
frame
process
for
all
web
sites


in
<collocation>windows vista</collocation>
with
protected
mode
turned
on
however
opening
<collocation>privileged content</collocation>
such
as
local
pages
will
create
a
new
<collocation>tab process</collocation>
as
it
will
not
be
constrained
by
protected
mode


<collocation>internet explorer</collocation>
exposes
a
set
of
component
object
model
com
interfaces
that
allow
other
components
to
extend
the
functionality
of
the
browser


is
divided
into
two
types
browser
and
content


the
browser
interfaces
can
be
used
to
plug
in
components
to
add
<collocation>context menu</collocation>
entries
<collocation>menu items</collocation>
or
browser
helper
objects


are
used
to
extend
the
feature
set
of
the
browser
whereas
the
other
options
are
used
to
expose
the
feature
in
the
ui


content
interfaces
are
used
by
different
handlers
to
add
support
for
<collocation>content formats</collocation>


not
only
have
<collocation>unrestricted access</collocation>
to
the
<collocation>internet explorer</collocation>
dom
and
event
model
they
also
can
access
the
registry
and
other
os
components


content
can
be
either
in
terms
of
active
documents
<collocation>doc objects</collocation>
or
or
controls


controls
are
used
for
<collocation>content handlers</collocation>
that
render
content
embedded
within
an
page
adobe
flash
or


<collocation>doc objects</collocation>
are
used
when
the
content
type
will
not
be
embedded
in
word
or


in
fact
the
trident
rendering
engine
is
itself
exposed
as
a
doc
object
so
in
itself
is
treated
as
an
active
document


<collocation>internet explorer</collocation>
components
run
with
the
same
privileges
as
the
browser
itself
unlike
scripts
that
have
a
very
limited
set
of
privileges


can
be
installed
either
locally
or
directly
by
a
web
site
