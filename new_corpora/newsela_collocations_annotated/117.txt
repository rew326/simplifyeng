in

this

having
suffered

many

this

fallen

with

low
combined
mass
only

not
support
the
hypothesis


also
the
significant
chemical
differences
between
the
asteroids
are
difficult
to
explain
if
they
come
from
the
same
planet


today
most
scientists
accept
that
the
asteroids
never
formed
a
planet
at
all


in
general
the
formation
and
evolution
of
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
happened
when
a
cloud
of
<collocation>interstellar dust</collocation>
and
gas
collapsed
under
the
influence
of
gravity
to
form
the
sun
and
and
eventually
the
planets


this
gravitational
led
to
the
formation
of
the
rocky
planets
and
the
<collocation>gas giants</collocation>


in
the
region
which
would
become
the
<collocation>asteroid belt</collocation>
were
too
strongly
disturbed
by
jupiter
gravity
to
form
a
planet


instead
they
continued
to
orbit
the
sun
as
before
while
occasionally
colliding


in
regions
where
the
velocity
of
the
collisions
was
too
high
the
shattering
of
was
more
common
than
preventing
the
formation
of
bodies

a
democracy
a
word
from
the
greek
language
meaning
rule
by
the
people
is
a
kind
of
government


a
democracy
is
a
system
where
people
are
able
to
decide
how
their
country
or
community
should
be
run


the
most
common
type
of
democracy
is
<collocation>representative democracy</collocation>
where
people
elect
their
leaders
normally
by
holding
an
election
who
decide
the
laws


elections
are
usually
held
every
few
years


when
they
happen
whoever
gets
the
most
votes
will
end
up
with
the
most
power
until
the
next
election


an
important
part
of
<collocation>representative democracy</collocation>
is
political
parties


politicians
belong
to
a
political
party
an
organization
of
politicians
with
similar
ideas
on
what
to
do


therefore
in
elections
people
do
not
just
vote
for
a
single
person
but
for
political
parties


to
become
a
stable
democracy
a
state
usually
undergoes
a
process

<collocation>democratic consolidation</collocation>

in
<collocation>direct democracies</collocation>
everyone
has
the
right
to

together


one
modern
example
of
direct

is
a

which

for
the
kind

way
to
pass
a
law
where
everyone

votes
on
it


<collocation>direct democracies</collocation>
are
not

used

countries
because
it
is
hard
to
get
millions

people
to

all

there

time


in

indirect

<collocation>representative democracy</collocation>
people
choose
representatives

these

the

in

in

they

the
participants

would
change
every

and
the
amount

in

the

the

play
rules
and
competition
all
fail
to
correctly
define
what
games
are


he
concluded
that
people
apply
the
term
game
to
a
range
of
different
human
activities
that
are
only
related
a
<collocation>little bit</collocation>


roger
french
sociologist
roger
in
his
book
les
jeux
et
les
games
and
men
said
that
a
game
is
an
activity
that
must
have
the
following
traits
fun
the
activity
is
chosen
because
it
is
fun
separate
it
is
circumscribed
in
time
and
place
uncertain
the
outcome
of
the
activity
is
not
known
at
the
beginning
participation
does
not
accomplish
anything
useful
governed
by
rules
the
activity
has
rules
that
are
different
from
everyday
life
fictitious
it
is
accompanied
by
the
awareness
of
a
different
reality
computer
game
designer
attempted
to
define
the
term
game
using
a
series
of
creative
expression
is
art
if
made
for
its
own
beauty
and
entertainment
if
made
for
money


this
is
the
least
rigid
of
his
definitions


acknowledges
that
he
often
chooses
a
creative
path
over
conventional
business
wisdom
which
is
why
only
one
of
his
games
is
a
sequel


a
piece
of
entertainment
is
a
plaything
if
it
is
interactive


movies
and
books
are
cited
as
examples
of
entertainment


if
no
goals
are
associated
with
a
plaything
it
is
a
toy


notes
that
by
his
definition
a
a
toy
can
become
a
game
element
if
the
player
makes
up
rules
and
b
the
sims
and
are
toys
not
games


if
it
has
goals
a
plaything
is
a
challenge


if
a
challenge
has
no
active
agent
against
whom
you
compete
it
is
a
puzzle
if
there
is
one
it
is
a
conflict


admits
that
this
is
a
subjective
test


video
games
with
noticeably
algorithmic
<collocation>artificial intelligence</collocation>
can
be
played
as
puzzles
these
include
the
patterns
used
to
evade
ghosts
in


finally
if
the
player
can
only
outperform
the
opponent
but
not
attack
them
to
interfere
with
their
performance
the
conflict
is
a
competition


competitions
include
racing
and
figure
skating


however
if
attacks
are
allowed
then
the
conflict
qualifies
as
a
game


definition
may
thus
be
rendered
as
an
interactive
activity
active
agents
to
play
against
in
which
players
including
active
agents
can
interfere
with
each
other


other
definitions
a
game
is
a
system
in
which
players
engage
in
an
artificial
conflict
defined
by
rules
that
results
in
a
quantifiable
outcome
