anymore


this

from
enemy
attacks


a
few
still

battle
cruisers
have

frigates
are
often
now
the
same
size


they
are
mainly
used
to
launch
guided
missiles
or
to
shoot
down
enemy

cruisers
are
usually

and
larger
and
have

most
cruisers
and

are
large
enough
to
hold
helicopters
on
the

ship


this

is
called

cruisers
can
usually
hold
one

although
they

some
frigates
are
designed
to
hold
two
or
three


destroyers
are
smaller
and
faster
than
cruisers
and
frigates


they
are
usually
used
to
hunt
down
enemy
submarines


sometimes
they
will
also
attack
enemy
airplanes


they
can
also
go
closer
to
shore
than
larger
ships


this
allows
them
to
attack
things
on

the

samba
is
a
lively
rhythmical
dance
of
brazilian
origin
in
time


in
<collocation>ballroom dance</collocation>
there
are
three
steps
to
every
bar
making
the
samba
feel
something
like
a
timed
dance


the
timing
is
one
with
the
values
about

there
are
two
main
types
of
samba
that
differ
from

other
the
modern

and
the
traditional

of
brazil


traditional
brazilian
samba
includes
the
samba
which
is
danced
solo
at
carnival


in
that
case
the
dancers
take
just
one
step
on
each
beat


origins
the
ballroom
samba
has
its
origins
in
brazil
at
the
beginning
of
the
century


many
steps
can
be
traced
back
to
the
danced
in


a
book
published
in
france
in
already
described
how
to
perform
the
samba


the
modern
<collocation>ballroom dance</collocation>
was
created
in
england
mostly
with
steps
adapted
from
those
seen
in
brazil


this
version
is
now
danced
all
over
the

the

movements
which
do

borrows
some
movements
from
traditional
dances
such
those
used
in
rituals


the
ballroom
samba
is
danced
to
music
in
time


the
basic
movements
are
counted
either
or
and
are
danced
with
a
slight
bouncing
action


this
action
is
created
through
the
bending
and
straightening
of
the
knees
with
bending
occurring
on
the
beats

the

where
the
musicians
will
move
along
with

sometimes

sometimes

a
nuclear
weapon
is
a
weapon
that
suddenly
releases
the
energy
in
the
nucleus
of
certain
types
of
atoms


when
triggered
these
devices
release
a
huge
amount
of
energy
in
the
form
of
an
explosion


nuclear
weapons
are
also
known
as
atomic
bombs
atom
bombs
or


nuclear
weapons
are
very
powerful
and
one
nuclear
weapon
can
destroy
a
city


they
get
their
energy
by
changing
some
of
their
matter
into
energy


this
is
called
a
nuclear
explosion


nuclear
explosions
are
difficult
to
ignite
and
control
and
require
uranium
or
plutonium
that
has
been
enriched
for
reactive
isotopes


these
isotopes
are
not
concentrated
enough
in
natural
uranium
to
cause
explosions


nuclear
explosion

nevada
in


the
first
nuclear
weapons
were
created
by
the
united
states
during
<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii
and
used
against
the
cities
of
hiroshima
and
nagasaki
in
japan


this
is
the
only
time
in
history
when
nuclear
weapons
have
been
used
in
combat


this
development
was
called
the
manhattan
project


the
manhattan
project
took
place
in
alamos
new
mexico


the
first
atomic
bomb
was
tested
at
the
trinity
site
at
white
sands
in
southern
new
mexico


nuclear
weapons
are
made
from
the
elements
uranium
or
plutonium


certain
forms
of
these
elements
can
be
made
to
undergo
<collocation>nuclear fission</collocation>
and
have
a
nuclear
chain
reaction


this
produces
a
very
large
amount
of
energy
and
radiation
and
will
kill
any
people
or
animals
within
several
kilometers


much
of
the
radiation
is
which
heats
air
to
produce
a
huge
nuclear
fireball


the
rapid
expansion
of
the
fireball
produces
a
dangerous
shock
wave
that
destroys
houses
or
buildings
even
several
kilometers
away


it
will
eventually
kill
people
farther
away
than
several
kilometers
depending
on
how
much
radiation
the
person
received


the
mutations
in
the
cause
cancer
and
radiation
poisoning


nuclear
bombs
release
fallout
which
is
nuclear
material
and
dust
that
has
been
irradiated
and
became
radioactive


this
poisonous
dust
is
blown
by
the
winds
for
tens
or
hundreds
of
kilometers
and
can
remain
dangerous
for
several
years


a
hydrogen
bomb
or
fusion
bomb
is
a
nuclear
weapon
which
utilizes
hydrogen
isotopes
deuterium
and
tritium
as
another
type
of
fuel


hydrogen
bombs
can
be
many
hundreds
of
times
more
powerful
than
fission
bombs


despite
the
name
in
hydrogen
bombs
in
use
the
hydrogen
is
only
there
to
produce
enough
neutrons
to
also
detonate
a
casing
made
of
natural
uranium


the
fuel
in
hydrogen
bombs
is
thus
mostly
unrefined
uranium

the
delivery
of
the
nuclear

to
its
target
is
as
complex
as
making
one


a
nuclear
<collocation>explosive device</collocation>
can
be
placed
in
a
bomb
or
artillery
shell
or
into
a
missile
which
is
called
a
nuclear

nuclear
missiles
can
be
carried
by
aircraft
submarines
or
trucks
or
they
can
be
placed
into
underground
missile
silos


<collocation>strategic bomber</collocation>
aircraft
like
the

and
spirit
are
used
to
carry
nuclear
weapons


they
are
also
carried
by
missiles
such
as
intercontinental
ballistic
missiles
or
ballistic
missiles


some
missiles
travel
to
the
border
of
space
and
then
launch
a
number
of
separate
nuclear
weapons
back
toward
the
ground
and
each
one
can
travel
to
a
different
target


this
is
called

very
large
nuclear
bombs
have
been
produced
by
in
practice
a
can
produce
as
much
damage
from
several
smaller
explosions


nuclear
weapons
cost
a
lot
of
money
to
make
because
the
materials
they
are
made
of
are
very
rare
and
it
takes
many
scientists
to
make
them


but
many
countries
have
managed
to
create
nuclear
weapons


many
countries
in
the
world
possess
nuclear
weapons
today

are

israel
is
thought
to
also
have
nuclear
weapons
but
the
israeli
government
does
deny
or
confirm
this


many
people
said
that
north
korea
had
nuclear
weapons
and
they
have
said
that
they
do
but
now
they
say
that
they
will
not
make
any
more

iran
is

to

diamond
from
the
ancient
greek
unbreakable
is
a
of
carbon
atoms
those
are
also
called


diamonds
have
the
highest
hardness
of
any
bulk
all
one
type
material


because
of
this
many
important
industries
use
diamonds
as
tools
for
cutting
and
polishing
things


many
of
them
are
clear
but
some
of
them
have
colors
like
yellow
red
blue
green
and
pink


diamonds
of
a
different
color
are
called
fancies


big
diamonds
are
very
rare
and
are
worth
a
lot
of
money


this
is
because
a
diamond
is
very
useful
it
is
very
hard
and
it
spreads
light
very
well


there
are
natural
and
<collocation>synthetic diamonds</collocation>


the
earth
makes
natural
diamonds


people
make
<collocation>synthetic diamonds</collocation>


diamonds
are
the
hardest
natural
substance
known
to
man


diamonds
are
actually
made
of
pure
carbon
the
same
<collocation>chemical element</collocation>
as
graphite
and
coal


but
diamonds
are
very
hard
and
in
crystalline
form


because
many
diamonds
are
beautiful
people
make
jewellery
using
them


diamonds
are
very
effective
electrical
but
also
very
good
conductors
of
heat


on
scale
of
mineral
hardness
diamonds
are
scored
as
the
highest
score
possible


diamonds
are
made
deep
in
the
earth
where
there
is
an
intense
amount
of
pressure
and
heat
that
makes
the
diamond
form


the
intense
heat
and
pressure
is
forming
the
liquid
ore
to
make
<collocation>volcanic eruptions</collocation>
which
surfaces
and
becomes
diamond
crystals


this
makes
the
diamond
a
<collocation>metamorphic rock</collocation>


sometimes
magma
very
hot
liquid
rock
deep
in
the
earth
having
diamonds
will
come
near
the
top
of
a
volcano


people
find
diamonds
where
volcanoes
were
a
long
time
ago


sometimes
people
find
diamonds
on
the
top
of
the
ground


but
in
places
like
south
africa
they
must
dig
deep
down
into
a
diamond
mine
to
get
diamonds


diamonds
were
first
found
in
india
