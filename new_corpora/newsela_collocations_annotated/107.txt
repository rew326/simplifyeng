interesting
and
unusual
geographic
features
have
developed
which
make
it
different
from
any

so

numerous
mountains

the

of
a
particularly
famous
geyser
on

iceland
though
considered
to
be
a
european
country
sits
partly
in
north
america
since
it
straddles
the
ridge
which
marks
the
boundary
between
the
eurasian
and
north
american
<collocation>tectonic plates</collocation>


the
ridge
runs
directly
through
the
<collocation>populated reykjavik</collocation>
and
historic
areas
and
the
tectonic
activity
of
these
plates
separating

people
the
people
in
iceland
are
mostly
of
scandinavian
origin


the
language
they
speak
is
icelandic


the
language
has
not
changed
much
in
years
so
icelanders
are
still
able
to
read
the
sagas
about
the
vikings
without
many
problems


most
people
in
iceland
are
christian


most
of
them
are
lutheran


icelandic
people
are
considered
to
be
the
most
happiest
people
on
earth


iceland
has
the
highest
birth
rate
in
europe
highest
divorce
rate
and
the
highest
percentage
of
women
working
outside
their
home


names
there
are
no
real
surnames
on
iceland


children
get
the
first
name
of
their
father
sometimes
mother
with
son
if
it
a
boy
and
if
it
a
girl


for
example
a
man
named
has
a
son
named


last
name
will
not
be
like
his
father
it
will
become


the
same
goes
for
women


daughter
would
not
have
the
last
name
she
would
have
the
name


in
most
countries
people
use
to
call
other
people
by
their
surname
but
in
iceland
people
call
other
people
by
their
first
name


so
when
people
talk
about
they
do
not
call
him
but
