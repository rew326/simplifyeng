the
whaling
industry
around

has
depleted
the
whale
population
by
massive
commercial
hunting
and
now
traditional
whale
hunting
for
<collocation>subsistence purposes</collocation>
is
rare
around
the
world


industrialization
of
the
world
has
also
contributed
to
pollution
causing
high
mercury
levels
in
much
sea
life
including
whales


this
has
made
it
necessary
to
add
to
the
modern
northern
diet
with
<collocation>grocery foods</collocation>
which
are
normally
very
expensive
in
the
north


during
the
summer
months
the
were
able
to
gather
berries
and
roots
to
eat


they
also
collected
grass
to
line
their
boots
or
make
baskets


often
the
food
they
found
or
killed
during
the
summer
was
put
into
a
cache
for
use
during
the
long
winter


a
cache
was
created
by
digging
down
to
the
permafrost
and
building
a
rock
lined
pit
there


the
top
would
be
covered
with
a
pile
of
rocks
to
keep
out
the
animals


it
was
as
good
as
a
freezer
because
the
food
would
stay
frozen
there
until
the
family
needed
it


cultural
traditions
and
traditional
stories
provided
each
new
generation
with
the
and
knowledge
to
survive
their
environment
and
work
together


they
usually
moved
around
in
small
groups
looking
for
food
and
sometimes
they
would
get
together
with
other
groups
to
hunt
for
larger
animals
such
as
whales


the
men
did
the
hunting
and
home
building
and
also
made
weapons
sleds
and
boats


the
women
cooked
made
the
clothes
and
took
care
of
the
children


north
american
arctic
peoples
today
today
most
live
in
modern
houses


many
still
hunt
or
fish
for
a
major
part
of
their
food
supply
and
sometimes
some
income


seal
pelts
are
used
to
protect
from
the
extreme
cold
in
the
arctic
and
are
far
more
effective
than
man
made
fabrics


the
technology
behind
it
has
been
clearly
proven
throughout
the
history
of
people


besides
the
affordability
of
commercial
is
an
expensive
barrier


they
use
rifles
and
broken
link
snowmobile
snowmobiles
when
hunting
now
however
traditional
values
respecting
the
animals
hunted
still
very
much
applies


in
alaska
many
of
the
people
have
received
money
from
the
oil
discovered
in
that
state
on
their
traditional
lands


the
arctic
is
very
different
from
the
rest
of
the
world
that
the
way
of
life
in
the
south
does
not
work
well
in
the
north


canada
values

irrefutable
proof

over
the
canadian
portion

four
kinds
of
baskets


a
basket
is

a
coiled
basket
is
made
by
sewing
rings
of
a
fibrous
material
to
the
previous
ring


twined
baskets
have
flexible
weavers
that
are
twined
around
the
spokes
in
a

coffin
to

the
