electromagnetism
electric
charge
is
a
basic
property
of
electrons
protons
and
other
<collocation>subatomic particles</collocation>


electrons
are
negatively
charged
while
protons
are
positively
charged


things
that
are
negatively
charged
and
things
that
are
positively
charged
pull
on
attract
each
other


this
makes
electrons
and
protons
stick
together
to
form
atoms


things
that
have
the
same
charge
push
each
other
away
they
repel
each
other


this
is
called
the
law
of
charges


it
was
discovered
by
charles
augustin
de
coulomb


the
law
that
describes
how
strongly
charges
pull
and
push
on
each
other
is
called
coulomb
law


things
that
have
equal
numbers
of
electrons
and
protons
are
neutral


things
that
have
more
electrons
than
protons
are
negatively
charged
while
things
with
fewer
electrons
than
protons
are
positively
charged


things
with
the
same
charge
repel
each
other


things
that
have
different
charges
attract
each
other


if
possible
the
one
with
too
many
electrons
will
give
enough
electrons
to
match
the
number
of
protons
in
the
one
that
has
too
many
protons
for
its
load
of
electrons


if
there
are
just
enough
electrons
to
match
the
extra
protons
then
the
two
things
will
not
attract
each
other
anymore


when
electrons
move
from
a
place
where
there
are
too
many
to
a
place
where
there
are
too
few
that
transfer
makes
an
electrical
current


when
a
person
shuffles
his
feet
on
a
carpet
and
then
touches
a
brass
doorknob
he
or
she
may
get
an
electrical
shock


if
there
are
enough
extra
electrons
then
the
force
with
which
those
electrons
push
each
other
away
may
be
enough
to
make
some
of
the
electrons
jump
across
a
gap
between
the
person
and
the
doorknob


the
length
of
the
spark
is
a
measure
of
voltage
or
electrical
pressure


the
number
of
electrons
that
move
from
one
place
to
another
per
unit
of
time
measured
as
amperage
or
rate
of
electron
flow


if
a
person
gets
a
positive
or
negative
charge
it
may
make
the
person
hairs
stand
up
because
the
charges
in
each
hair
push
it
away
from
the
others


electric
charge
felt
when
one
gets
a
shock
from
a
doorknob
or
other
object
usually
is
between
thousand
and
thousand
volts


however
the
amperage
involved
is
incredibly
low
so
the
flow
of
electrons
through
the
person
body
can
not
cause
physical
harm


on
the
other
hand
when
clouds
gain
electrical
charges
they
have
even
<collocation>higher voltages</collocation>
and
the
amperage
the
number
of
electrons
that
will
flow
in
the
lightning
strike
can
be
very
high


that
means
that
electrons
can
jump
from
a
cloud
to
the
earth
or
from
the
earth
to
a
cloud
and
if
those
electrons
go
through
a
person
then
that
person
will
be
burned
and
may
die


historical
experiment
complex
section
date
february
electric
charge
is
the
fundamental
properties
of
sub
atomic
particles
that
provides
an
electric
field
between
them


let
a
piece
of
glass
and
a
piece
of
resin
neither
of
which
exhibits
any
electrical
properties
be
rubbed
together
and
left
with
the
rubbed
surfaces
in
contact


they
will
still
exhibit
no
electrical
properties


let
them
be
separated


they
will
now
attract
each
other


if
a
second
piece
of
glass
is
rubbed
with
a
second
piece
of
resin
and
if
the
pieces
be
then
separated
and
suspended
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
former
pieces
of
glass
and
resin
it
may
be
observed
that
the
two
pieces
of
glass
repel
each
other


that
each
piece
of
glass
attracts
each
piece
of
resin


that
the
two
pieces
of
resin
repel
each
other


these
phenomena
of
attraction
and
repulsion
are
called
<collocation>electrical phenomena</collocation>
and
the
bodies
which
exhibit
them
are
said
to
be
electrified
or
to
be
charged
with
electricity


besides
being
electrified
by
friction
bodies
may
be
electrified
in
many
other
ways


when
two
substances
are
rubbed
together
and
an
electrical
charge
is
produced
one
of
them
will
give
electrons
to
the
other


the
reason
is
that
the
atoms
in
the
two
substances
have
unequal
power
to
attract
electrons


so
the
one
that
is
more
able
to
attract
electrons
will
rob
electrons
from
the
one
that
has
a
lower
attractive
force


in
one
pair
of
substances
rubbed
together
the
one
made
of
glass
may
either
give
or
take
electrons


what
happens
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
other
member
of
that
pair


if
a
body
electrified
in
any
manner
whatever
behaves
as
the
glass
does
when
rubbed
with
resin
that
is
if
it
repels
the
glass
and
attract
the
resin
the
body
is
said
to
be
electrified
and
if
it
attracts
the
glass
and
repels
the
resin
it
is
said
to
be
electrified


all
electrified
bodies
are
found
to
be
either
or
electrified


proof
date
february
it
is
the
established
practice
of
men
of
science
to
call
the
vitreous
<collocation>electrification positive</collocation>
and
the
<collocation>electrification negative</collocation>


the
exactly
opposite
properties
of
the
two
kinds
of
electrification
justify
us
in
indicating
them
by
opposite
signs
but
the
application
of
the
positive
sign
to
one
rather
than
to
the
other
kind
must
considered
as
a
matter
of
arbitrary
random
choice
convention
agreement
just
as
it
is
a
matter
of
convention
in
mathematical
diagrams
to
reckon
positive
distance
towards
the
right
hand


no
force
either
of
attraction
or
of
repulsion
the
opposite
of
attraction
can
be
observed
between
an
electrified
body
and
a
body
not
electrified

history
in
english
chemist
john
dalton
published
the
first
scientific
article
about
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>


that
was
after
he
found
out
that
he
was
color
blind


the
article
was
called
extraordinary
facts
relating
to
the
vision
of
colors


because
of
this
the
condition
is
sometimes
called


as
of
the
word
is
used
only
for
the
type
of
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
called


seeing
color
there
are
three
steps
in
the
process
of
telling
the
difference
between
colors
light
hits
specialized
nerve
cells
in
the
eye


those
cells
are
called
receptors


some
of
them
are
stimulated
and
create
an
electrical
signal


the
signals
move
along
nerves
to
special
parts
of
the
brain


those
parts
of
the
brain
interpret
the
signals


the
signals
are
changed
into
an
image


this
image
is
then
carefully
looked
at
to
separate
different
objects
to
see
shapes
and
sometimes
colors
and
to
link
these
to
other
kinds
of
information


how
the
human
eye
sees
colors
inside
the
human
eye
is
a
part
called
the
retina


the
retina
receives
the
images
that
the
eye
sees


it
sends
the
images
to
the
brain


the
retina
has
two
types
of
cells
rod
cells
and
cone
cells


they
work
in
different
types
of
light


rod
cells
receive
the
images
that
the
eye
sees
when
the
light
is
dim
at
night
or
in
a
dark
room


cone
cells
receive
the
images
that
the
eye
sees
in
normal
daylight
or
in
bright
light


there
are
three
different
types
of
cone
cells


each
type
has
a
different
pigment
and
reacts
to
a
different
spectrum
of
light


one
is
specially
sensitive
to
short
wavelengths


another
is
sensitive
to
medium
wavelengths


the
third
is
sensitive
to
long
wavelengths


these
wavelengths
cover
much
of
the
visible
light


each
color
is
seen
as
a
result
of
how
much
each
of
the
receptors
is
stimulated


how
the
brain
works
out
the
colors
parts
of
the
thalamus
and
the
<collocation>visual cortex</collocation>
in
the
brain
are
involved
in
seeing
also
seeing
colors


<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
can
therefore
also
result
if
these
areas
of
the
brain
the
optic
nerve
or
the
retina
have
been
damaged


these
types
of
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
usually
happen
because
of
an
accident


they
are
not
inherited


inherited
forms
of
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
affect
the
retina
only


that
way
it
is
possible
that
only
a
part
of
the
visual
field
is
affected
by
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
but
in
the
rest
there
is
no
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>


some
types
of
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
but
not
inherited
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
can
be
cured


causes
of
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
there
are
several
different
problems
that
can
cause
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>


if
a
person
eye
has
no
cone
cells
then
they
can
not
see
any
color
at
all


they
can
only
see
shades
of
dark
and
light


there
are
three
types
of
cone
cells
in
the
human
eye


if
there
are
two
types
a
person
will
have
a
hard
time
to
tell
certain
colors
apart


if
there
is
only
one
type
a
person
will
not
see
color
at
all


sometimes
cone
cells
change


this
means
that
they
no
longer
react
to
those
wavelengths
they
should


a
person
will
need
more
of
a
certain
color
to
see
this
color


they
see
colors
differently
and
may
not
be
able
to
tell
certain
colors
apart


most
of
these
people
do
not
know
they
are
color
blind
as
they
have
little
difficulty
telling
colors
apart
in
most
cases


there
may
be
nothing
wrong
with
the
eye
but
the
nerves
that
transport
the
information
or
the
area
in
the
brain
that
interprets
it
may
be
damaged


this
means
that
the
signal
is
interpreted
the
wrong
way


the
damage
may
be
permanent
or
it
may
be
temporary


certain
conditions
of
the
brain
like
migraine
can
change
the
way
people
see
colors


different
types
of
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
total
<collocation>color blindness</collocation>
this
condition
is
very
rare


people
who
suffer
from
it
can
only
see
in
black
gray
and
white
they
can
perceive
only
differences
in
brightness
and
do
not
see
color


this
is
