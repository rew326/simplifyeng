the
word
cattle
is
used
for
some
wild
animals
as
well
as
for
domesticated
cattle


wild
cattle
include
the
water
buffalo
from
south
east
asia
the
musk
ox
and
yak
from
central
asia
the
bison
of
north
america
and
europe
and
the

this

uses
the
word
cattle
in
the
modern
way


this
article
is
about
the
domestic
farm
animal
and
not
the
wild
cattle
which
still
live
in
some
parts
of
the
world


the
word
head
is
used
by
farmers
when
they
count
the
number
of
cattle
that
they
own


a
farmer
might
say
my
land
runs
head
of
cattle


a
head
means
one
but
the
term
one
head
of
cattle
is
not
usually
used


it
is
easier
to
say
one
cow

<collocation>cattle vocabulary</collocation>
an
intact
<collocation>male bovine</collocation>
is
called
a
bull


a
young
<collocation>male bovine</collocation>
is
called
a
bullock


a
mature
female
that
has
given
birth
to
at
least
one
or
two
calves
is
called
a
cow


a
young
bovine
between
birth
and
weaning
is
called
a
calf


two
or
more
of
these
<collocation>young bovines</collocation>
are
calves


a
female
that
has
never
had
a
calf
is
called
a
heifer
pronounced


calving
is
the
act
of
a
cow
or
heifer
giving
birth
to
a
calf


because
very
few
bulls
are
needed
to
breed
with
many
cows
and
heifers
and
to
form
a
complete
breeding
herd
most
male
cattle
are
used
for
meat


they
are
castrated
by
removing
the
testicles
to
prevent
them
from
being
able
to
breed
other
cows
and
heifers
and
to
take
away
the
male
characteristics
that
are
common
with
bulls


a
male
that
has
been
castrated
before
reaching
puberty
is
called
a
steer


an
ox
is
a
<collocation>male bovine</collocation>
that
has
been
castrated
after
puberty
and
is
trained
and
used
for
draft
purposes
such
as
pulling
a
plow
or
a
wagon


cattle
can
either
be
horned
which
are
two
bony
points
coming
out
on
either
side
of
a
beast
head
one
on
each
side
or
polled
where
no
horns
are
grown
but
a
somewhat
pointy
poll
is
found
at
the
top
of
a
cow
head


the
adjective
that
is
used
to
describe
something
that
is
like
a
cow
or
an
ox
is
bovine


the
words
cow
bull
and
calf
are
also
used
to
describe
some
other
large
animals
that
are
not
related
to
cattle
such
as
elephants
moose
and
whales


biology
highland
cattle
are
adapted
to
cold
weather


cattle
are
found
all
over
the
world
from
as
far
north
as
canada
and
russia
to
the
dry
inland
of
australia


the
only
continent
they
are
not
found
on
is
antarctica


different
types
and
breeds
of
cattle
are
suited
to
different
environments


bos
cattle
such
as
the
brahman
breed
are
suited
to
and
tropical
areas
whereas
bos
taurus
cattle
such
as
angus
cattle
are
more
suited
to
temperate
or
<collocation>colder climates</collocation>


their
large
<collocation>wide hooves</collocation>
are
good
in
both
wet
areas
and
dry
grassland


their
hairy
coat
grows
much
longer
in
the
winter
and
has
an
<collocation>extra fluffy</collocation>
layer
to
hold
in
warmth


they
shed
this
extra
layer
in
spring
in
preparation
for
the
hot
summer
ahead


most
cattle
except
those
of
the
bos
subspecies
do
not
have
<collocation>sweat glands</collocation>
in
their
skin
but
their
wet
nose
is
a
useful
cooling
system


they
can
also
pant
like
a
dog
as
well


cattle
can
make
a
range
of
noises
from
a
gentle
moo
to
a
<collocation>low growl</collocation>
in
warning
or
to
attract
females
especially
among
bulls


when
they
are
angry
or
upset
they
can
bellow
or
bawl
quite
loudly


common
knowledge
is
that
calves
bawl
<collocation>cows moo</collocation>
and
bulls
bellow


cattle
are
herbivorous
meaning
that
they
are
primarily
grass
animals


eating
grass
is
called
grazing


they
have
very
strong
tongues
and
strong
lower
front
teeth
that
help
them
to
graze


unlike
a
horse
cattle
do
not
have
any
upper
front
teeth


a
cow
often
<collocation>swallows grass</collocation>
whole


after
a
cow
has
eaten
its
fill
and
is
resting
they
return
or
regurgitate
the
grass
from
their
stomach
to
their
mouth
and
it
with
their
very
large
back
teeth
to
break
it
down
further


this
is
called
chewing
the
cud


other
like
deer
sheep
and
goats
also
do
this


horses
do
not


this
means
that
cattle
do
not
need
as
much
food
as
horses
even
though
they
are
about
the
same
size


cattle
are
which
mean
they
have
a
stomach
with
several
chambers
which
helps
digest
their
food
more
efficiently


a
cow
stomach
has
four
chambers
called
the
reticulum
rumen
omasum
and
abomasum


the
reticulum
is
known
as
the
hardware
stomach
because
it
is
mainly
used
as
a
storage
area
for
hard
things
that
the
cow
might
accidentally
swallow
like
nails
rocks
and
other
objects


the
rumen
is
the
largest
chamber
in
a
ruminant
stomach
and
in
cattle
it
can
hold
up
to
gallons
feed


it
is
the
chamber
were
fermentation
takes
place
to
help
break
down
the
grass
that
the
cow
has
eaten


the
omasum
also
known
as
many
piles
is
a
compartment
that
squeezes
or
absorbs
all
the
water
that
has
accumulated
from
the
digestion
that
has
gone
on
in
the
rumen


the
fourth
chamber
is
the
abomasum
which
similar
in
function
to
a
human
stomach
and
so
is
called
the
true
stomach


cows
have
breasts
called
udders
which
are
joined
together
in
a
large
sac
often
pink
in
color
found
hanging
between
the
back
legs


the
udder
is
divided
into
four
parts
or
quarters
each
with
a
large
teat
that
the
calf
is
able
to
grasp
with
its
mouth
to
suckle
from


cows
begin
milk
production
a
few
days
before
a
calf
is
born
and
can
continue
to
produce
milk
when
bred
again
and
when
pregnant
with
their
next
calf


heifers
unless
they
have
given
birth
to
their
first
calf
do
not
produce
milk


<collocation>dairy cows</collocation>
tend
to
have
much
<collocation>larger udders</collocation>
than
beef
cows
and
as
such
these
type
of
cows
will
usually
produce
more
milk
than
what
is
needed
to
feed
one
calf


<collocation>dairy cows</collocation>
are
female
cattle
that
are
raised
to
produce
lots
of
milk
for
human
consumption


beef
cows
on
the
other
hand
are
female
cattle
that
are
used
to
raise
a
calf
from
birth
that
is
used
for
beef
later
in
its
life


both
types
of
cows
will
keep
producing
milk
as
long
as
it
is
demanded
either
by
the
calf
by
the
milking
machine
or
by
the
human
that
is
them


when
milk
from
them
is
no
longer
needed
they
will
not
explode
they
simply
dry
up
where
the
milk
they
produce
is
absorbed
or
taken
back
in
by
their
bodies


cows
are
pregnant
for
around
months
or
an
average
of
days


young
cattle
sometimes
fight
to
sort
out
the
order
in
their
herd


bulls
can
often
be
fierce
and
dangerous
especially
in
the
presence
of
their
herd
of
cows
and
heifers


in
the
wild
they
will
often
fight
each
other
over
mating
rights
and
their
herds
of
cows
and
will
use
their
horns
to
gore
each
other


some
bulls
will
fight
to
the
death
others
will
fight
until
either
one
of
the
bulls
decides
to
run
off


they
also
protect
the
herds
from
other
animals
such
as
wolves
jackals
bears
tigers
and
lions


on
farms
bulls
are
usually
quieter
and
more
docile
and
can
be
led
by
a
by
their
owners
but
they
can
be
aggressive
with
other
bulls
and
with
strange
people
or
animals
who
might
get
too
near
his
herd


dairy
bulls
like
jerseys
and
holsteins
tend
to
be
more
aggressive
than
bulls
of
beef
breeds
like
hereford
and
angus


not
all
cattle
have
horns


bulls
with
no
horns
fight
by
the
other
head
neck
side
or
belly
and
will
use
their
heads
to
push
each
other
around


for
the
reasons
above
most
male
cattle
are
either
sent
to
slaughter
while
they
are
still
calves
or
are
castrated
so
that
they
are
much
less
likely
to
fight
each
other
or
be
aggressive
towards
the
farmer
that
is
raising
them
making
them
safer
to
handle
and
keep
until
it
is
time
to
send
them
to
market


steers
have
no
other
purpose
except
to
be
raised
sold
and
slaughtered
for
beef

ever
since
people
started
using
cattle
in
prehistoric
times
cattle
have
been
seen
as
a
sign
of
wealth


in
many
countries
today
particularly
in
africa
and
asia
a
person
wealth
is
judged
by
the
number
of
cattle
they
own


cattle
are
very
useful
animals


their
flesh
can
be
eaten
as
meat


their
milk
can
be
drank
and
turned
into
cheese
and
yogurt


their
skin
can
be
used
as
leather


they
can
pull
carts
and
plows


they
can
make
the
power
to
turn
<collocation>flour mills</collocation>
or
pump
water


the
food
that
they
eat
is
not
expensive
and
often
not
in
competition
with
what
people
eat

cow

a
show
in
england


<collocation>dairy cattle</collocation>
<collocation>dairy cattle</collocation>
are
kept
and
raised
specially
for
milking


herds
of
cows
are
kept
and
are
regularly
mated
with
a
bull
so
that
they
produce
calves


this
keeps
the
milk
supply
going


however
most
commercial
dairy
farms
do
not
keep
bulls
because
of
the
concern
that
such
bulls
are
very
dangerous
when
being
handled


instead
cows
are
artificially
inseminated
with
<collocation>bull semen</collocation>
that
is
stored
kept
frozen
in
<collocation>liquid nitrogen</collocation>
and
is
bred
by
a
person
who
artificially
cows
for
a
living


some
large
dairy
herds
especially
those
used
to
produce
organic
or
milk
are
kept
on
pasture
where
there
is
a
good
supply
of
grass
and
the
fields
are
relatively
small
but
not
so
small
that
they
are
not
able
to
graze
regularly
during
the
season
when
grass
is
growing


this
is
because
the
cows
need
to
be
brought
in
for
milking
every
day
twice
a
day
and
should
not
have
far
to
travel


a
number
of
dairy
herds
are
kept
in
barns
or
sheds
for
most
of
their
lives
and
are
given
feed
that
has
been
especially
made
for
them


this
feed
contains
grain
like
corn
hay
including
grass
and
alfalfa
or
clover
and
fermented
chopped
feed
called
that
is
usually
made
from
corn
wheat
or
barley


cows
are
often
kept
in
stalls
where
they
have
enough
room
to
lay
down
comfortably


such
large
dairies
must
supply
straw
or
saw
dust
for
the
cows
to
rest
on
without
getting
sore
from
the
hard
concrete
floor


cows
can
be
milked
by
hand
but
in
many
countries
where
there
are
large
dairies
the
cows
are
milked
by
a
milking
machine


the
milk
is
collected
in
a
large
<collocation>stainless steel</collocation>
container
where
it
undergoes
a
process
that
heats
milk
to
a
very
high
temperature
to
kill
any
bacteria
that
are
living
in
the
milk


the
milk
is
then
taken
by
truck
to
a
milk
or
dairy
factory
to
be
made
into
the
milk
we
drink
by
being
separated
to
remove
most
of
the
cream


it
is
then
put
into
bottles
or
cartons
to
be
sold


some
milk
is
also
turned
into
cheese
<collocation>ice cream</collocation>
butter
cream
and
even
yogurt


all
of
these
<collocation>dairy products</collocation>
are
packaged
or
put
into
cartons
or
bottles
and
sold


are
<collocation>dairy cattle</collocation>


many
types
of
cattle
are
used

they
include
the
australian

is
a

with
short

often
gray
as
well
with
a

the
guernsey
which
is
pale
red
to
yellow
and
white
and
also
give
a
lot
of
cream


the
holstein
which
is
large
spotted
black
and
white
some
cows
can
be
mostly
black
or
mostly
white
with
short
horns


some
holsteins
are
also
polled
or
hornless


the
jersey
which
is
small

fawn
or
dun
colored
with
a
dark
face
or
eye
patches
black
nose
hooves
and
front
part
of
the
lower
legs


some
jerseys
are
also
black
with
a
fawn
saddle
patch
over
their
back


they
do
not
give
as
much
milk
as
the
other
breeds
but
it
is
famous
for
the
amount
of
cream
they
produce


jerseys
can
be
horned
or
polled
with
horns
often
being
short
and
curving
upwards


the
milking
shorthorn
which
is
to
large
deep
red
to

short
upturned

sign
of
wealth


<collocation>beef cattle</collocation>
<collocation>beef cattle</collocation>
are
bred
and
raised
specifically
to
provide
meat
or
beef


steers
are
the
best
type
for
this
purpose
because
they
can
be
kept
in
herds
without
fighting
each
other


heifers
are
also
often
used
for
beef
especially
those
that
are
not
suitable
to
be
used
in
a
breeding
herd


the
cows
of
<collocation>beef cattle</collocation>
are
used
to
give
birth
to
and
raise
calves
for
meat


they
are
not
usually
used
for
milk
although
some
types
of
cattle
such
as
the
red
poll
dexter
or
red
devon
also
known
as
the
north
devon
or
devon
are
used
for
both


these
type
of
cattle
are
called
dual
purpose
breeds


<collocation>beef cattle</collocation>
are
often
allowed
graze
over
large
areas
because
they
do
not
have
to
be
brought
in

until
the
mid
century
<collocation>beef cattle</collocation>
were
often
sent

drovers
would
herd
the
cattle
along
the
roads
or
on
trails
to
the
cattle
markets
in
big
towns

cities
or
to
railway
stations
where
they
would
be
loaded
and
shipped
to
these
towns

cities


in
australia
sometimes
the
cattle
would
travel
for
hundreds
of
miles
along
roads
known
as
traveling
stock
routes


big
herds
would
have
thousands
of

the
meat
from
a
calf
is
called
veal
and
from
an
older
beast
beef


meat
that
is
cut
into
flat
pieces
for
frying

grilling
is
called
steak


every
part
of
a
beast
can
be
used


the
skin
becomes
leather


the
meat
which
is
not
used
by
humans
becomes
pet
food
and
almost
everything
that
is
left
over
becomes

oxen
oxen
are
cattle
trained
as
work
animals


the
word
ox
is
used
to
describe
just
one


they
are
castrated
males
steers


an
ox
is
over
four
years
old
and
grown
to
full
size
when
it
begins
to
work


oxen
are
used
for
pulling
plows
and
wagons
for
hauling
heavy
loads
like
logs
or
for
powering
different
machines
such
as
mills
and
irrigation
pumps

steers
were
used
to
pull
heavy
wagons
in
the
usa


oxen
are
most
often
used
in
teams
of
two
for
light
work
such
as
plowing


in
past
days
very
large
teams
of
fourteen
to
twenty
oxen
were
used
for
heavy
work
such
as
logging


the
oxen
are
put
into
pairs
and
each
pair
must
work
together


a
wooden
yoke
is
put
about
the
neck
of
each
pair
so
that
the
work
is
shared
across
their
shoulders


oxen
are
chosen
from
certain
breeds
with
horns
since
the
horns
hold
the
yoke
in
place
when
the
oxen
lower
their
heads
back
up
or
slow
down


oxen
must
be
trained
from
a
young
age


the
owner
must
make
or
buy
as
many
as
a
dozen
yokes
of
different
sizes
as
the
animals
grow


<collocation>ox teams</collocation>
are
steered
by
shouted
commands
whistles
or
the
noise
of
a
whip
crack


men
who
drove
<collocation>ox teams</collocation>
were
called
teamsters
in
america
in
britain
or
in
australia


many
and
teamsters
were
famous
for
their
voices
and
for
their
foul
language


oxen
can
pull
harder
and
longer
than
horses
especially
for
very
large
loads


they
are
not
as
fast
as
horses
but
they
are
less
often
injured
or
less
likely
to
startle
than
horses
are


many
oxen
are
still
in
use
all
over
the
world

in
poor
countries


traditions

the
yaks
are
treated

according
to
hinduism
the
cow
is
holy
and
should
not
be
eaten
the
cow
is
our
mother
for
she
gives
us
her
milk

in
portugal
spain
and
some
latin
american
countries
bulls
are
used
for
the
sport
of
bullfighting


in
many
other
countries
this
is
illegal


a
mistaken
idea
about
cattle
mostly
bulls
is
that
they
become
angry
when
they
see
the
color
red


this
is
not
correct


cattle
can
not
see
red
because
they
do
not
have
red
receptors
in
their
eyes


they
can
however
see
colors
such
as
blue
yellow
and
green
because
they
have
yellow
and
blue
receptors
in
their
eyes


this
mistake
comes
from
seeing
matadors
or
using
a
red
cape
to
encourage
a
bull
to
charge
at
them


but
really
red
is
a
color
that
is
only
used
as
part
of
spanish
tradition
and
culture


it
is
also
a
way
to
make
the
matador
more
visible
from
the
crowd
and
enables
people
in
the
crowd
to
easily
see
what
is
going
on
and
also
as
a
way
to
excite
them


thus
it
is
merely
the
motion
of
the
cape
that
makes
a
bull
charge
not
the
color


an
angry
bull
or
bull
that
is
threatening
you
will
charge
if
you
move
or
if
something
no
matter
the
color
is
waved
in
front
of
his
face
