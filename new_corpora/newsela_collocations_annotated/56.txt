english
orthography
or
english
spelling
is
the
way
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
are
used
to
write
down
the
sounds
of
english


the
first
manuscripts
in
old
english
were
written
using
the
latin
alphabet


it
had
letters


vowels
no
alphabet
fits
its
language
exactly


one
reason
for
this
is
that
there
are
always
more
sounds
than
letters


in
english
there
are
far
more
<collocation>vowel sounds</collocation>
than
vowels


the
ancient
greeks
who
were
the
first
to
use
letters
for
vowels
decided
to
use
only
a
few
letters
for
their
<collocation>vowel sounds</collocation>


this
choice
influenced
all
later
the
importance
of
the
greeks
in
the
history
of
writing
is
paramount


all
the
in
use
in
europe
today
stand
in
direct
or
<collocation>indirect relation</collocation>
to
the
ancient
greek


english
would
need
about
vowels
to
represent
the
<collocation>vowel phonemes</collocation>
sounds
in
common
use
and
some
languages
do
have
more
letters
for
vowels


the
georgian
language
has
a
total
of
letters


a
shorter
alphabet
works
by
using
two
or
three
letters
for
a
single
sound
or
one
letter
for
several
sounds


consonants
the
english
alphabet
has
only
three
consonants
which
have
one
sound
can
not
be
produced
by
other
combinations
and
are
never
silent
n
r
and
the
english
language
uses
to
consonant
phonemes


dialects
the
other
reason
that
never
exactly
fit
languages
is
dialect


a
spoken
language
varies
from
place
to
place
and
from
time
to
time


this
is
very
obvious
with
english
as
the
pronunciation
is
so
different
in
different
parts
of
the
world


a
written
language
will
always
be
less
flexible
than
its
spoken
parent


it
has
a
different
function
and
is
produced
mechanically


it
must
serve
everyone
who
speaks
the
language
and
it
does
this
by
keeping
the
spelling
similar
from
one
time
to
another


therefore
all
have
sounds
which
are
difficult
to
represent
with
the
letters
in
use


that
gives
rise
to
problems
of
spelling


british
and
american
english
differences
between
american
english
and
british
english
spelling
came
about
mainly
as
the
result
of
one
man


noah
webster
wrote
a
grammar
a
spelling
book
and
finally
an
american
dictionary
of
the
english
language


in
the
course
of
this
he
proposed
a
number
of
in
spelling


in
his
dictionary
he
chose
over
c
in
words
like
defense
he
changed
the
re
to
er
in
words
like
center
he
dropped
one
of
the
ls
in
traveler


at
first
he
kept
the
u
in
words
like
color
or
favor
but
dropped
it
in
later
editions


he
also
changed
tongue
to
tung
that
did
not
stick


his
main
reason
was
to
help
children
learn
to
read
and
write


webster
dictionary
contained
seventy
thousand
words
of
which
twelve
thousand
had
never
appeared
in
a
published
dictionary
before


webster
did
create
a
slightly
different
identity
for
american
english


but
because
his
efforts
left
the
most
glaring
problems
his
variations
make
little
difference
to
the
way
the
language
is
used


an
example
of
the
real
problems
in
english
orthography
is
the
word
ending
ough
which
is
pronounced
several
different
ways
tough
bough
cough
the
root
causes
of
spelling
variation
are
historical
and
loan
words
come
with
their
own
foreign
spelling


either
all
french
loan
words
should
be
left
as
they
were
or
they
all
should
be
changed


either
we
should
move
wholesale
to
a
more
<collocation>phonetic spelling</collocation>
or
not


this
was
proposed
by
many
people
since
webster
such
as
george
bernard
shaw
who
proposed
a
new
phonetic
alphabet
for
english


in
some
cases
webster
changes
have
been
widely
adopted
in
britain
the
spelling
program
came
from
the
french
us
program
is
clearly
simpler
and
more
consistent
with
word
endings
in
english


in
our
modern
world
english
orthography
is
still
a
problem


in
some
countries
notably
france
a
national
committee
can
give
advice
and
direction
as
to
spelling


english
has
long
escaped
from
national
custody


spelling
though
important
is
less
important
than
how
the
language
is
used
in
practice


the
differences
between
british
and
american
english
in
use
are
more
to
do
with
idiom
slang
and
vocabulary
than
they
are
to
do
with
spelling


in
this
respect
spelling
in
writing
or
print
is
a
bit
like
pronunciation
in
speech


they
are
the
necessary
outer
clothes
but
the
inner
substance
is
more
important


in
note
the
spelling
articles
may
be
in
either
american
or
british
english
but
should
be
consistent
within
each
article

british
spelling
and
use
was
greatly
influenced
by
the
two
great
english
dictionaries
samuel
johnson
a
dictionary
of
the
english
language
and
james
murray
oxford
english
dictionary


johnson
dictionary
was
hugely
influential
abroad
as
well
as
at
home


the
dictionary
was
exported
to
america


the
american
adoption
of
the
dictionary
was
a
<collocation>momentous event</collocation>
not
just
in
its
history
but
in
the
history
of


for
americans
in
the
second
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
johnson
was
the
authority
on
language
and
the
subsequent
development
of
american
dictionaries
was
colored
by
his
fame


for
american
the
dictionary
was
impossible
to
ignore
america
two
great
noah
webster
and
joseph
<collocation>emerson worcester</collocation>
argued
fiercely
over
johnson
legacy
in
webster
declared
that
great
britain
whose
children
we
are
and
whose
language
we
speak
should
no
longer
be
our
standard
for
the
taste
of
her
writers
is
already
corrupted
and
her
language
on
the
decline


where
webster
found
fault
with
johnson
joseph
worcester
saluted
him
in
he
completed
his
universal
and
critical
dictionary
of
the
english
language


some
people
argue
which
language
is
the
easiest
to
spell


people
who
learn
a
second
language
tend
to
think
that
their
first
native
language
is
the
easiest


however
for
the
learner
<collocation>programmatic languages</collocation>
with
rules
are
easier
to
start
with
than
english


the
spelling
of
the
english
language
is
by
far
the
most
irregular
of
all
spellings
and
thus
the
most
difficult
to
learn


english
is
in
its
origin
a
germanic
language


from
its
early
roots
as
it
has
borrowed
words
from
many
other
languages
french
a
romance
language
and
latin
are
the
most
frequent
donors
to
english


languages
that
use
<collocation>phonetic spelling</collocation>
are
easier
to
learn
to
spell
than
others


with
<collocation>phonetic spelling</collocation>
the
words
are
spelled
as
they
are
pronounced


the
italian
word
for
instance
is
pronounced
gi
always
making
a
j
sound


in
english
one
comes
across
the
word
knife


in
knife
the
k
is
not
spoken
even
though
in
english
it
more
common
to
pronounce
k
when
they
are
in
words


history
of
english
spelling
one
of
the
problems
we
have
is
that
similar
sounding
words
may
be
spelt
quite
differently


rough
and
ruff
meet
and
meat
great
and
grate


words
with
complicated
spelling
may
be
pronounced
simply
leicester
is
pronounced
lester


even
what
rules
we
do
have
are
frequently
broken


i
before
e
except
after
c
has
over
exceptions


almost
all
these
problems
have
come
about
for
historical
reasons


english
has
been
changing
for
the
last
thousand
years
and
as
the
language
changes
so
parts
of
it
get
stuck
with
different
spellings


here
are
some
of
the
causes
of
english
orthography
originally
a
alphabet
for
the
or
so
phonemes
sounds
of

many
of

to

here
is
what
happened
over
a

the

changed

is
still

in

differences
between
languages
some
languages
have
a
high
correspondence
between
phonemes
and
letters


that
means
they
get
close
to
one
letter
for
each
sound


if
there
was
a
<collocation>perfect correspondence</collocation>
that
language
would
have

english
is
highly


it
has
almost
every
kind
of
deviation
known
different
letters
for
the

two

this

is

<collocation>orthographic depth</collocation>


the
<collocation>orthographic depth</collocation>
of
an
script
is
the
degree
to
which
a
written
language
deviates
from
simple
letter
correspondence


it
shows
how
easy
it
is
to
predict
the
pronunciation
of
a
word
from
its
spelling


shallow
are
easy
to
pronounce
based
on
the
written
word
and
deep
are
difficult
to
pronounce
based
on
how
they
are
written


in
shallow
the
correspondence
is
direct
given
the
rules
of
pronunciation
one
is
able
to
say
the
word
correctly


most
other
international
languages
have
similar
problems
in

hebrew
