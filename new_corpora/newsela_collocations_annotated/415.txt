early
greek
myths
and
legends


the
traditional

however

it
talks

king
agamemnon


the
story
itself
covers
only
a

talks

the
story

the
wrath
of
achilles
to

<collocation>caffeine molecule</collocation>


caffeine
is
a
common
drug
according
to
the
who
a
drug
is
a
substance
that
can
change
how
a
living
organism
works


food
is
usually
not
seen
as
a
drug
even
though
some
foods
may
have
such
properties


most
of
the
time
drugs
are
taken
to
treat
a
disease
or
other
medical
condition


an
example
for
such
drugs
may
be
aspirin
or


these
are
usually
given
to
treat
fever
as
well
as
certain
infections


if
such
drugs
are
taken
over
a
longer
time
they
are
usually
prescribed
by
a
doctor


other
drugs
are
taken
for
fun
because
of
the
effect
they
have


some
of
these
drugs
taken
for
fun
are
better
accepted
by
society
than
others


having
or
taking
certain
drugs
may
be
illegal
in
certain
countries


drugs
that
are
taken
to
treat
a
disease
or
condition
are
usually
called
therapeutic
drugs
that
are
taken
for
fun
are
called
recreational
drugs


drugs
may
have
other
effects
than
those
wanted


such
effects
are
generally
known
as


drugs
act
differently
in
different
amounts


it
is
therefore
important
to
take
the
right
amount


the
amount
of
the
drug
taken
is
called
a
dose


aspirin
is
often
prescribed
against
fever
or
as
an
analgesic


one
of
the
of
aspirin
is
that
it
makes
the
blood
thinner


for
this
reason
it
can
also
be
used
to
prevent
strokes
or
heart
attacks
in
a
much
lower
dose
than
the
one
used
to
treat
fever
though


taking
too
much
of
a
drug
too
high
a
dose
can
cause
sickness
or
even
death


when
a
doctor
says
how
much
of
a
drug
the
right
dose
to
take
only
that
amount
should
be
taken


it
is
very
important
to
keep
taking
the
drug
until
the
doctor
says
to
stop
because
someone
can
feel
better
but
still
be
sick


when
a
doctor
says
what
drug
to
take
how
much
of
it
and
for
how
long
it
is
called
a
prescription


drugs
may
cause
addiction


some
drugs
are
illegal
because
they
are
very
addictive


these
drugs
are
really
expensive
too


it
can
also
be
sold
illegally
from
drug
sellers
which
may
cause
serious
<collocation>results recreational</collocation>
<collocation>drugs recreational</collocation>
drugs
can
sometimes
be
bad
for
someone
health
even
if
they
make
them
feel
good


alcohol
can
also
be
dangerous
if
the
person
drinking
it
drives
a
vehicle
after
drinking


this
is
called
drunk
driving


many
countries
make
this
against
the
law


common
<collocation>recreational drugs</collocation>
include
alcohol
in
beer
wine
and
hard
liquor
nicotine
in
cigarette
caffeine
in
coffee
and
see
figure
cannabis
smoked
like
cigarettes
or
baked
in
something
to
eat
like
a
cake
or
brownie
methamphetamine
also
known
as
crystal
meth
can
be
smoked
eaten
injected
or

d
cocaine
can
be

or
inhaled
freebasing
heroin
can
be

injected
or
smoked
in
its
freebase
form


<collocation>certain recreational</collocation>
drugs
also
have
uses
as
a
<collocation>therapeutic drug</collocation>


heroin
can
be
used
as
an
analgesic
a
painkiller
and
methamphetamine
is
used
to
treat
narcolepsy
or


<collocation>recreational drugs</collocation>
can
be
dangerous
certain
countries
have
made
it
illegal
to
have
or
take
them
outside
a
medical
context


most
of
the
time
this
is
because
they
can
be
addictive
or
that
they
are
very
dangerous
when
combined
with
other
drugs


that
way
products
are
legal
in
the
netherlands
but
illegal
in
many
other
countries


alcohol
and
nicotine
are
legal
almost
everywhere
but
there
are
a
lot
of
taxes
on
the
sale
of
these


in
other
words
they
are
expensive
to
buy


being
expensive
to
buy
because
of
taxes
has
two
benefits
one
is
that
the
taxes
collected
from
the
sale
of
the
drugs
goes
into
helping
to
pay
for
assistance
the
drug
user
may
experience
later


a
smoker
for
example
may
develop
cancer
later
in
life
and
need
treatment
at
a
place
that
is
granted
a
certain
amount
of
tax
money
from
the
government
to
keep
it
operating


another
benefit
to
the
taxing
of
legal
drugs
is
that
the
high
price
may
stop
people
from
beginning
the
habit
in
the
first
place
which
will
help
them
avoid
the
negative
medical
or
addictive
side
effects
of
the
drug


in
some
cases
not
everyone
is
allowed
to
buy
these
drugs
unless
they
are
a
minimal
age
to
do
so


the
age
at
which
someone
is
allowed
to
buy
a
legal
drug
is
most
often
decided
by
the
government
of
a
country
state
or
province
and
is
usually
the
age
where
a
person
is
considered
by
the
law
to
be
an
adult


some
of
the
most
common
ages
this
happens
is
at
or
years
of
age
