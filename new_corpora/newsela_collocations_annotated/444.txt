notice
ido
is
a
planned
language
a
reformed
esperanto
which
was
developed
in


ido
was
made
by
a
group
of
people
that
thought
esperanto
was
too
hard
to
be
a
world
language


they
did
not
like
how
esperanto
used
letters
with
special
marks
over
them
because
that
made
it
hard
to
type
and
they
thought
that
a
world
language
should
be
easy
to
learn
and
write


ido
is
not
as
popular
as
esperanto
but
still
about
people
in
the
world
speak
it


they
have
a
conference
every
year
where
people
come
together
and
speak
the

special
points
about
ido
ido
is
easy
to
learn
for
many
reasons
the
speaker
says
ido
the
same
way
it
is
written


in
english
the
words
doughnut
tough
and
through
all
have
the
<collocation>letters ough</collocation>
but
the
speaker
says
them
differently


in
ido
the
word
is
the
word
is
and
so
on


verbs
action
words
all
act
the
same
in
english
the
speaker
says
i
learn
you
learn
we
learn
she
learns


in
ido
the
verb
is
always
the
same
lang
io
me
tu
ni
el


ido
looks
like
a
lot
of
other
languages


if
learners
already
know
english
french
or
some
other
european
language
they
can
probably
understand
a
lot
of
ido
even
without
studying
it


lang
io
me
mea
en
la
means
i
learn
with
my
friend
in
the
school


a
person
can
see
that
the
word
for
i
looks
like
me
is
learn
and
is
school


also
if
the
person
is
french
they
will
know
the
word
which
means
friend
and
looks
like
the
french
word
ami
or
amie


it
also
resembles
the
italian
word
and
the
word
amigo


grammar
how
to
use
the
language
each
word
in
ido
comes
from
a
smaller
word
called
a
root
word


a
root
word
has
a
root
and
an
ending


the
speaker
can
take
the
root
and
put
it
on
another
word
to
make
a
new
one


for
example
means
city
and
means
leader


the
root
of
is
and
if
is
put
on
the
end
it
becomes
which
means
mayor
leader
of
a
city


or
the
speaker
can
put
something
on
before
chef
means
chief
or
leader
and
if
the
speaker
puts
that
before
the
word
it
becomes
which
means
capital
city


here
are
some
of
the
endings

pronouns
are
the
words
in
a
language
like

he

and
so
on


ido
was
made
from
esperanto
and
all
of
esperanto
pronouns
end
in
the
people
that
made
ido
thought
that
they
sounded
too
much
the
same
and
that
it
might
be
too
difficult
to
hear
sometimes


also
most
languages
have
two
ways
of
saying
you
so
they
decided
to
have
two
ways
of
saying
you


lastly
they
decided
to
make
a
pronoun
that
can
mean
he
or
she


some
languages
like
the
finnish
language
and
the
estonian
language
have
something
like
this

and

so
they
look

similar


since

more
speakers
than

most
people
that
know

first
learned

and
then
later
learned
that

sometimes
people
who

people
who
speak

do

they
both
agree

sometimes
used
to
show
where

paragraph
begins


a
paragraph
is
a
group
of
words
put
together
to
form
a
group
that
is
usually
longer
than
a
sentence


paragraphs
are
often
made
up
of
many
sentences


they
are
usually
between
four
to
eight
sentences


paragraphs
can
begin
with
an
indentation
about
five
spaces
or
by
missing
a
line
out
and
then
starting
again
this
makes
telling

ends

used
to
give
basic
knowledge
about
the

used

why
your
thesis
is

the

after

has
completed

sometimes
used
to

paragraphs
help
separate
