he
used
this
term
because
he
thought
that
if
a
solid
malignant
tumor
was
cut
into
its
veins
looked
like
a
crab
the
veins
stretched
on
all
sides
as
the
animal
the
crab
has
its
feet
whence
it
derives
gets
its
name


hippocrates
later
added
greek
for
swelling
after
the
word


this
is
how
the
word
carcinoma
came
about


because
the
ancient
greeks
did
not
believe
in
opening
up
dead
bodies
to
study
them
hippocrates
was
only
able
to
describe
and
make
drawings
of
tumors
he
saw
from
the
outside
of
the
body


he
drew
tumors
that
had
been
on
the
skin
nose
and
breasts


hippocrates
and
other
doctors
at
that
time
treated
people
based
on
the
humor
theory


this
theory
said
that
there
were
four
types
of
fluid
in
the
body
black
<collocation>yellow bile</collocation>
blood
and
phlegm


doctors
tried
to
figure
out
whether
the
patient
four
humors
or
body
fluids
were
in
balance


they
would
then
use
treatments
like
cutting
the
patient
and
letting
him
bleed
so
that
he
would
lose
blood
laxatives
giving
the
patient
foods
or
herbs
to
make
him
go
to
the
bathroom
changing
the
patient
diet


the
doctors
that
these
treatments
would
work
to
get
the
patient
four
humors
back
into
the
right
balance


the
humor
theory
treatment
was
popular
until
the
century
the
when
cells
were
discovered


by
this
time
people
had
realized
that
cancer
can
happen
anywhere
in
the
body


the
oldest
known
document
that
talks
about
cancer
was
discovered
in
egypt
and
is
thought
to
be
from
about


the
document
talks
about
using
surgery
to
treat
eight
cases
of
ulcers
of
the
breast


these
were
treated
by
cauterization
by
burning
them
using
a
tool
called
the
fire
drill


the
document
also
says
about
cancer
there
is
no
treatment


another
very
early
type
of
surgery
used
to
treat
cancer
was
written
about
in
the


in
the
canon
of
medicine
sina
said
that
treatment
should
involve
a
radical
excision
or
removal
through
surgery
of
all
diseased
tissue


this
included
the
use
of
amputation
removing
a
part
of
the
body
completely
or
removing
veins
that
ran
in
the
direction
of
the
tumor


also
suggested
that
the
area
that
had
been
treated
should
be
cauterized
or
burned
if
needed


in
the
and
centuries
the
and
doctors
started
to
be
allowed
to
dissect
bodies
or
cut
them
open
after
death
in
order
to
figure
out
the
cause
of
death


around
this
time
there
were
many
different
ideas
about
what
caused
cancer


the
german
professor
believed
that
<collocation>breast cancer</collocation>
was
caused
by
a
clot
of
milk
in
the
part
of
a
woman
breast
that
produces
milk


the
dutch
professor
de
la
boe
sylvius
believed
that
all
disease
was
caused
by
chemical
processes


he
thought
that
cancer
in
particular
was
caused
by
<collocation>acidic lymph</collocation>


who
lived
at
the
same
time
as
sylvius
believed
that
cancer
was
a
poison
that
slowly
spreads
and
was
contagious


a
british
surgeon
named
was
the
first
person
to
figure
out
one
of
the
real
causes
of
cancer


in
he
discovered
that
cancer
of
the
scrotum
was
a
common
disease
among
chimney
sweeps
people
who
cleaned
out
chimneys


other
doctors
started
studying
this
topic
and
coming
up
with
other
ideas
about
what
<collocation>causes cancer</collocation>


doctors
then
started
working
together
and
coming
up
with
better
ideas


in
the
century
the
the
microscope
started
to
be
used
by
many
people
and
this
made
a
big
difference
in
helping
doctors
and
scientists
understand
more
about
cancer


using
the
microscope
scientists
were
able
to
see
that
the
cancer
poison
spread
from
one
tumor
through
the
lymph
nodes
to
other
sites
metastasis


this
was
first
made
clear
by
the
english
surgeon
campbell
de
morgan
between
and


before
the
century
the
using
surgery
to
treat
cancer
usually
had
bad
results


doctors
did
not
understand
how
important
hygiene
or
keeping
things
clean
is
for
preventing
disease
especially
after
surgery


because
things
were
not
kept
clean
during
or
after
surgery
patients
often
got
infections
and
died


for
example
one
scottish
surgeon
alexander
kept
records
and
found
that
patients
out
of
every
who
had
surgery
for
<collocation>breast tumors</collocation>
died
within
the
next
two
years


in
the
century
surgical
hygiene
got
better
because
of
doctors
realized
that
dirtiness
and
germs
cause
infection
and
they
started
to
keep
things
cleaner
and
do
things
to
kill
germs
in
order
to
prevent
their
patients
from
getting
infections


as
it
became
more
common
for
people
to
survive
after
having
surgery
<collocation>surgical removal</collocation>
of
the
tumor
taking
the
tumor
out
of
the
body
by
doing
surgery
became
the
treatment
for
cancer


for
this
kind
of
treatment
to
work
the
surgeon
doing
the
operation
had
to
be
very
good
at
removing
tumors


this
meant
that
even
if
people
had
the
same
kind
of
cancer
they
could
get
very
different
results
with
some
getting
good
treatment
that
worked
and
others
getting
treatment
that
did
not
work
because
of
differences
in
how
good
different
surgeons
were


in
the
late
doctors
and
scientists
started
to
realize
that
the
body
is
made
up
of
many
kinds
of
tissues
which
in
turn
are
made
up
of
millions
of
cells


this
discovery
made
it
clear
once
and
for
all
that
the
old
theories
about
body
humors
causing
diseases
were
not
correct


the
discovery
also
started
the
age
of
cellular
pathology
studying
cells
to
learn
about
diseases
and
figure
out
what
is
wrong
with
the
body


also
in
the
late
a
team
of
scientists
<collocation>marie curie</collocation>
and
<collocation>pierre curie</collocation>
discovered
radiation


by
discovering
radiation
the
curies
had
found
the
first
effective
<collocation>cancer treatment</collocation>
the
first
treatment
that
worked
and
did
not
involve
surgery


radiation
also
began
the
first
signs
of
approaches
to
<collocation>cancer treatment</collocation>
meaning
that
people
doing
different
jobs
were
working
together
to
<collocation>treat patients</collocation>


the
surgeon
was
no
longer
working
by
himself
he
worked
together
with
hospital
radiologists
people
who
gave
and
read
to
help
patients


this
team
approach
meant
that
some
major
changes
had
to
be
made


the
different
people
on
the
team
had
to
communicate
with
each
other
and
work
together
which
they
were
not
used
to
doing


it
also
meant
that
treatment
had
to
be
done
in
a
hospital
rather
than
at
the
patient
home


because
of
this
patients
information
had
to
be
put
together
into
files
kept
at
the
hospital
called
medical
records


because
this
information
was
now
being
kept
and
written
down
scientists
were
able
to
do
the
first
<collocation>statistical patient</collocation>
studies
which
use
numbers
to
describe
different
things
like
how
many
people
who
have
a
certain
type
of
cancer
or
get
a
certain
treatment
survive


another
important
step
forward
in
understanding
cancer
happened
in
when
janet
published
a
paper
on
<collocation>cancer epidemiology</collocation>


epidemiology
is
a
field
of
study
which
looks
at
how
common
a
disease
is
what
patterns
the
disease
takes
in
different
kinds
of
people
and
what
this
means
for
understanding
and
treating
the
disease


this
historic
paper
was
a
comparative
study
which
tries
to
find
out
what
causes
a
disease
by
looking
at
a
group
of
people
who
have
the
disease
and
figuring
out
how
they
are
different
from
another
group
that
does
not
have
the
disease


study
looked
at
people
who
all
had
the
same
background
and
lifestyle
or
way
of
living
people
with
<collocation>breast cancer</collocation>
and
control
patients
people
without
<collocation>breast cancer</collocation>


these
people
were
the
same
in
many
ways
but
some
got
<collocation>breast cancer</collocation>
and
some
did
not


to
figure
out
what
might
be
causing
certain
people
to
get
<collocation>breast cancer</collocation>
the
study
looked
at
what
was
different
about
these
people
when
they
were
compared
to
or
looked
at
alongside
the
people
who
did
not
get
cancer


study
was
published
by
the
british
ministry
of
health


her
work
on
<collocation>cancer epidemiology</collocation>
was
continued
by
richard
doll
and
austin
hill


they
used
the
same
ways
of
studying
cancer
as
but
they
looked
at
a
different
kind
of
cancer
<collocation>lung cancer</collocation>


in
they
published
their
results
in
a
paper
called
<collocation>lung cancer</collocation>
and
other
causes
of
death
in
relation
to
smoking


a
second
report
on
the
mortality
of
british
doctors
also
called
the
british
doctors
study


later
richard
doll
left
the
london
medical
research
center
and
started
the
oxford
unit
for
<collocation>cancer epidemiology</collocation>
in


by
using
computers
this
unit
was
able
to
do
something
new
and
very
important
it
brought
together
large
amounts
of
cancer
data
pieces
of
information
about
cancer


this
way
of
studying
cancer
is
very
important
to
<collocation>cancer epidemiology</collocation>
today
and
it
has
also
been
very
important
in
shaping
what
we
now
know
about
cancer
and
what
the
rules
and
laws
about
the
disease
and
public
health
are
today


over
the
past
years
many
different
people
have
done
a
lot
of
work
to
collect
data
from
different
doctors
hospitals
areas
states
and
even
countries


this
data
is
used
to
study
whether
different
kinds
of
cancer
are
more
or
less
common
in
different
areas
environments
for
example
in
big
cities
compared
to
the
countryside
or
cultures


this
helps
people
who
study
cancer
to
figure
out
what
makes
people
more
or
less
to
get
different
kinds
of
cancer


before
<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii
doctors
and
hospitals
were
getting
better
at
collecting
or
getting
and
keeping
data
about
their
patients
who
had
cancer
but
it
was
not
very
common
for
this
data
to
be
shared
with
other
doctors
or
hospitals


this
changed
after
when
medical
research
centers
found
out
that
different
countries
had
very
different
incidences
of
cancer
meaning
that
cancer
was
much
more
common
in
some
countries
than
in
others


because
of
this
many
countries
created
national
public
health
organizations
which
studied
public
health
issues
in
an
entire
country


these
national
public
health
organizations
began
to
bring
together
health
data
from
many
different
doctors
and
hospitals


this
helped
them
figure
out
some
of
the
reasons
why
cancer
was
so
much
more
common
in
certain
places


for
example
in
japan
people
studying
cancer
found
out
that
people
who
had
survived
the
atomic
bombings
of
hiroshima
and
nagasaki
had
bone
marrow
that
was
completely
destroyed


this
helped
them
realize
that
<collocation>diseased bone</collocation>
marrow
could
also
be
destroyed
with
radiation
which
was
a
very
important
step
in
figuring
out
that
leukemia
a
blood
cancer
can
be
treated
with
bone
marrow
transplants


since
<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii
scientists
have
kept
finding
better
cancer
treatments


however
there
are
some
things
that
still
need
to
get
better


for
example
while
there
are
good
treatments
for
many
kinds
of
cancer
there
are
still
no
treatments
for
certain
kinds
of
cancer
or
for
some
cancers
once
they
progress
or
get
worse
to
a
certain
stage
of
the
disease


also
the
cancer
treatments
that
do
exist
are
not
all
standardized
there
is
not
one
way
of
giving
every
treatment
which
is
used
each
time
the
treatment
is
given


cancer
treatments
are
also
not
available
everywhere
in
the
world


people
need
to
keep
studying
<collocation>cancer epidemiology</collocation>
and
forming
international
partnerships
where
different
countries
work
together
to
find
cures
and
make
cancer
treatments
available
everywhere

a

there
is
a
special
piece
of
glass
in

called
a

makes
a

the

does
this
by

one
type

another
difference

films
have
a

main
<collocation>digital camera</collocation>
<collocation>digital photography</collocation>
is
photography
done
using
a
<collocation>digital camera</collocation>


sometimes
it
is
called
<collocation>digital imaging</collocation>


a
<collocation>digital camera</collocation>
has
a
lens
aperture
and
shutter


the
picture
the
lens
makes
is
recorded
by
a
<collocation>electronic sensor</collocation>


a
<collocation>digital camera</collocation>
does
not
use
<collocation>photographic film</collocation>
to
record
a
picture


digital
photographs
are
stored
in
a
computer
but
paper
prints
can
also
be
made
from
digital
pictures


<collocation>digital cameras</collocation>
are
also
not
expensive
to
use
as
there
is
no
film
to
buy


taking
a
photograph
the
most
important
thing
when
taking
a
photograph
is
focusing
the
lens


if
the
lens
does
not
focus
the
picture
well
the
photograph
will
be
blurry


cameras
focus
automatically
when
the
shutter
release
is
pressed


there
are
also
<collocation>manual focus</collocation>
cameras
usually
older
ones


three
other
things
are
important
when
taking
a
photograph


these
control
how
bright
or
dark
the
photograph
will
be


the
shutter
speed
how
long
the
shutter
is
open
for


this
is
written
in
the
form
or
one
of
a
second


the
aperture
how
big
the
shutter
opens


this
changes
how
much
light
is
let
in


this
is
written
in
the
form
which
describes
the
ratio
between
<collocation>focal length</collocation>
and
shutter
opening


the
film
speed
how
quickly
the
film
records
the
picture


this
is
also
called
iso
and
is
written
in
the
form


a
slow
shutter
speed
a
bigger
aperture
and
a
fast
film
will
make
a
brighter
picture


a
fast
shutter
speed
a
small
aperture
and
a
slow
film
will
give
a
darker
picture


a
good
picture
is
not
too
bright
and
not
too
dark


an
automatic
camera
changes
these
things
by
itself
when
the
shutter
release
is
pressed


an
acronym
is
a
word
whose
letters
are
the
first
letters
of
other
words


people
often
create
a
short
acronym
that
means
the
same
thing
as
a
much
longer
phrase
set
of
words


this
is
faster
and
shorter
to
say
then

radio
waves
make
up
part
of
the
<collocation>electromagnetic spectrum</collocation>


these
waves
are
packets
of
energy
with
differing
wavelengths
similar
to
visible
light
waves
or
<collocation>gamma rays</collocation>
except
longer


a
radio
wave
like
other
electromagnetic
waves
is
similar
to
an
ocean
wave
or
any
other
type
of
wave


both
types
of
wave
have
a
hill
and
valley
shape
repeating
over
and
over


a
wavelength
is
measured
as
the
distance
from
the
top
of
one
crest
to
the
top
of
its
neighboring
crest


while
the
wavelength
of
visible
light
is
very
very
small
less
than
one
micrometer
and
much
less
than
the
thickness
of
a
human
hair
radio
waves
can
have
a
wavelength
from
a
couple
centimeters
to
several
meters


the
smallest
radio
waves
are
called
microwaves


are
not
quite
so
small


there
are
also
medium
and
long
waves


antennas
designed
to
send
and
receive
radio
waves
are
usually
similar
in
size
to
the
wavelength
they
are
to
use


this
is
why
many
radio
antennas
like
those
on
cars
must
be
long


if
the
antennas
are
not
close
to
the
size
of
the
wavelength
they
do
not
usually
do
a
good
job
of
detecting
the
waves
