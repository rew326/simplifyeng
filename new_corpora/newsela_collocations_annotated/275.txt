to

from

people
around

in

a
large

is
served
usually
bread
tea
egg
bacon
ham
fruits
baked
beans
on

and
sometimes
vegetables


in

people
usually
eat
a

often
bread
and
coffee
with
milk


in

most

eat
rice
instead

they
also
sometimes
eat

moving

fasting
when

an
example
of
a
small
town
in
iceland
a
town
is
usually
a
place
with
a
lot
of
houses
but
not
a
city


as
with
cities
there
is
more
than
one
way
to
say
what
a
town
is
in
different
countries


in
some
places
it
is
a
kind
of
local
government


in
english
they
also
use
the
word
town
as
a
general
word
for
places
with
a
lot
of
houses
cities
too


when
they
say
town
they
are
normally
thinking
of
a
big
important
place


for
example
london
is
a
city
but
people
often
call
it
london
town
the
city
of
london
is
a
part
of
london
where
there
are
a
lot
of
banks


also
going
from
the
outside
to
central
london
is
to
go
into
town


generally
the
difference
between
towns
and
villages
or
hamlets
is
the
sort
of
economy
they
have


people
in
towns
usually
get
money
from
industry
factories
commerce
shops
and
public
service
working
for
the
town
not
agriculture
growing
food


the
number
of
people
who
live
in
a
place
does
not
tell
us
if
it
is
a
town
or
a
village


in
many
areas
of
the
world
for
example
india
a
big
village
can
have
many
more
people
than
a
small
town


it
is
also
difficult
to
say
if
a
place
is
a
town
because
today
some
towns
are
becoming
bigger
and
in
some
places
people
live
in
a
village
or
near
a
town
and
work
in
the
town


sometimes
a
place
is
a
city
because
it
got
the
name
city
by
law


however
people
often
say
it
is
a
town
because
it
is
small


in
the
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>
a
place
became
a
town
by
means
of
a
charter
which
gave
it
town
privileges


the
united
states
in
the
united
states
of
america
the
meaning
of
the
term
town
is
different
in
each
state


in
some
states
a
town
is
a
town
if
the
state
says
it
is


in
other
states
for
example
wisconsin
a
town
is
a
subdivision
of
a
county
same
as
a
parish
in
louisiana


in
other
states
for
example
michigan
the
name
town
has
no
official
meaning
and
people
use
it
for
any
place
with
a
lot
of
people


in
the
six
new
england
states
a
town
is
a
smaller
part
of
the
county
and
in
these
states
really
a
more
important
part
than
the
county


in
connecticut
and
island
counties
are
only
on
the
map
and
have
no
power


in
the
other
four
states
counties
are
mostly
places
with
law
powers


the
counties
with
other
functions
are
mostly
in
new
hampshire
and
vermont


in
all
six
towns
do
things
that
in
most
states
counties
do


in
many
of
these
towns
town
meetings
are
the
main
form
of
government
so
citizens
can
say
what
happens
where
they
live
by
direct
democracy


in
<collocation>new york</collocation>
a
town
is
also
a
smaller
part
of
the
county
but
with
less
importance
than
in
new
england


in
<collocation>new york</collocation>
a
town
gives
people
more
direct
power
than
its
county
giving
almost
all
town
services
to
places
not
in
towns
called
hamlets
and
some
services
to
places
in
towns
called
villages


in
<collocation>new york</collocation>
a
town
usually
has
some
hamlets
and
villages


but
because
villages
have
power
without
towns
they
are
independent
they
can
be
in
two
towns
or
even
two
counties

or
villages


in
virginia
a
town
is
similar
to
a
city
but
it
can
have
a

number
of
people
in
it


by

law
cities
are
independent
of
counties
they
have
power
without

the
name
city
is
only
for
places
that
have
a
royal
charter
a
special
paper
saying
they
can
have
that
name


in
the
past
cities
usually
had
a
cathedral


some
english
people
think
that
when
a
place
has
a
cathedral
it
must
be
a
city
but
it
is
not
true
today


for
example
is
a

it
has
a

in

usually
a

not
