the
titanic
was
a
british
passenger
ship


it
was
built
by
and
ship
builders
in
belfast
for
the
white
star
line
company


before
it
sailed
many
people
thought
it
would

almost
impossible
for
it
to
sink

at

on

during

maiden
voyage
she
hit
an
iceberg
in
the
atlantic
ocean


the
iceberg
broke
the
titanic
hull
bottom
letting
water
into
the
ship


the
titanic
sank
two
hours
and
forty
minutes
later
at
am
on
april


as
she
sank
the
titanic
split
in
two


it
killed
around
people


only
around
people
survived


it
was
one
of
the
<collocation>worst shipwrecks</collocation>
that
was
not
during
a
war


one
reason
why
so
many
people
died
was
because
the
ship
did
not
have
enough
lifeboats


women
and
children
were
allowed
on
the
lifeboats
first
and
passengers
who
sailed
in
first
class
which
meant
that
they
paid
for
better
rooms
on
the
ship
were
allowed
on
before
other
passengers


not
many
lifeboats
had
been
provided
because
the
titanic
was
said
to
be
unsinkable


people
in
working
class
and
lower
classes
did
not
have
much
of
a
chance
of
getting
out
safely
but
the
higher
class
women
and
children
would
have
gone
out
on
the
first
few
lifeboats


another
reason
so
few
people
survived
was
that
the
radio
was
off
on
the
ss
californian
the
ship
closest
to
the
titanic
and
the
crew
did
not
hear
about
the
accident


another
ship
the
ss
did
hear
about
the
accident
and
collected
all
survivors


last
survivor
the
last
survivor
of
the
titanic
disaster
to
die
was
a
lady
named
dean


she
was
the
youngest
passenger
on
board
as
she
was
then
a
baby
of
only
nine
weeks
old


she
died
in
hampshire
england
on
may
aged


effects
the
titanic
disaster
changed
shipping
laws


changes
included
requiring
all
ships
to
carry
enough
lifeboats
for
everyone
on
the
ship
and
for
ships
to
have
someone
at
the
radio
all
the
time


discovery
the
wreck
was
found
by
a
french
and
american
team
led
by
robert
ballard
on
september
at
in
the
morning


in
ballard
returned
to
the
wreck
with
a
submarine


he
took
many
photos
and
made
lots
of
films


in
a
french
team
salvaged
objects
and
took
them
to
the
surface


culture
the
story
of
the
sinking
has
been
made
into
several
movies


the
most
popular
film
version
is
a
film
starring
and
leonardo
called
titanic


it
won
academy
awards
tying
for
the
record
for
the
most
academy
awards
won
by
one
movie


other
movie
versions
of
the
story
include
the
film
a
night
to
remember
the
film
titanic
the
film

and
the
film

in
the
film
raise
the
titanic
salvagers
raise
the
shipwreck

the
bottom
of
the
ocean
to

however
this
is
impossible
to
do
in
reality


the
titanic
broke
in
two
and
the
wreck
is
partially
stuck
in
the
bottom


it
has
been
there
more
than
years
and

more
pieces
