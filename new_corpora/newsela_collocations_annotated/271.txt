went
to
hide

heavenly
rock

so
the

was

and
the

the

devils

came
out

dark
world
and

the

took

turned
it
upside
down

began

looked

were
laughing

opened

cave
she
saw

wonderful
reflection

mirror

put

tree
and
slowly
came
out

at

the
god
closed
the

behind
her
so
she
could

god
tied
a

rope
across

entrance


the

goddess
was
then
asked
by

to
go
back
with

gods


she
agreed
and
light
came

was

viruses
do
not
appear
here
because
there
is
no
evidence
of
how
they
relate
to
the
other
three
kingdoms
of
life


an
organism
is
a
living
thing


it
is
easy
to
recognize
a
living
thing
but
not
so
easy
to
define
it


animals
and
plants
are
organisms
obviously


organisms
are
a
or
living
part
of
the
environment


rocks
and
sunshine
are
parts
of
the
environment


organisms
usually
have
five
basic
needs


they
need
air
water
nutrients
food
energy
and
a
place
to
live


however
not
all
living
things
need
all
these
at
the
same
time


many
organisms
do
not
need
access
to
air
at
all


a
little
thought
is
needed
about
viruses


there
is
no
agreement
as
to
whether
they
should
be
regarded
as
living


they
are
made
of
protein
and
<collocation>nucleic acid</collocation>
and
they
evolve
which
is
a
really
important
fact


however
they
exist
in
two
quite
different
phases


one
phase
is
dormant
not
active


the
other
is
inside
a
living
cell
of
some
other
organism


then
the
virus
is
very
active
reproducing
itself


consider
the
parallel
with
a
computer
program


when
in
use
it
is
active
when
it
is
not
it
is
completely
inactive


it
is
still
a
program
all
the
same


another
example
from
biology
is
the
spore
which
is
a
distribution
phase
of
a
bacteria
fungus
or
some
plants


they
are
not
active
until
they
get
to
the
right
situation


they
have
all
the
working
parts
to
build
a
complete
organism
but
for
the
moment
it
is
switched
off


some
organisms
are
made
up
of
millions
of
cells


they
are
<collocation>multicellular organisms</collocation>


many
can
be
seen
without
using
a
microscope


some
organisms
are
so
small
that
they
can
not
be
seen
with
the
naked
eye


you
need
a
microscope
to
see
them


they
are
called
microorganisms


organisms
can
be
made
up
of
just
one
cell


they
are
called
unicellular
organisms
or
single
organisms


examples
include
bacteria
and
protozoa

and

to
make

ships
which
were
about
metres

could
carry
tonnes

romans
made

ships
