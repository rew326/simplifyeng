an
insult
is
a
description
of
someone
that
will
offend
them


it
may
or
may
not
be
true


it
is
called
derogatory
language


terms
like
foolish
stupid
idiot
and
moron
are
insults
because
they
say
that
a
person
mind
is
not
quick
or
smart


<collocation>insulting someone</collocation>
mother
directly
is
a
serious
insult
in
many
cultures


ritual
insults
are
part
of
many
cultures


for
example
they
can
be
found
in
sports
and
military
training


they
are
also
very
common
in


for
example
the
word
newbie
is
a
part
of
net
jargon


calling
someone
a
newbie
is
usually
insulting


one
should
be
very
careful
when
using
new
words
to
describe
others


reason
usually
someone
insults
others
because
they
want
to
feel
like
they
are
better
or
have
more
power
influence
than
the
people
they
insult


they
may
want
this
because
they
are
actually
afraid
that
they
are
worse
or
less
powerful
than
the
people
they
are
insulting


effects
when
someone
is
insulted
his
or
her
pride
is
hurt


he
or
she
may
want
to
fight
back

the
immune
system
is
the
parts
of
the

which
work
against
infection
and
parasitism
by
other
living
things


deals
with
the
working
of
the
immune
system
in
health
and
diseases
and
with
malfunctions
of
the
immune
system


an
immune
system
is
present
in
all
plants
and
animals


we
know
this
because
biologists
have
found
genes
coding
for
receptors
in
many
different


these
receptors
can
recognize
bacteria
as
foreign
and
are
the
for
immune
reactions


the
type
of
immunity
which
is
triggered
by
the
receptors
is
called
<collocation>innate immunity</collocation>


this
is
because
it
is
entirely
inherited
in
our
genome
and
is
fully
working
as
soon
as
our
tissues
and
organs
are
properly
developed


vertebrates
and
only
vertebrates
have
a
second
type
of
immunity


this
is
called
adaptive
immunity
because
it
remembers
previous
infections


then
if
the
same
infection
occurs
again
the
reaction
is
much
stronger
and
faster


this
memory
confers
a
tremendous
<collocation>survival advantage</collocation>
and
with
it
vertebrates
can
survive
over
a
long
lifetime
in

system
the
<collocation>adaptive immune</collocation>

includes

that
do
require

exposure
to
a

it
explains
the
unique
ability
of
the
<collocation>mammalian immune</collocation>
system
to
remember
previous
infections
and
mount
a
rapid
and
<collocation>robust reaction</collocation>
to

this
memory
is
due
to
the
biology
of
and


other
aspects
of
immunity
vaccines
boost
the
acquired
immune
system
by
offering
weak
forms
of
infection
that
the
body
can
fight
off


the
system
remembers
how
to
do
it
again
when
a
stronger
infection
happens


if
the
vaccine
works
the
body
can
then
fight
off
a
serious
infection


the
distribution
of
vaccines
and
other
immune
system
affecting
cures
can
be
considered
another
level
of
acquired
immune
system
one
governed
by
access
to
vaccination
and
medicine
in
general


the
intersection
of
this
with

of
disease

studied
in
epidemiology

part

the
field

health


errors
and
weaknesses
errors
of
the
immune
system
may
cause
damage


in
autoimmune
diseases
the
body
attacks
parts
of
itself
because
the
system
mistakes
some
parts
of
the
body
as
foreign


some
kinds
of
arthritis
are
caused
this
way


sometimes
serious
pathogens
slip
in
because
their
surface
is
disguised
as
something
the
host
cell
walls
can
accept


that
is
how
viruses
work


once
inside
a
cell
their
genetic
material
controls
the
cell


infections
like
get
in
this
way
and
then
attack
cells
which
are
the
basis
of
the
immune
system


artificial
means
are
often
used
to
restore
immune
system
function
in
an
body
and
prevent
the
onset
of
aids


this
is
one
of
the
most
complex
issues
in
as
it
involves
every
level
of
that
system


this
research
during
the
and
radically
changed
the
view
of
the
human
immune
system
and
its
functions
and
integration
in
the
human
body


history
of
paul
studied
immune
systems
of
people


is
a
science
that
examines
the
structure
and
function
of
the
immune
system


it
originates
from
medicine
and
early
studies
on
the
causes
of
immunity
to
disease


the
earliest
known
mention
of
immunity
was
during
the
plague
of
athens
in


noted
that
people
who
had
recovered
from
a
<collocation>previous bout</collocation>
of
some
diseases
could
nurse
the
sick
without
contracting
the
illness
a
second
time


in
the
century
de
made
experiments
with
scorpion
venom
and
observed
that
certain
dogs
and
mice
were
immune
to
this
venom


this
and
other
observations
of
acquired
immunity
led
to
louis
pasteur
developing
vaccination
and
the
germ
theory
of
disease


pasteur
theory
was
in
direct
opposition
to
contemporary
theories
of
disease
such
as
the
<collocation>miasma theory</collocation>


it
was
not
until
the
proofs
robert
published
in
for
which
he
was
awarded
a
nobel
prize
in
that
microorganisms
were
confirmed
as
the
cause
of
infectious
disease


viruses
were
confirmed
as
human
pathogens
in
when
the
yellow
fever
virus
was
discovered

walter
reed
