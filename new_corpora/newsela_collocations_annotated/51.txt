for
this
reason
there
are
a
number
of
rules
about
the
correct
behavior
in
a
mosque


some
of
these
rules
are
the
same
all
over
the
world
such
as
no
shoes
should
be
worn
in
the
<collocation>prayer hall</collocation>


other
rules
are
different
from
mosque
to
mosque


prayer
leader
it
is
generally
seen
as
good
to
have
someone
who
leads
the
prayers
though
this
is
not
strictly
necessary


the
person
who
usually
leads
the
prayers
is
called
imam


he
must
be
a
free
and
honest
man


he
should
also
be
an
authority
when
it
comes
to
answering
questions
on
religion


in
mosques
that
were
built
or
that
are
kept
up
by
the
government
the
imam
is
selected
by
the
ruler


in
private
mosques
the
community
selects
the
imam
through
majority
voting


interior
of
the
a
former
mosque
with
columns
arranged
in
grid
pattern
in
spain


only
men
may
lead
prayers
for
men


women
are
allowed
to
lead
prayers
for
congregations
where
there
are
only
women


attending
a
mosque
in
addition
to
washing
there
are
other
rules
that
also
apply
to
those
who
enter
the
mosque
even
if
they
do
not
wish
to
pray
there


it
is
forbidden
to
wear
shoes
in
the
carpeted
area
of
the
<collocation>prayer hall</collocation>


some
mosques
also
do
not
allow
wearing
shoes
in
other
parts
even
though
these
may
not
be
devoted
to
praying


islam
requires
that
its
believers
wear
clothes
that
show
modesty


as
a
result
both
men
and
women
must
follow
this
rule
when
they
attend
a
mosque
though
mosques
may
not
always
enforce
the
rules


men
are
supposed
to
come
to
the
mosque
wearing
loose
and
clean
clothes
that
do
not
show
the
shape
of
the
body


similarly
women
who
come
to
the
mosque
are
expected
to
wear
loose
clothing
shirts
pants
that
cover
to
the
wrists
and
ankles
and
cover
their
heads
such
as
with
a


many
muslims
regardless
of
their
ethnic
background
wear
middle
eastern
clothing
associated
with
arabic
islam
to
special
occasions
and
prayers
at
mosques


mosques
are
places
of
worship


for
this
reason
those
inside
the
mosque
should
be
respectful
to
those
who
are
praying


loud
talking
or
discussion
of
topics
that
could
be
disrespectful
is
forbidden
in
areas
where
people
are
praying


it
is
also
considered
as
rude
to
walk
in
front
of
muslims
in
prayer
or
otherwise
disturb
them


men
and
women
pray
in
different
parts
muslims
praying
in
the
male
section
of
a
mosque
in
and
kashmir
india
islamic
law
requires
men
and
women
to
be
separated
in
the
<collocation>prayer hall</collocation>


ideally
women
should
pray
behind
men


muhammad
said
women
should
pray
at
home
not
at
the
mosque


muhammad
thought
women
should
not
be
forbidden
in
mosques


the
second
caliph
at
one
time
stopped
women
from
attending
mosques
especially
at
night
because
he
feared
they
may
be
teased
by
males
so
he
made
them
to
pray
at
home


sometimes
a
special
part
of
the
mosque
was
railed
off
for
women
for
example
the
governor
of
mecca
in
had
ropes
tied
between
the
columns
to
make
a
separate
place
for
women


many
mosques
today
will
put
the
women
behind
a
barrier
or
partition
or
in
another
room


mosques
in
south
and
<collocation>southeast asia</collocation>
put
men
and
women
in
separate
rooms
as
the
divisions
were
built
into
them
centuries
ago


in
nearly
of
american
mosques
women
pray
behind
partitions
or
in
separate
areas
not
in
the
main
<collocation>prayer hall</collocation>
some
mosques
do
not
admit
women
at
all


although
there
are
sections
only
for
women
and
children
the
grand
mosque
in
mecca
is
desegregated


in
mosques
a
few
scholars
of
islamic
law
believe
that
may
be
allowed
into
mosques
as
long
as
they
do
not
sleep
or
eat
there


followers
of
the
school
of
<collocation>islamic jurisprudence</collocation>
disagree


they
say
that
may
not
be
allowed
into
mosques
at
all


different
countries
have
different
opinions
on
the
question


nearly
all
the
mosques
in
the
<collocation>arabian peninsula</collocation>
as
well
as
morocco
do
not
allow


the
ii
mosque
in
casablanca
is
one
of
only
two
mosques
in
morocco
currently
open
to


in
<collocation>saudi arabia</collocation>
the
grand
mosque
and
all
of
mecca
are
open
only
to
muslims


likewise
the
and
the
city
of
medina
that
surrounds
it
are
also
to
those
who
do
not
practice
islam


for
mosques
in
other
areas
it
has
most
commonly
been
taken
that
may
only
enter
mosques
if
granted
permission
to
do
so
by
muslims
and
if
they
have
a
proper
reason


in
modern
turkey
tourists
are
allowed
to
enter
any
mosque
but
must
obey
the
rules
of
decorum


visiting
a
mosque
is
allowed
only
between
prayers
visitors
must
wear
long
trousers
and
take
off
their
shoes
women
must
cover
their
heads
no
photos
no
loud
talk
is
allowed


no
references
to
other
religions
are
allowed
no
crosses
on
necklaces
no
cross
gestures


however
there
are
also
many
other
places
in
the
west
as
well
as
the
islamic
world
where
are
welcome
to
enter
mosques


most
mosques
in
the
united
states
for
example
report
receiving
visitors
every
month


many
mosques
throughout
the
united
states
welcome
as
a
sign
of
openness
to
the
rest
of
the
community
and
to
encourage
conversions
to
islam


dogs
dogs
are
usually
banned
from
entering
mosques
but
on
september
the
muslim
law
council
made
special
ruling
called
a
fatwa
which
granted
a
blind
muslim
permission
to
take
his
guide
dog
into
the
mosque


mosques
as
hostels
it
is
common
for
a
smaller
mosque
to
serve
as
a
hostel
for
muslims
on
pilgrimage
to
mecca


sometimes
mosques
are
used
for
refugees
or
as
temporary
homes
for
homeless
people


obligations
to
neighbors
in
islam
are
very
strict
and
specific


in
the
an
mohammed
said
that
a
person
who
helps
others
in
the
hour
of
need
and
who
helps
the
oppressed
that
person
god
will
help
on
the
day
of
travail
agony


there
are
other
commands
such
as
helping
the
poor
and
being
nice
to
people


an
important
part
of
being
muslim
or
just
being
part
of
the
mosque
is
taking
care
of
people
who
need
help


a
mosque
is
a
social
as
well
as
a
religious
group


a
is
a
little
different
from
a
mosque


a
focuses
on
teaching
islam
usually
to
children
and
young
people


mosques
in
spain
the
de
was
a
mosque


today
it
is
the
cathedral
of
cordoba


when
spain
was
under
muslim
control
some
of
the
most
beautiful
buildings
were
mosques


after
spain
was
under
christian
control


however
the
christians
did
not
tear
down
the
mosques


they
simply
put
a
crucifix
in
them
to
make
them
into
churches


these
mosques
influenced
the
renaissance
architecture
way
of
building
in
europe

<collocation>reproductive cycle</collocation>
most
marsupial
and
mammals
have
a
<collocation>reproductive cycle</collocation>
known
as
the
cycle
cycle


females
are
sexually
active
only
during
the
stage
when
they
are
on
heat
for
a
few
days
each
month


if
an
ovum
is
not
the
endometrium
uterus
lining
is


cycles
may
occur
once
or
twice
a
year
or
many
times
a
year


each
group
of
mammals
has
its
own
frequency


humans
and
many
primates
are
quite
different


they
have
a
menstrual
cycle


in
this
case
females
are
sexually
receptive
at
any
time
but
only
fertile
when
an
ovum
is
released
from
an
ovary


in
this
case
the
endometrium
if
not
needed
for
an
egg
is
discarded


the
endometrium
is
shed
and
takes
with
it
a
certain
amount
of
blood


in
this
system
eggs
are
released
from
the
ovaries
mostly
in
the
middle
of
the
cycle
away
from
the
period


this
ovulation
is
concealed
meaning
it
is
not
obvious
when
it
occurs


this
process
so
it
is
thought
tends
to
keep
the
male
and
female
together
which
is
unusual
in
mammals
with
the
cycle


skeleton
one
<collocation>diagnostic feature</collocation>
is
the
<collocation>lower jaw</collocation>
which
unlike
earlier
forms
is
composed
of
a
single
bone
the


this
is
one
feature
which
can
be
seen
in
fossils
or
at
least
those
which
are
complete
enough
to
have
the
<collocation>lower jaw</collocation>


mammals
have
three
little
bones
in
their
<collocation>inner ear</collocation>
the
ear


the
ear
are
bones
which
were
<collocation>long ago</collocation>
part
of
the
<collocation>lower jaw</collocation>
in
early


there
are
quite
a
number
of
other
features
particularly
in
the
skull
and
limbs
so
that
it
is
usually
possible
identify
and
describe
a
mammal
from
its
skeleton
alone


neocortex
and
behavior
another
<collocation>diagnostic feature</collocation>
is
the
neocortex
of
the
brain
which
no
other
vertebrate
has


this
is
involved
in
the
kind
of
flexible
behavior
and
learning
typical
of
mammals


reptiles
and
birds
have
much
of
their
behavior
controlled
by
inherited
behavior
chains
which
roughly
translates
as
instincts


almost
all
animals
can
do
some
learning
but
mammals
do
far
more
than
other
vertebrates


their
behavior
is
much
more
flexible
than
lizards
for
example
and
that
is
made
possible
by
their
neocortex


other
things
in
the
life
of
mammals
seem
to
be
connected
with
this
flexibility
and
learning


play
is
a
kind
of
early
learning
period
in
which
according
to
one
theory
mammals
develop
skills
which
they
will
need
in
life


all
mammalian
young
play
and
this
is
very
obvious
in
the
more
intelligent
mammals
primates
cats


the
emotions
of
mammals
are
very
noticeable
and
rather
similar
to
ours


it
is
possible
and
quite
common
for
humans
to
have
a
friendly
relationship
with
another
mammal


it
is
quite
impossible
for
a
human
to
have
any
kind
of
relationship
with
a
snake
or
a
gecko
for
example


this
is
because
the
reptile
simply
does
not
have
the
same
basic
emotions
as
a
human


other
items
there
are
about
characters
which
are
typical
of
mammals
and
some
of
the
most
important
are
discussed
above


a
few
more
examples
will
make
it
clear
that
are
very
different
from
reptiles
and
birds

lies

body
but
in
mammals
it
lies
on
the
left
side


there
are
many
features
of
the
skeleton
that
mammals
share
their
neck
always
has
seven
vertebrae
no
matter
how
long
it
is


their
<collocation>lower jaw</collocation>
is
made
of
just
a
single
bone
on
each
side
the


their
<collocation>inner ear</collocation>
has
three
tiny
bones
the
malleus
incus
and
stapes


in
the
language
of
these
unique
characters
are
which
prove
that
mammals
are
a
descended
from
a
common
ancestor


main
groups
almost
all
mammals
give
birth
to
live
young


there
are
only
two
mammals
that
lay
eggs
called
the
platypus
and
the
spiny
anteater
echidna
with
four
species


all
are
confined
to
australia
and
new
guinea
and
are
the
<collocation>sole survivors</collocation>
of
an
earlier
group
of
mammals


however
like
other
mammals
they
feed
milk
to
their
young
and
protect
and
look
after
them


other
mammals
are
divided
into
the
marsupials
and
the
the
placental
mammals


marsupials
are
mammals
with
pouches
to
carry
young
in
like
the
kangaroo


all
other
mammals
are


modes
of
life
in
terms
of
number
of
species
mammals
with
species
are
not
the
most
successful
vertebrates


birds
with
about
species
have
nearly
twice
as
many
and
reptiles
have
just
as
many
as
birds


fish
have
even
more
species


there
are
species
of
fish
of
which
nearly
are
<collocation>bony fish</collocation>


despite
this
many
zoologists
do
regard
mammals
as
a
successful
group
of
animals


one
reason
is
that
they
are
successful
in
all
habitats
on
earth


in
the
air
in
the
water
in
forests
in
the
colder
regions
of
the
world
and
above
all
on
grasslands
where
they
are
outstandingly


in
the
air
the
bats
are
the
mammalian
order
with
the
most
species


they
own
the
nighttime
since
birds
are
largely
diurnal
daytime
animals


bats
are
hugely
successful
mostly
as
<collocation>nighttime predators</collocation>
of
insects


seagoing
mammals
the
and
the
are
very
successful
and
significant
predators


this
includes
the
whales
seals
walrus
dolphins
and
others


the
terrestrial
mammals
are
fewer
in
number
of
species
than
lizards
but
they
are
huge
in
individual
numbers
and
far
more
important
in
the
life
of
the
terrestrial


their
ability
to
move
from
place
to
place
and
adapt
has
made
them
a
most
effective
group


many
mammals
live
in
cold
places


these
mammals
have
thick
hair
or
blubber
to
keep
them
warm


others
may
live
in
rainforests


on
land
the
rodents
rats
mice
are
hugely
successful
more
common
in
numbers
than
any
other
mammals


large
mammals
on
land
have
been
hunted
to
extinction
in
some
parts
of
the
world
but
the
ones
which
remain
are
now
better
protected


last
but
certainly
not
least
are
the
primates


their
natural
habitat
with
few
exceptions
are
the
forests


most
live
in
the
trees
with
hands
that
grasp
good
color
vision
and
intelligence


in
the
pliocene
period
some
moved
out
onto
the
savannahs
as
grassland
replaced
forests


mankind
is
the
result
of
this
shift
into
the
savannahs


the
evolutionary

as

there
are
different
definitions

numbers
for
people
there
are
different
ways
of
giving
symbols
to
numbers


these
methods
are
called
number
systems


the
most
common
number
system
that
people
use
is
the
base
ten
number
system


the
base
ten
number
system
is
also
called
the
decimal
number
system


the
base
ten
number
system
is
common
because
people
have
ten
fingers
and
ten
toes


there
are
different
symbols
and
used
in
the
base
ten
number
system


these
ten
symbols
are
called
digits


a
symbol
for
a
number
is
made
up
of
these
ten
digits


the
position
of
the
digits
shows
how
big
the
number
is


for
example
the
number
in
the
decimal
number
system
really
means
times
plus
and
means
times
a
hundred
plus
times
plus
times


numbers
for
machine
another
number
system
is
more
common
for
machines


the
machine
number
system
is
called
the
binary
number
system


the
binary
number
system
is
also
called
the
base
two
number
system


there
are
two
different
symbols
and
used
in
the
base
two
number
system


these
two
symbols
are
called
bits


a
symbol
for
a
binary
number
is
made
up
of
these
two
bit
symbols


the
position
of
the
bit
symbols
shows
how
big
the
number
is


for
example
the
number
in
the
binary
number
system
really
means
times
plus
and
means
times
four
plus
times
two
plus
times


the
binary
number
is
the
same
as
the
decimal
number


the
binary
number
is
the
same
as
the
decimal
number


names
of
numbers
names
of
numbers
in
english
english
has
special
names
for
some
of
the
numbers
in
the
decimal
number
system
that
are
powers
of
ten


all
of
these
power
of
ten
numbers
in
the
decimal
number
system
use
just
the
symbol
and
the
symbol


for
example
ten
tens
is
the
same
as
ten
times
ten
or
one
hundred


in
symbols
this
is


also
ten
hundreds
is
the
same
as
ten
times
one
hundred
or
one
thousand


some
other
power
of
ten
numbers
also
have
special
names
one
ten
one
hundred
one
thousand
one
million
when
dealing
with
larger
numbers
than
this
there
are
two
different
ways
of
naming
the
numbers
in
english


under
the
long
scale
a
new
name
is
given
every
time
the
number
is
a
million
times
larger
than
the
last
named
number


it
is
also
called
the
british
standard


this
scale
used
to
be
common
in
britain
but
is
not
often
used
in
countries
today


it
is
still
used
in
some
other
european
nations


another
scale
is
the
short
scale
under
which
a
new
name
is
given
every
time
a
number
is
a
thousand
times
larger
than
the
last
named
number


this
scale
is
a
lot
more
common
in
most
nations
today


one

types
of
numbers
natural
numbers
natural
numbers
are
the
numbers
which
we
normally
use
for
counting


some
people
say
that
is
a
natural
number
too


another
name
for
these
numbers
is
positive
numbers


these
numbers
are
sometimes
written
as
to
show
that
they
are
different
from
the
negative
numbers


but
not
all
positive
numbers
are
natural
for
example
is
positive
but
not
natural
