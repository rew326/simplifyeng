the
big
changes
of
the
economy
industry
and
politics
of
the
country
began
in
the
early
days
of
soviet
power
in


a
large
part
of
this
was
performed
according
to
<collocation>bolshevik initial</collocation>
decrees
documents
of
the
soviet
government
signed
by
lenin


one
of
the
most
important
and
notable
breakthroughs
was
the
plan
that
planned
a
major
change
of
the
soviet
economy
based
on
total
electrification
of
the
country


the
plan
was
developed
in
and
covered
a
to
period


it
included
the
making
of
a
network
of
regional
power
stations
including
ten
large
hydroelectric
power
plants
and
numerous
large
<collocation>industrial organizations</collocation>


the
plan
became
the
prototype
for
subsequent
plans
and
was
basically
fulfilled
by


stalin
rule

years

based
on
the
rule

bolsheviks


after

<collocation>economic policy</collocation>
of

communism
during

the

government
permitted

to
coexist
with

in
the
countryside
was
replaced
by
a
food
tax

soviet
leaders
argued
that
rule
was
necessary
because
it
ensured
that
capitalist
exploitation
would
not
return
to
the
soviet
union
and
that
the
principles
of

would
represent

debate
over
the
future
of
the
economy
provided
the
background
for
soviet
leaders
to
contend
for
power
in

years
after

death

lenin
was
to
be
replaced
by
a
composed
of

originally

something

airport
in

an
airport
is
a
place
where
airplanes
can
land
or
take
off


most
airports
in
the
world
have
only
a
long
strip
of
level
ground
called
a
runway


many
airports
have
buildings
which
are
used
to
hold
airplanes
and
passengers


a
building
that
holds
passengers
waiting
for
their
planes
or
luggage
is
called
a
terminal


the
sections
between
the
plane
and
the
terminal
are
called
gates


airports
also
have
buildings
called
hangars
to
hold
planes
when
they
are
not
used


some
airports
have
buildings
to
control
the
airport
like
a
control
tower
which
tells
planes
where
to
go


an
international
airport
is
a
large
airport
that
airplanes
can
use
to
fly
to

a
domestic
airport
is
an
airport
which
is
usually
smaller
and
only
has
airplanes
coming
from
places
in
the
same
country


most
international
airports
have
shops

restaurants
for
airplane
passengers
to

an

is
often
called
an

an
<collocation>aircraft carrier</collocation>
is

safety
today
many
airports
think
that
safety
is
very
important


people
must
walk
through
a
metal
detector
a
machine
that
can
tell
if
metal
goes
through
it


if
it
makes
a
noise
the
officers
will
make
that
person
take
off
all
things
on
them
that
are
metal


they
also
have
machines
that
can
look
into
luggage


if
officers
find
items
such
as
weapons
guns
or
anything
that
can
be
used
to
kill
people
they
have
that
item
and
the
person
who
has
it
taken
away


as
well
as
this
passengers
are
not
allowed
to
bring
bottles
or
containers
with
over
ml
of
liquid
onto
the
plane
because
they
could
be
turned
into
bombs


therefore
all
water
bottles
must
be
emptied
before
entering
the

other
liquids

could
be
called

they

the
name
would
always

ice
for

instead
of
just

water
becomes
ice
when
it
is
very
cold


liquid
water
freezes
and
becomes
solid
ice
at
a
temperature
of
celsius
fahrenheit
or
kelvin


ice
is
commonly
made
in
a
home
refrigerator
or
freezer


if
water
is
put
in
a
freezer
and
left
for
a
while
the
water
gets
very
cold
and
will
freeze
solid
creating
ice


water
can
be
placed
into
a
copper
or
other
meta
container
to
cause
it

metals

how
ice
is
formed
unlike
other
liquids
water
expands
as
it
freezes
to
become
ice
so
ice
floats
on
water
because
ice
has
less
density
than
water


this
is
very
unusual
just
about
every
other
liquid
gets
more
dense
as
it
cools
water
ice
however
is
an
important
exception


liquid
water
expands
by
about
as
it
becomes
ice
it
takes
up
more
space


if
water
in
pipes
freezes
it
can
burst
the
pipe


water
in
glass
bottles
can
explode
in
the
freezer
if
people
leave
it
there
long
enough
to
freeze


water
freezing
in
rock
cracks
can
expand
enough
to
split
hard
rocks
apart
this
is
an
important
geological
weathering
process
that
can
wear
down
mountains
and
make
rock
into
soil


when
materials
are
cooled
their
molecules
vibrate
less
and
compact
together


when
most
materials
reach
a
temperature
called
the
freezing
point
the
molecules
form
a
<collocation>crystalline solid</collocation>
although
some
materials
like
glass
and
tar
do
not
at
all
but
form
super
stiff
fluids
which
seem
to
be
solid


only
helium
will
not
freeze
all
other
substances
will
freeze
if
cold
enough
but
fluids
like
cooking
oil
petrol
gasoline
nitrogen
freeze
at
temperatures
that
most
people
do
experience


salt
water
salt
water
needs
a
lower
temperature
to
freeze
than
pure
water


the
resulting
ice
contains
much
less
salt
than
the
salt
water
it
came
from


this
salty
ice
is
not
as
strong
as
frozen
pure
water


similarly
spreading
salt
on
ice
melts
it
if
it
not
too
cold
the
salt
progressively
eats
into
the
ice
forming
brine
which
is
not
cold
enough
to
be
frozen
at
the
same
temperature


geographical
locations
of
ice
because
ice
floats
even
large
bodies
of
water
that
freeze
like
some
oceans
only
form
ice
on
the
surface


most
lakes
never
freeze
to
the
bottom


even
the
<collocation>coldest oceans</collocation>
like
the
arctic
ocean
only
freeze
on
the
top
leaving
liquid
ocean
circulating
below


because
of
this
the
earth
oceans
are

<collocation>less extremes</collocation>
of

than
it

otherwise


if
ice
were
to
sink
instead

float
the
oceans
would
fill
up
with
ice
from
the
bottom
would
remain
solid
and
only
some

a

ocean
would
not
circulate
heat


but
because
ice
floats
on
the
surface
the
water
beneath
can
continue
to
circulate
and
the
ice
on
the
surface
stays
exposed
and
readily
melts
when
the
temperature
rises

the

during

very

the

people
liked
to
use
an

called
unix


but
because
it
restricted
the

the

some
people
made
a
new
operating
system
that
would
work
like
unix
but
which
anybody
could
share
or
improve


similar
to
unix
was
used
as
a
teaching
tool
for

students
to
learn
how

restricted
