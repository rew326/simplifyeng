physicists
often
use
the
letter
c
to
denote
the
speed
of
light


it
has
the
value
meters
per
second
or
about
miles
per
second


a
photon
particle
of
light
travels
at
this
speed
in
a
vacuum


according
to
special
relativity
c
is
the
maximum
speed
at
which
all
energy
matter
and
physical
information
in
the
universe
can
travel


it
is
the
speed
of
all
<collocation>massless particles</collocation>
such
as
photons
and
associated
fields
including
electromagnetic
radiation
such
as
light
in
a
vacuum


neutrinos
also
travel
at
the
speed
of
light


it
is
predicted
by
the
current
theory
to
be
the
speed
of
gravity
that
is
<collocation>gravitational waves</collocation>


such
particles
and
waves
travel
at
c
regardless
of
the
motion
of
the
source
or
the
inertial
frame
of
reference
of
the
observer


in
the
theory
of
relativity
c
space
and
time
and
appears
in
the
famous
equation
of
mass
energy
e
mc


the
theory
of
relativity
is
based
on
the
prediction
so
far
upheld
by
observations
that
the
measured
speed
of
light
in
a
vacuum
is
the
same
whether
or
not
the
source
of
the
light
and
the
person
doing
the
measuring
are
moving
relative
to
each
other


this
is
sometimes
expressed
as
the
speed
of
light
is
independent
of
the
reference
frame

example
this
behavior
is
different
from
our
common
ideas
about
motion
as
shown
by
this
example
george
is
standing
on
the
ground
next
to
some
train
tracks


there
is
a
train
rushing
by
at
mph


george
throws
a
baseball
at
mph
in
the
direction
the
train
is
moving


tom
a
passenger
on
the
train
has
a
device
like
a
radar
gun
to
measure
throwing
speeds


because
he
is
on
the
train
tom
is
already
moving
at
mph
in
the
direction
of
the
throw
so
tom
measures
the
speed
of
the
ball
as
only
mph


in
other
words
the
speed
of
the
baseball
as
measured
by
tom
on
the
train
depends
on
the
speed
of
the
train


in
the
example
above
the
train
was
moving
at
the
speed
of
the
ball
and
the
speed
of
the
ball
as
measured
on
the
train
was
of
the
throwing
speed
as
measured
on
the
ground


now
repeat
the
experiment
with
light
instead
of
a
baseball
that
is
george
has
a
flashlight
instead
of
throwing
a
baseball


george
and
tom
both
have
devices
that
are
the
same
to
measure
the
speed
of
light
instead
of
the
radar
gun
in
the
baseball
example


george
is
standing
on
the
ground
next
to
some
train
tracks


there
is
a
train
rushing
by
at
the
speed
of
light


george
flashes
a
light
beam
in
the
direction
the
train
is
moving


george
measures
the
speed
of
light
as
miles
per
second


tom
a
passenger
on
the
train
measures
the
speed
of
the
light
beam


what
speed
does
tom
measure


intuitively
you
may
think
that
the
speed
of
the
light
from
the
flashlight
as
measured
on
the
train
should
be
the
speed
measured
on
the
ground
just
like
the
speed
of
the
baseball
was


but
in
fact
the
speed
measured
on
the
train
is
the
full
value
mile
per
second
not
miles
per
second


it
sounds
impossible
but
that
what
one
measures


part
of
the
reason
is
that
light
is
energy
which
acts
and
moves
in
ways
very
different
than
matter
or
solid
objects
such
as
a
baseball


maxwell
equations
predicted
the
speed
of
light
and
confirmed
michael
faraday
idea
that
light
was
an
electromagnetic
wave
a
way
that
energy
moves


from
these
equations
we
find
that
the
speed
of
light
is
related
to
the
inverse
of
the
square
root
of
the
permittivity
of
free
space
and
the
permeability
of
free
space


a
consequence
of
this
fact
is
that
nothing
can
go
faster
than
the
speed
of
light


another
consequence
is
that
for
objects
that
have
mass
no
matter
how
much
energy
is
used
to
increase
the
speed
of
an
object
it
will
get
closer
and
closer
but
it
will
never
reach
the
speed
of
light


these
ideas
were
discovered
in
the
early
by
albert
einstein
whose
work
completely
changed
our
understanding
of
light


the
index
of
refraction
of
a
clear
material
is
the
ratio
between
the
speed
of
light
in
a
vacuum
and
the
speed
of
light
in
that
material


measurement
ole
used
an
astronomical
measurement
to
make
the
first
<collocation>quantitative estimate</collocation>
of
the
speed
of
light


when
measured
from
earth
the
periods
of
moons
orbiting
a
distant
planet
are
shorter
when
the
earth
is
approaching
the
planet
than
when
the
earth
is
receding
from
it


the
distance
traveled
by
light
from
the
planet
or
its
moon
to
earth
is
shorter
when
the
earth
is
at
the
point
in
its
orbit
that
is
closest
to
its
planet
than
when
the
earth
is
at
the
farthest
point
in
its
orbit
the
difference
in
distance
being
the
diameter
of
the
earth
orbit
around
the
sun


the
observed
change
in
the
moon
orbital
period
is
actually
the
difference
in
the
time
it
takes
light
to
traverse
the
shorter
or
longer
distance


observed
this
effect
for
jupiter
innermost
moon
io
and
deduced
that
light
takes
minutes
to
cross
the
diameter
of
the
earth
orbit


aberration
of
light
light
from
a
distant
source
appears
to
be
from
a
different
location
for
a
moving
telescope
due
to
the
finite
speed
of
light


another
method
is
to
use
the
aberration
of
light
discovered
and
explained
by
james
in
the
century


this
effect
results
from
the
vector
addition
of
the
velocity
of
light
arriving
from
a
distant
source
such
as
a
star
and
the
velocity
of
its
observer
see
diagram
on
the
right


a
moving
observer
thus
sees
the
light
coming
from
a
slightly
different
direction
and
consequently
sees
the
source
at
a
position
shifted
from
its
original
position


since
the
direction
of
the
earth
velocity
changes
continuously
as
the
earth
orbits
the
sun
this
effect
causes
the
apparent
position
of
stars
to
move
around


from
the
angular
difference
in
the
position
of
stars
it
is
possible
to
express
the
speed
of
light
in
terms
of
the
earth
velocity
around
the
sun


this
with
the
known
length
of
a
year
can
be
easily
converted
to
the
time
needed
to
travel
from
the
sun
to
the
earth


in
used
this
method
to
derive
that
light
traveled
times
faster
than
the
earth
in
its
orbit
the
modern
figure
is
times
faster
or
that
it
would
take
light
minutes
seconds
to
travel
from
the
sun
to
the
earth


modern
nowadays
the
light
time
for
unit
distance
the
inverse
of
c
expressed
in
seconds
per
astronomical
unit
is
measured
by
comparing
the
time
for
radio
signals
to
reach
different
spacecraft
in
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>


the
position
of
spacecraft
is
calculated
from
the
gravitational
effects
of
the
sun
and
various
planets


by
combining
many
such
measurements
a
best
fit
value
for
the
light
time
per
unit
distance
is
obtained


as
of
the
best
estimate
as
approved
by
the
international
astronomical
union
is

the
<collocation>relative uncertainty</collocation>
in
these
measurements
is
parts
per
billion
e
equivalent
to
the
uncertainty
in
measurements
of
length
by
interferometry


since
the
metre
is
defined
to
be
the
length
traveled
by
light
in
a
certain
time
interval
the
measurement
of
the
light
time
for
unit
distance
can
also
be
interpreted
as
measuring
the
length
of
an
in
metres


the
metre
is
considered
to
be
a
unit
of
proper
length
whereas
the
is
usually
used
as
a
unit
of
observed
length
in
a
given
frame
of
reference


practical
effects
the
finite
speed
of
light
is
a
major
constraint
on
space
travel


supposing
a
journey
to
the
other
side
of
the
milky
way
the
total
time
for
a
message
and
its
reply
would
be
about
years


even
more
seriously
no
spacecraft
could
travel
faster
than
light
so
all
transport
would
be
effectively
and
would
take
much
longer
than
than
any
modern
civilisation
has
existed


the
speed
of
light
can
also
be
of
concern
over
very
short
distances


in
supercomputers
the
speed
of
light
imposes
a
limit
on
how
quickly
data
can
be
sent
between
processors


if
a
processor
operates
at
gigahertz
a
signal
can
only
travel
a
maximum
of
about
convert
cm
ft
in
a
single
cycle


processors
must
therefore
be
placed
close
to
each
other
to
minimize
communication
this
can
cause
difficulty
with
cooling


if
clock
frequencies
continue
to
increase
the
speed
of
light
will
eventually
become
a
limiting
factor
for
the
internal
design
of
single
chips

denial
is
a
word
used
in
psychology


it
means
that
someone
denies
that
something
has
happened
or
is
happening
although
he
really
knows
it
is
true


usually
this
happens
because
admitting
it
would
cause
a
lot
of
pain


denial
is
usually
the
first
state
of
coping
with
loss


for
example
if
someone
close
to
a
person
dies
the
survivor
first
feeling
might
be
denial
or
refusal
to
accept
the
fact
that
the
person
is
really
dead


denial
is
also
when
you
think
that
a
team
like
in
football
will
win
a
football
match
before
its
even
started
and
refuse
to
accept
the
fact
they
could
lose
denial
is
also
when
you
refuse
to
accept
the
fact
that
someone
else
did
something
like
change
something
when
you
think
you
know
it
was
a
different
person
