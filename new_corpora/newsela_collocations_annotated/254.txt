to
get
elected

life

mary
margaret
truman


in
november
harry
truman
lost


he
was
elected
county
judge
again
in


county
judge
was
not
a
judicial
office


it
was
more
like
the
california
office
of
<collocation>county supervisor</collocation>
in
he
was
elected
senator
of
missouri


harry
became
a
member
of
the
interstate
commerce
committee


he
was
of
a
subcommittee
on
railroad
safety


in
harry
truman
ran
for
to
the
senate


governor
stark
was
his
primary
opponent


president
franklin
roosevelt
wanted
stark
to
win


louis
mayor
bernard
wanted
stark
to
win


harry
had
a
hard
time
getting
money


most
people
thought
that
harry
would
lose


about
a
month
before
the
primary
election
the
railroad
unions
said
that
they
wanted
truman
to
win


two
days
before
primary
election
day
bernard
also
said
that
he
wanted
harry
to
win
instead
of
stark


harry
won
by
about
votes


he
also
won
the
election
in
november


truman
became
chairman
of
a
committee
to
investigate
defense
spending
during
<collocation>world war</collocation>


he
helped
eliminate
billions
of
dollars
of
spending
in
the
defense
department
that
he
believed
was
a
waste


he
supported
roosevelt
leadership
of
the
country
in
the
war
but
wanted
to
make
the
government
more
efficient
and
effective


he
gained
a
moderate
amount
of
fame
for
leading
that
committee


in
president
franklin
roosevelt
ran
for
again


roosevelt
was
in
bad
health
and
he
did
not
have
much
longer
to
live


the
democratic
party
realized
that
whoever
they
selected
as
vice
president
could
potentially
be
the
next
president
of
the
united
states


george
roosevelt
former
vice
president
was
not
selected
because
he
had
a
<collocation>friendly attitude</collocation>
toward
the
soviet
union
which
many
saw
as
a
dictatorship


roosevelt
wanted
truman
as
his
vice
president
and
truman
was
selected
as
his
vice
president


they
won
the
election
and
roosevelt
began
his
term
as
president


on
april
shortly
after
the
election
franklin
roosevelt
died
and
harry
truman
became
president


presidency
after
franklin
roosevelt
died
truman
became
president


truman
said
it
felt
like
the
moon
the
stars
and
all
of
the
planets
had
fallen
upon
me


harry
truman
became
president
during
the
last
few
months
of
<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii


while
truman
was
vice
president
he
was
never
told
much
about
<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii
by
roosevelt
because
back
then
the
vice
presidency
was
not
thought
to
be
an
important
political
position


truman
entered
the
presidency
knowing
not
much
more
about
military
operations
in
<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii
than
the
average
person


however
truman
<collocation>defense advisors</collocation>
told
him
everything
once
he
became
president


the
united
states
made
the
declaration
telling
japan
to
surrender
the
war
or
it
will
face
prompt
and
utter
destruction


japan
did
not
surrender


in
result
truman
authorized
the
dropping
of
the
first
atomic
bomb
on
japan
in
the
city
hiroshima
on
august


truman
ordered
the
second
atomic
bomb
to
be
dropped
on
the
japanese
city
nagasaki
on
august


japan
surrendered
and
the
war
ended


the
bombs
were
very
destructive


they
destroyed
both
cities
and
killed
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people


for
that
reason
the
decision
to
use
the
weapons
was
controversial
meaning
that
many
people
supported
it
but
many
people
were
against
it
also


people
who
were
against
it
such
as
general
and
future
president
dwight
eisenhower
believe
it
was
a
cruel
and
<collocation>inhumane attack</collocation>
on
innocent
people
when
japan
was
already
close
to
being
defeated


people
who
supported
the
decision
felt
it
was
necessary
because
it
ended
the
war
early


truman
felt
that
if
the
had
invaded
japan
instead
of
using
the
bombs
to
end
the
war
quickly
much
more
people
would
have
died


after
the
war
truman
ordered
europe
which
was
destroyed
during
the
war
to
be
repaired
with
the
marshall
plan


germany
was
divided
into
two
parts
after
the
war


the
soviet
union
controlled
east
germany


the
united
states
britain
and
france
controlled
west
germany


truman
ordered
the
<collocation>berlin airlift</collocation>
which
flew
in
tons
of
food
to
west
germany
to
feed
the
starving
people


he
helped
create
the
united
nations
an
organization
which
was
based
on
the
league
of
nations


the
united
nations
which
still
exists
today
was
founded
on
the
purpose
of
developed
nations
working
together
to
help
humanity
and
to
promote
peace


after
<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii
the
soviet
union
and
the
united
states
were
the
only
two
powerful
countries
left


with
germany
being
divided
between
the
soviet
union
and
the
united
states
tensions
began
to
increase
between
the
two
countries


the
cold
war
began


this
was
a
war
where
the
soviet
union
and
the
united
states
did
not
fight
directly
but
each
wanted
to
have
a
bigger
influence
than
the
other
over
the
world


the
soviet
union
wanted
to
spread
communism
a
belief
that
the
government
should
own
the
economy
to
make
everybody
equal
around
the
world


truman
believed
in
a
policy
called
containment
which
was
devised
by
one
of
his
<collocation>defense advisors</collocation>
that
the
should
contain
communism
and
stop
it
from
spreading


truman
declared
the
<collocation>truman doctrine</collocation>
which
was
the
belief
that
the
united
states
should
give
money
to
turkey
and
greece
so
that
they
could
be
strong
enough
to
defend
themselves
from
communism


he
sent
congress
his
<collocation>fair deal</collocation>


it
was
based
on
roosevelt
new
deal


it
included
more
money
to
education
more
money
to
farmers
and
a
higher
minimum
wage
for
workers


labor
union
leaders
asked
him
for
higher
wages
and
more
benefits


after
the
coal
miners
strike
he
had
the
department
of
interior
take
over
the
mines


while
truman
sympathized
for
the
working
class
when
there
was
a
huge
railroad
strike
truman
believed
it
was
illegal
and
unfair
to
people
who
could
not
get
to
work
because
the
railroads
were
not
operating
so
he
threatened
to
draft
the
people
into
the
army
if
they
did
not
return
to
work


he
also
desegregated
the
military
allowing
blacks
and
whites
to
fight
together


in
harry
truman
ran
for
a
second
term
as
president
against
thomas


he
was
the
underdog
and
everyone
thought
he
was
going
to
lose


the
<collocation>chicago tribune</collocation>
published
a
newspaper
on
the
night
of
the
election
with
the
title
defeats
truman


to
everyone
surprise
harry
truman
won
the
election


on
june
north
korea
attacked
south
korea


china
was
on
the
side
of
north
korea


north
korea
wanted
to
bring
communism
into
south
korea


the
fought
the
korean
war
to
defend
south
korea
and
it
eventually
ended
shortly
after
truman
term
ended


general
douglas
wanted
to
bomb
china
but
truman
thought
it
was
too
dangerous
to
do
that
so
he
fired
him


many
people
respected
so
they
were
angry
at
truman


he
made
ridgeway
general


during
the
end
of
his
term
harry
truman
approval
rating
was
at
an
low


he
was
very
unpopular
because
thousands
of
americans
died
in
the
korean
war
there
was
a
moderate
amount
of
corruption
in
his
government
and
people
were
accusing
many
of
truman
employees
of
being
communists


he
left
office
on
january


as
time
passed
his
reputation
improved


many
historians
now
believe
that
harry
truman
was
a
great
president


later
life
harry
truman
moved
back
to
missouri


he
died
on
december

early
years
adams
was
born
in
massachusetts


he
went
to
harvard
college


he
married
abigail
adams
in


revolution
years
adams
wanted
the
thirteen
colonies
to
be
free
from
great
britain


however
adams
was
fair
and
thought
every
person
should
be
treated
fairly


even
though
he
did
not
want
british
soldiers
in
boston
he
was
the
lawyer
who
defended
the
british
soldiers
who
were
involved
in
the
boston
massacre


adams
was
a
representative
from
massachusetts
during
the
second
<collocation>continental congress</collocation>


he
helped
thomas
jefferson
write
the
united
states
declaration
of
independence


during
the
american
revolutionary
war
adams
helped
make
peace
with
great
britain


he
served
in
france
the
netherlands
and
england
as
an
ambassador
in
the


vice
president
adams
was
the
first
vice
president
under
george
washington


after
washington
chose
not
to
run
again
adams
won
the
election


adams
is
thought
to
have
been
the
first
president
to
belong
to
a
political
party
but
like
george
washington
he
thought
himself
above
any
particular
party


he
ran
for
president
on
the
ticket


he
beat
thomas
jefferson
of
the
party


president
candidates
and
vice
president
candidates
did
not
run
together
like
they
do
today


since
jefferson
got
the
second
highest
number
of
votes
he
became
vice
president


president
during
his
term
he
resolved
a
conflict
against
france
peacefully


he
also
passed
the
alien
and
sedition
acts
which
made
it
illegal
to
say
bad
things
about
the
government


many
people
did
not
like
those
acts
because
they
felt
it
took
away
their
freedom
of
speech


adams
was
not
president
and
lost
to
thomas
jefferson


the
party
was
not
as
popular
as
it
was
when
adams
was
elected


one
of
his
last
acts
as
president
was
to
make
john
marshall
the
<collocation>chief justice</collocation>
of
the
united
states


this
made
sure
that
the
party
would
still
be
important


of
the
first
five
presidents
adams
was
the
only
one
who
did
not
own
slaves


he
was
also
the
only
one
to
be
from
new
england


death
adams
died
on
july


this
was
the
same
day
that
thomas
jefferson
died
and
was
also
exactly
years
after
the
declaration
of
independence
was
signed
in
