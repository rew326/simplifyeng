people
probably

by
planting
a

but
still
gathered

foods
from

people
may
have
started
farming
because
the
weather

began

<collocation>overview agriculture</collocation>

not

many
people
live
by
doing
what
is
called
subsistence
agriculture
on
a
small
farm


only
the
farmer
family
lives
on
the
farm


subsistence
agriculture
is
growing
only
enough
food
to
feed
the
farmer
his
family
and
his
animals


extra
food
or
animals
are
sold
for
money
or
other
things
the
farmer
can
not
grow


the
yield
is
the
amount
of
food
grown
on
a
given
amount
of
land
and
the
yield
is
often
low


this
is
because
<collocation>subsistence farmers</collocation>
are
generally
less
educated
and
they
have
less
money
to
buy
equipment


when
yields
are
low
forests
are
sometimes
cut
to
provide
new
land
to
grow
more
food


this
is
good
in
the
short
term
but
can
be
bad
for
the
country
and
the
surrounding
environment
over
many
years


in
rich
countries
farms
are
often
much
larger


the
yield
on
farms
has
gotten
bigger
in
the
last
one
<collocation>hundred years</collocation>
because
farmers
are
able
to
grow
better
varieties
of
plants
use
more
fertilizer
use
more
water
and
more
easily
control
weeds
and
pests


many
farms
also
use
machines
which
cut
down
on
the
number
of
people
needed
to
farm
the
land


this
results
in
fewer
farmers
in
rich
countries
but
the
farmers
are
able
to
eat
more


this
kind
of
<collocation>intensive agriculture</collocation>
comes
with
its
own
set
of
problems


farmers
use
a
lot
of
chemical
fertilizers
pesticides
chemicals
that
kill
bugs
and
herbicides
chemicals
that
kill
weeds


these
chemicals
can
pollute
the
soil
or
the
water


they
can
also
create
bugs
and
weeds
that
are
more
resistant
to
the
chemicals
causing
outbreaks
of
these
pests


the
soil
can
be
damaged
by
erosion
blowing
or
washing
away
<collocation>salt buildup</collocation>
or
loss
of
structure


irrigation
adding
water
from
rivers
can
pollute
water
and
lower
the
water
table


having
fewer
farmers
also
changes
society
and
can
make
a
country
less
able
to
feed
itself
in
bad
times

have

try
to

because
it

people
say
<collocation>intensive agriculture</collocation>
is
damaging

for
this
reason
there
are
several
types
of
agriculture


traditional
agriculture
is

in
poor
countries

done
in

it
uses

organic
farming
is

integrated

arithmetic
is
a
name
for
working
with
numbers


it
is
a
part
of
mathematics


the
four
basic
arithmetic
operations
are
addition
subtraction
multiplication
and
division


harder
arithmetic
includes
working
with
signed
numbers
fractions
and
decimals
and
taking
powers
and
roots


most
people
learn
arithmetic
in
primary
school
but
some
people
do
not
learn
arithmetic
and
others
forget
the
arithmetic
they
learned


many
jobs
require
a
knowledge
of
arithmetic
and
many
employers
complain
that
it
is
hard
to
find
people
who
know
enough
arithmetic


a
few
of
the
many
jobs
that
require
arithmetic
include
carpenters
plumbers
auto
mechanics
accountants
architects
doctors
and
nurses


arithmetic
is
needed
in
all
areas
of
mathematics
science
and
engineering


a
calculator
can
be
used
to
do
arithmetic

another
way
to

is

an

did
not
own
the
land
in
that
way


they
belonged
to
the
land
like
a
baby
belongs
to
its
mother


captain
cook
went
home
to
england
and
told
the
government
that
owned
the
land


this
would
later
cause
a
terrible
problem
for
the
aboriginal
people


settlement

in


in
the
in
england
laws
were
tough
many
people
were
poor
and
jails
were
full


a
person
could
be
sentenced
to
death
for
stealing
a
loaf
of
bread


many
people
were
hanged
for
small
crimes


but
usually
they
were
just
thrown
in
gaol


often
they
were
sent
away
to
the
british
colonies
in
america


but
in
the
the
colonies
in
america
became
the
united
states


they
were
free
from
british
rule
and
would
not
take
england
convicts
any
more


by
the
the
of
england
were
so
full
that
convicts
were
often
chained
up
in
rotting
old
ships


the
government
decided
to
make
a
settlement
in
new
south
wales
and
send
some
of
the
convicts
there


in
the
first
fleet
of
eleven
ships
set
sail
from
carrying
convicts
sailors
marines
a
few
free
settlers
and
enough
food
to
last
for
two
years


their
leader
was
captain
arthur


they
were
to
make
a
new
colony
at
the
place
that
captain
cook
had
discovered
named
<collocation>botany bay</collocation>
because
of
all
the
unknown
plants
found
there
by
the
two
scientists


captain
found
that
<collocation>botany bay</collocation>
was
flat
and
windy


there
was
not
much
fresh
water


he
went
with
two
ships
up
the
coast
and
sailed
into
a
great
harbor
which
he
said
was
the
<collocation>finest harbor</collocation>
in
the
world


there
were
many
small
bays
on
the
harbor
so
he
decided
on
one
which
had
a
good
stream
of
fresh
water
and
some
flat
shore
to
land
on


on
the
january
the
flag
was
raised
and
new
south
wales
was
claimed
in
the
name
of
king
george
iii
of
england
and
the
new
settlement
was
called
sydney


for
the
first
few
years
of
the
settlement
things
were
very
difficult


in
the
british
government
had
thought
very
hard
about
what
sort
of
convicts
should
be
sent
to
make
a
new
colony


nobody
had
chosen
them
carefully


there
was
only
one
man
who
was
a
farmer


there
was
among
the
convicts
who
was
a
builder
a
or
a
blacksmith


knew
how
to
fix
the
tools
when
they
broke


the
cattle
all
escaped


there
were
no
cooking
pots


all
the
plants
were
different
so
knew
which
ones
could
be
eaten


there
was
a
<collocation>grave danger</collocation>
that
everyone
in
the
new
colony
would
die
of
starvation


somehow
the
little
group
of
tents
with
a
hut
for
the
governor
arthur
and
another
hut
for
the
supply
of
food
grew
into
a
small
town
with
streets
a
bridge
over
the
stream
a
windmill
for
grinding
grain
and
wharves
for
ships


by
the
there
was
a
fine
brick
house
for
the
governor
