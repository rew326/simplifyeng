general
information
the
spanish
language
is
used
by
many
people
in
the
world
today


this
is
partly
because
the
people
of
spain
traveled
to
and
colonized
many
different
parts
of
the
world


they
created
many
new
countries
and
also
new
governments
in
some
old
countries


the
countries
that
have
spanish
as
an
official
language
are
called
the
hispanic
countries


most
of
them
are
in
the
americas
which
make
up
latin
america


some
examples
of
places
where
spanish
is
an
important
language
are
in
north
america
central
america
and
the
caribbean
islands
costa
cuba
the
dominican
republic
guatemala
honduras
mexico
nicaragua
panama
puerto
<collocation>el salvador</collocation>
in
the
united
states
and
most
people
use
the

language

is
the

the

learn
spanish
as

fact

february


in
other
parts
of
the
world
the
philippines

guinea


the
spanish
language
has
originally
been
the
language
of
castile


when
the
western
roman
empire
collapsed
the
latin
language
began
to
develop
in
different
ways
in
different
provinces


the
latin
spoken
in
peninsula
developed
first
into
language
in
the
century


castilian
and
portuguese
became
separate
languages
in
the
century


in
spain
there
are
other
languages
that
also
came
from
latin
that
are
connected
to
spanish
like
basque
catalan
and


catalan
language
is
not
a
dialect
of
spanish
but
more
closely
related
to
french
language


portuguese
which
is
spoken
in
portugal
and
brazil
has
a
very
close
relation
with
spanish


basque
is
also
spoken
but
it
is
not
related
to
spanish


therefore
the
spanish
language
is
sometimes
called
castilian
named
after
castile
a
region
in
spain
where
the
language
came
from


many
people
defend
that
the
most
correct
name
for
the
language
is
castilian
because
before
the
existence
of
spain
as
a
country
the
language
already
existed
while
others
say
it
is
better
to
call
it
spanish
they
say
that
castilian
is
the
accent
of
spaniards
though
spain
is
a
small
country
and
it
has
very
varied
accents


the
spanish
word
for
spanish
is
and
the
spanish
word
for
castilian
is
castellano


in
the
other
romance
languages
spoken
on
the
peninsula
such
as
catalan
and
others
the
designation
is
and
the
word
spanish
is
rarely
used
to
refer
the
language


in
spain
the
name
of
the
subject
in
schools
is
castilian
language


in
zones
of
spain
people
can
say
spanish
to
refer
to
their
language


in
portuguese
it
common
to
use
the
word
when
talking
about
this
language
too


statistics
in
for
the
first
time
in
history
the
spanish
was
the
first
<collocation>mother tongue</collocation>
language
of
the
western
world
bypassing

earth
spanish
is
spoken
by
million
people
in
the
world
as
their
first
language
while
english
is
only
million


this
is
because
