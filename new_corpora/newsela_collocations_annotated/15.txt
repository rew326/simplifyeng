cartography
is
part
of
geography


how
people
make
maps
is
always
changing


in
the
past
maps
were
drawn
by
hand
but
today
most
printed
maps
are
made
using
computers


someone
who
makes
maps
is
called
a
cartographer


making
a
map
can
be
as
simple
as
drawing
a
direction
on
a
napkin
or
as
complicated
as
showing
a
census
of
a
whole
country


anyone
can
make
a
map
but
there
are
people
who
spend
their
lives
learning
how
to
make
complicated
maps


a
creator
is
a
person
who
creates
something


in
some
religions
judaism
christianity
islam
god
or
allah
meaning
the
god
in
arabic
is
the
most
important
and
original
creator
of
the
whole
universe
including
man
who
is
made
in
his
image
see
genesis
to
observe
it
and
control
it
like
god


the
idea
that
anything
that
a
person
is
creating
like
an
idea
can
be
owned
as
property
comes
from
the
<collocation>ethical traditions</collocation>
and
legal
codes
that
came
from
these
religions


in
other
traditions
buddhism
native
american
mythology
anyone
has
this
potential
for
creating
and
can
become
part
of

chorizo
is
a
pork
sausage
which
people
first
made
in
the
peninsula


it
is
made
with
large
pieces
of
fatty
pork
<collocation>chili pepper</collocation>
and
paprika


the
special
taste
of
this
sausage
comes
from
the
mild
spanish
paprika
in
it


in
the
western
hemisphere
the
mexican
and
caribbean
types
are
better
known


these
types
of
chorizo
are
made
with
smaller
pieces
of
pork
and
different
seasonings
and
peppers
are
used


cured
smoked
chorizo
can
be
eaten
without
cooking


fresh
chorizo
must
be
cooked
before
eating


it
can
be
eaten
by
its
self
or
as
part
of
meal


it
can
also
be
used
in

of
ground
beef

creativity
is
the
ability
of
a
person
or
group
to
make
something
new
and
useful
or
valuable
or
the
process
of
making
something
new
and
useful
or
valuable


it
happens
in
all
areas
of
life
science
art
literature
and
music


as
a
personal
ability
it
is
very
difficult
to
measure


the
reason
is
that
we
do
understand
the
mental
processes
that
help
some
people
be
more
creative
than
others


judging
what
is
creative
is
also
controversial


some
people
say
only
things
which
are
historically
new
are
creative
while
other
people
say
that
if
it
is
new
for
the
creator
and
the
people
around
them
then
it
is
also
creativity


some
think
creativity
is
an
important
thing
that
makes
humans
different
from
apes


others
recognize
that
even
apes
other
primates
other
mammals
and
some
birds
adapt
to
survive
by
being
creative
for
example
primates
using
tools


liane
believes
that
all
culture
comes
from
creativity
not
imitation


therefore
these
people
say
human
science
should
focus
on
it
pay
special
attention
to
it
ethics
for
example
would
focus
on
finding
creative
solutions
to
ethical
dilemmas


politics
would
focus
on
the
political
virtues
that
need
some
creativity


imitation
would
not
be
the
focus
of
education


linguistics
might
be
more
interested
in
how
new
words
are
created
by
culture
rather
than
in
how
existing
ones
are
used
in
grammar


intellectual
interests
recognized
as
intellectual
rights
or
intellectual
property
in
the
law
are
a
way
to
<collocation>reward creativity</collocation>
in
law
but
they
do
not
always
work
very
well


a
good
example
is
copyright
which
is
supposed
to
pay
authors
and
artists
but
may
only
pay
lawyers
to
make
imitative
arguments
in
court


creativity
is
a
central
question
in
economics
where
it
is
known
as
ingenuity
the
ability
to
come
up
with
new
ideas
or
individual
capital
capacities
that
individuals
have
that
do
not
arise
from
simple
imitation
of
what
is
known
already


this
is
separate
from
the
instructional
capital
that
might
try
to
capture
some
of
that
in
a
patent
or
training
system
that
helps
others
do
what
the
individual
leader
or
founder
of
the
system
can
do


in
urban
economics
there
are
various
ways
to
measure
creativity
the
bohemian
index
and
gay
index
are
two
attempts
to
do
this
accurately
and
predict
the
economic
growth
of
cities
based
on
creativity

principles
the
believed
that
the
world
had
been
made
by
a
bad
god


they
believed
that
this
bad
god
had
taken
them
from
the
good
god
and
put
them
in
the
world
but
inside
their
bodies
there
was
a
spirit
and
that
spirit
needed
to
return
to
the
good
god


they
were
famous
for
a
belief
in
a
form
of
reincarnation
and
believed
that
when
someone
died
the
bad
god
would
put
that
person
spirit
in
a
new
body


they
believed
this
cycle
of
coming
back
to
life
could
be
escaped
by
a
ritual
cleansing


they
were
opposed
to
the
doctrine
of
sin


women
were
prominent
in
the
faith


they
were
pacifists


they
did
eat
anything
that
was
made
from
other
animals
including
meat
and
cows
milk


the
only
exception
to
this
was
fish


fish
was
ok
to
eat
because
they
believed
fishes
were
not
alive
but
just
things
that
were
sometimes
produced
from
dirt
and
water


they
preached
tolerance
of
other
faiths


they
rejected
the
usual
christian
rules
of
marriage
and
only
believed
in
the
new
testament


an
earlier
century
bulgarian
heresy
and
also
started
some
of
these
trends


language
they
used
a
bible
in
the
language
people
spoke


many
other
christians
used
a
bible
in
latin


latin
was
spoken
only
by
the
priests

catholic
dominance

was
full

ravening

wolves

hypocrites

worshipping
the
wrong

right
in

of
the
most
powerful
catholics


in
the

wiped
out
the

it
was

suppressed

met
to
discuss
organizing
a
counter
church
in
the
south
of

the
languedoc
nobles
protected
it
and
many
noble
women
became
perfects


parish
clergy
had
low
morale
or
confidence


reactions
the
catholic
church
was
against
seeing
it
as
a
heresy


in
the
south
of
france
there
was
tremendous
<collocation>religious fervor</collocation>
and
an
economy
that
was
starting
to
grow
and
a
social
class
of
merchants
and
peasants
was
starting
to
grow


peasants
owned
their
own
land


meanwhile
in
other
parts
of
europe
peasants
were
forced
to
give
up
their
land
to
nobles
and
become
serfs
or
slaves
the
system
of
feudalism


there
was
a
strong
central
<collocation>absolute monarchy</collocation>
that
did
not
exist
in
the
south
of
france


the
burghers
and
bankers
had
more
power
in
this
looser
system


moore
is
a
historian
who
believes
that
it
was
desire
to
crush
this
system
and
take
over
the
land
that
drove
the
attack


however
there
was
real
cultural
and
religious
difference
to
cause
problems
who
combined
some
of
the
traditions
of
the
bards
of
the
celts
and
jews
were
both
part
of
the
<collocation>multicultural society</collocation>
in
the
south
of
france


their
influences
were
not
appreciated
by
local
or
roman
church
figures


the
century
roman
catholic
monks
were
founding
their
monasteries
outside
the
towns
drawing
the
best
people
there


results
the
thus
had
little
competition


the
perfects
the
good
men
or
good
women
lived
restrained
lives
and
spread
their
faith
in
towns
where
the
catholics
in
general
did
not
have
their
best
agents


also
preached
that
only
these
good
leaders
had
to
follow
the
regimens
their
whole
lives
lay
people
could
repent
only
on
their
deathbeds


many
century
christian
sects
have
similar
beliefs


the
<collocation>crusade methods</collocation>
the
pope
ordered
a
crusade
against
the
in
southern
france


he
said
any
crusader
who
answered
the
call
would
be
given
the
same
rewards
as
a
crusader
who
went
to
the
holy
land


this
was
an
absolution
of
all
sin


in
the
on
the
of
july
a
force
of
about
crusaders
arrived
at
the
walls
of
bearing
the
cross
pattee
to
mislead
and
create
ease
among
the
thinking
they
were
friend
not
foe
and
demanded
that
about
be
surrendered


the
people
of
the
town
who
were
mostly
catholic
said
that
rather
than
turn
over
their
friends
and
family
we
would
rather
be
flayed
alive


a
mistake
by
the
defenders
of
let
thousands
of
attackers
in


made
the
famous
quote
kill
them
all
god
knows
his
own
on
being
asked
how
to
tell
who
were
during
the
assault


everyone
in
the
town
was
killed
some
while
taking
refuge
in
the
church


it
is
guessed
that
were
killed
many
of
whom
were
catholics
and
not
at
all


the
crusade
became
known
as
the
crusade
after
the
town

it
was
to
wipe
out
the
almost
entirely
over
forty
or
so
years


the
crusaders
wanted
to
go
home
but
were
ordered
by
the
pope
to
continue
until
the
whole
south
of
france
was
controlled
and
all
were
dead


in
they
attacked
the
fortress
at
and
built
the
first
great
bonfire
of
heretics
beginning
the
practice
of
burning
at
the
stake
that
would
continue

it

to
note
that
at

fires
were

the
ran
down

threw
themselves

though
the

cosmology
is

first
used

the
study
of
the
universe
has
a
long
history


history
until
recently
people
thought
that
the
universe
was
the

they
thought
this
because
they
could
only
see
the
planets
up
to
saturn
and
stars


with
the
invention

our

is

france
in
the
early
days
of
christianity
people
had
to
worship
in
secret


christian
worship
was
not
allowed
in
the
roman
empire
so
christians
had
to
meet
in
a
secret
place


sometimes
they
met
in
people
houses
or
barns
sometimes
they
met
underground


the
first
places
that
were
built
for
christian
worship
were
small
chapels
that
were
cut
into
a
rock
where
people
could
worship
without
being
discovered


after
the
death
of
the
roman
emperor
in
christians
were
allowed
to
have
buildings
to
worship
in


these
first
churches
were
built
on
a
similar
plan
to
roman
basilicas


this
plan
was
later
used
for
the
fine
gothic
cathedrals
and
churches
that
were
built
at
the
end
of
the
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>


the
parts
of
a
church
further
list
of
church
architecture
terms
there
are
several
parts
in
the
architecture
of
a
church


not
all
churches
will
have
all
these
parts
the
nave
is
the
main
part
of
the
church
where
the
congregation
the
people
who
come
to
worship
sit


the
aisles
rhymes
with
piles
are
the
sides
of
the
church
which
may
run
along
the
side
of
the
nave


the
transept
if
there
is
one
is
an
area
which
crosses
the
nave
near
the
top
of
the
church


this
makes
the
church
shaped
like
a
cross
which
is
a
symbol
of
the
belief
that
jesus
died
on
the
cross


the
leads
up
to
the
altar
at
the
top
of
the
church


the
altar
is
in
the
sanctuary


the
word
sanctuary
means
sacred
place


people
were
not
allowed
to
be
arrested
in
the
sanctuary
so
they
were
safe


the
altar
is
usually
at
the
east
end
of
the
church


people
in
the
church
sit
facing
the
altar


we
say
that
the
church
faces
east


churches
will
also
have
a
tower
or
steeple
usually
at
the
west
end


if
the
church
has
a
transept
the
tower
may
be
above
the
center
of
the
transept


in
roman
catholic
churches
there
is
always
a
stoup
bowl
of
holy
water
near
the
entrance
of
the
church


this
tradition
comes
from
the
fact
that
roman
basilicas
had
a
fountain
for

some
churches

about
for
different
occasions

wall


the

holy
part
of
the
church
and
this
is
why
it
is
often
separated
from
the

by
a
screen
which
can

or
stone

the
top
of
these
seats
when
they
are
tipped
up
are
called
from
the
latin
word
for

this
is
because
the
priests
or
monks

to
lean
against
them
when
they
got
