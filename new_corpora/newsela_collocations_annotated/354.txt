evil
means
something
which
is
morally
bad
or
wicked


it
is
the
opposite
of
good


people
may
say
that
an
action
which
hurts
people
or
breaks
certain
rules
such
as
the
ten
commandments
is
evil


a
person
or
a
group
that
does
evil
things
may
also
be
called
evil


in
theology
there
is
a
question
if
there
is
a
god
why
does
god
let
evil
happen


some
think
that
evil
proves
that
there
is
not
a
god


others
think
that
god
lets
evil
happen
so
that
people
can
choose
not
to
do
evil


the
study
of
good
and
evil
in
philosophy
is
called
ethics


ethics
tries
to
explain
why
some
actions
are
good
and
other
actions
are
evil


it
attempts
to
give
all
kinds
of
answers
for
how
to
tell
evil
from
good


logical
problem
of
evil
a
version
of
the
problem
of
evil
perhaps
by
goes
as
follows
if
a
perfectly
good
god
exists
then
evil
does
not


there
is
evil
in
the
world


therefore
a
perfectly
good
god
does
not
exist


another
argument
goes
god
exists


god
is
omnipotent
omniscient
and
perfectly
good


a
perfectly
good
being
would
want
to
prevent
all
evils


an
omniscient
being
knows
every
way
in
which
evils
can
come
into
existence


an
omnipotent
being
who
knows
every
way
in
which
an
evil
can
come
into
existence
has
the
power
to
prevent
that
evil
from
coming
into
existence


a
being
who
knows
every
way
in
which
an
evil
can
come
into
existence
who
is
able
to
prevent
that
evil
from
coming
into
existence
and
who
wants
to
do
so
would
prevent
the
existence
of
that
evil


if
there
exists
an
omnipotent
omniscient
and
perfectly
good
being
then
no
evil
exists


evil
exists
logical
contradiction


arguments
such
as
these
are
about
the
logical
problem
of
evil


they
attempt
to
show
that
the
assumed
propositions
lead
to
a
logical
contradiction
and
so
can
not
all
be
correct


a
common
response
is
that
god
can
exist
with
and
allow
evil
in
order
to
achieve
a
greater
good


some
philosophers
accept
that
arguments
such
as
god
allows
evil
in
order
to
achieve
the
greater
good
of
free
will
are
logically
possible
and
thus
solve
the
logical
problem
of
evil


since
the
aim
is
only
to
defeat
the
assertion
that
god
and
evil
are
logically
incompatible
even
a
highly
implausible
instance
of
god
coexistence
with
evil
is
sufficient
for
the
purpose


philosophies
of
science
have
approached
the
problem
from
the
angle
of
empiricism


for
logical
the
issue
with
god
is
the
lack
of
any
independent
method
of
verification


in
their
view
this
makes
the
proposition
god
exists
not
true
or
false
but
meaningless


a
similar
position
points
to
the
lack
of
any
way
the
proposition
might
be
falsified


christians
believe
that
at
the
second
coming
of
christ
god
will
put
an
end
to
evil
and
the
works
of
the
devil
see
the
end
of
the
book
of
revelation
