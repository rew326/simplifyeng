name
wombats
image
wombat
in
snow


a
wombat
is
a
marsupial
in
the
family


it
lives
in
the
australian
<collocation>eucalyptus forests</collocation>


there
are
two
genera
with
three
living
wombat
species
the
<collocation>common wombat</collocation>
and
the
wombats


it
is
a
medium
sized
animal
that
makes
a
burrow
by
digging
holes
in
the
ground


wombats
are
usually
around
a
metre
in
long
when
they
are
fully
grown


it
is
a
kind
of
animal
known
as
a
marsupial
because
it
has
a
pouch
on
its
belly
that
holds
its
young
although
it
faces
back
instead
of
forward
like
most
marsupials


having
the
<collocation>pouch face</collocation>
backwards
prevents
dirt
from
building
up
in
the
pouch
and
hitting
the
offspring
in
the
face
when
digging


when
its
young
are
born
they
spend
some
time
growing
in
their
mother
pouch
before
going
into
the
world


wombats
are
herbivores


they
eat
plants
roots
and
grasses


they
are
nocturnal
which
means
they
sleep
in
the
day
and
come
out
at
night


some
wombats
have
thick
brown
fur
and
very
small
ears


they
can
weigh
from
to
kilograms
to
lb


they
can
live
up
to
years


wombats
are
commonly
known
and
recognized
by
their
waste
products


they
are
the
only
known
mammals
that
excrete
feces
in
cubic
shape


this
lets
people
easily
know
when
wombat
habitats
are
nearby


it
also
tells
simply
what
the
wombat
may
have
eaten
by
examining
the
feces
thoroughly
