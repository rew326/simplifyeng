cells
producing
electricity
the
simple
electrical
cells
were
first
developed
in


they
are
also
called
<collocation>galvanic cells</collocation>
because
an
italian
scientist
named
invented
these
cells


special
chemical
reactions
which
occur
inside
the
electrical
cell
result
in
oxidation
and
reduction
of
the
substances
inside
the
cell


this
produces
electrical
energy


normal
batteries
work
like
this


some
of
the
electrical
cells
produce
electricity
without
using
chemical
energy


for
example
solar
cells
produce
electricity
when
they
are
exposed
to
sun
light


these
cells
are
commonly
related
with
chemical
reactions


for
example
a
plate
of
zinc
and
a
plate
of
copper
are
immersed
in
a
dilute
solution
which
contains
acid
or
salt


the
solution
acts
as
an
electrolyte
electric
conductor


when
the
two
plates
are
connected
to
a
meter
with
a
wire
electric
current
will
pass
this
is
because
oxidation
and
reduction
processes
take
place
in
this
chemical
reaction
turning
the
zinc
plate
to
a
<collocation>negative electrode</collocation>
and
the
copper
plate
to
a
<collocation>positive electrode</collocation>
and
so
the
electrons
flows
from
zinc
to
copper
which
makes
the
meter
move


cells
using
electricity
some
chemical
reactions
need
high
energy
to
happen


an
example
is
the
breakdown
of
water
into
hydrogen
and
oxygen


an
electrical
cell
or
an
cell
is
used
for
these
reactions


it
is
a
container
which
has
to
have
a
chemical
reaction
involving
electrodes


the
chemical
substances
are
exposed
to
high
voltage
electrical
power
and
the
reaction
happens
inside
the
electrical
cell


two
pieces
of
metal
are
placed
in
water
that
has
a
little
electrolyte
such
as
hydrochloric
acid
sulfuric
acid
<collocation>sodium bicarbonate</collocation>
or
<collocation>sodium hydroxide</collocation>
added
to
it


an
electric
current
is
applied
and
gas
comes
out
of
each
electrode


some
color
may
be
seen
too
if
iron
was
used


there
may
also
be
a
chemical
reaction
which
will
result
in
the
explosion
of
the
iron
and
has
a
strong
blast

of
warfare
is
different
from
the
battles
fought
between

like

guerilla
warfare
is
when
small
units
fight
limited
battles
against
an
enemy
force
set
up
ambushes
make
surprise
attacks
against
the
enemies
camps
and
then
retreat
back
into
the
countryside
or
blend
into
the
local
population


it
also
includes
making
it
difficult
for
the
enemy
to
operate
by
engaging
in
sabotage
and
harassing
the
enemy
with
lethal
means
such
as
booby
traps


the
communist
troops
more
often
engaged
in
guerilla
warfare
against
the
south
vietnamese
and
american
troops


although
most
traps
were
there
were
a
few
<collocation>explosive traps</collocation>
which
all
used
grenades


a
trip
wire
was
placed
and
if
a
soldier
tripped
over
the
wire
a
grenade
pin
was
pulled
out
and
the
grenade
would
blow
killing
the
soldier


another
style
of
trap
was
nicknamed
<collocation>venus flytrap</collocation>


it
had
about
eight
barbs
attached
to
a
<collocation>rectangular frame</collocation>
sitting
on
a
small
hole


the
barbs
were
facing
down
so
when
the
soldier
leg
got
caught
in
it
it
would
hurt
until
he
pulled
his
leg
out


when
he
pulled
his
leg
out
the
barbs
would
rip
through
his
leg


another
vietcong
trap
was
the
trap


two
wooden
platforms
were
placed
and
covered
with
leaves
to
camouflage
it


there
were
spikes
on
the
inside
of
the
wood


when
a
soldier
came
along
and
walked
on
the
wood
it
caved
in
and
the
spikes
would
go
through
the
soldier
foot


these
traps
were
the
most
common
because
they
were
the
cheapest
and
very
effective


they
also
were
often
contaminated
so
that
the
soldier
would
also
become
infected


besides
hurting
or
killing
people
these
traps
were
good
at
causing
fear
and
lowering
soldier
morale

a
chemical
change
chemical
reaction
is
a
change
of
materials
into
other
new
materials
with
different
properties
and
one
or
more
new
substances
are
formed


burning
of
wood
is
a
chemical
change
as
new
substances
which
can
not
be
changed
back
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
water
vapor
are
formed


for
example
if
wood
is
burned
in
a
fire
place
there
is
not
wood
anymore
but
ash


other
examples
include
burning
of
a
candle
rusting
of
iron
baking
a
cake


special
details
that
describe
how
a
chemical
change
takes
place
are
called
chemical
properties


compare
physical
change
the
opposite
of
a
chemical
change
is
a
physical
change


physical
changes
are
a
change
in
which
no
new
substances
are
formed
and
the
substance
which
is
changed
is
the
same


for
instance
if
a
stick
of
wood
is
broken
there
is
still
a
stick
of
wood
it
is
just
broken


more
examples
include
changes
of

changes
of
states
passing
electricity
through
a

breaking
of
wood
shattering
of
glass
pouring

special
details
which
do
not
change
in
a
substance
without
new
substances
being
formed
are
called
physical
properties


burning
wood
is
an
example
of
a
chemical
change
that
is
not

a
physical
change
is
a
change
in
which
no
new
substances
are

and
most
physical

are
reversible
