financial
capital
is
a
form
of
capital


it
is
things
that
have
value
but
do
not
do
anything
by
themselves


they
are
only
valuable
because
people
value
want
them


for
example
money
is
a
form
of
financial
capital


you
can
not
do
anything
with
money
but
it
still
has
value


financial
capital
is
used
to
pay
for
things
this
is
because
there
is
always
more
of
it
and
people
always
want
it


this
means
that
financial
capital
has
a
stable
value
and
can
be
traded
in
most
places
and
with
most
people


some
forms
of
financial
capital
such
as
stocks
gold
or
bonds
are
not
wanted
by
everybody


however
they
can
be
traded
with
people
for
money
or
another
type
of
financial
capital


because
of
this
these
forms
of
financial
capital
do
not
have
a
stable
price


this
means
that
some
people
try
to
make
a
profit
by
buying
and
selling
these
types
of
financial
capital
in
a
market


some
things
are
treated
as
financial
capital
even
though
they
do
have
a
use


for
example
some
people
buy
and
sell
land
but
are
not
interested
in
doing
anything
with
it


some
people
think
this
sort
of
trade
is
bad
because
the
land
should
be
used
and
not
just
treated
like
money


other
types
of
capital
such
as
social
capital
and
human
capital
are
rarely
treated
like
financial
capital


this
may
be
because
they
involve
people


treating
useful
capital
like
financial
capital
is
called


in
politics
a
common
question
is
how
often
the
government
should
use
financial
capital


in
particular
should
the
government
use
financial
capital
to
make
a
profit


traditionally
liberal
politicians
do
not
mind
this
kind
of
trading
for
profit
but
socialist
or
conservative
politicians
are
against
it

lee
creator
of
the
fecund
universes
theory
fecund
universes
is
a
multiverse
theory
of
lee


it
relies
on
models
of
our
universe
and
statistics
from
astrophysics
but
is
more
correctly
a
theory
of
cosmology


in
this
theory
collapsing
stars
or
black
holes
are
always
creating
new
universes
with
slightly
different
laws
of
physics


because
these
laws
are
only
slightly
different
each
is
assumed
to
be
like
a
mutation
of
the
original
universe
as
if
each
universe
was
a
kind
of
organism


it
would
reproduce
by
splitting
in
some
sense


this
theory
relies
on
many
models
of
our
universe
to
model
these
mutated
alternative
universes
the
ones
that
supposes
are
generated
or
spun
off
by
black
holes


no
human
can
ever
be
part
of
any
of
these
other
universes


observations
from
astrophysics
can
only
say
if
the
black
holes
exist
or
are
common
and
give
some
idea
of
how
much
the
laws
of
physics
can
vary
and
still
let
the
new
universes
produce
new
black
holes


predicts
that
there
would
be
many
black
holes
in
the
universe
humans
can
see
since
they
are
likely
in
a
very
late
born
universe
by
simple
probability


if
there
are
many
black
holes
that
is
evidence
for
his
theory
as
this
shows
cosmology
has
a
very
different
standard
of
evidence
and
burden
of
proof
than
is
required
for
models
of
our
universe
only
which
humans
using
mathematics
can
observe
and
exchange
knowledge
on


it
is
hard
to
separate
science
from
religion
on
such
questions


it
may
be
a
simple
matter
of
preference
whether
one
wants
to
see
one
universe
as
part
of
a
system
like
biology
or
like
mechanics
clockwork


theory
is
important
mostly
because
it
challenges
the
mechanistic
paradigm


even
if
it
is
wrong
it
raises
the
idea
that
living
beings
might
have
to
see
their
universe
as
also
living
to
be
able
to
understand
or
care
about
it
at
all


some
compare
theory
to
philosophy
which
combines
biology
geology
and
ecology
to
explain
the
earth
our
planet
as
a
living
thing


if
both
are
right
humans
are
on
a
living
planet
in
a
living
universe


this
idea
is
very
appealing
which
does
not
mean
it
is
really
right


some
think
both
are
a
kind
of
religion
