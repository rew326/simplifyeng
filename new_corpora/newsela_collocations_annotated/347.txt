global
as
an
adjective
is
used
to
mean
the
entire
world
rather
than
any
special
place


it
is
also
used
in
fields
like
computers
to
mean
dealing
with
a
whole
larger
system
as
distinguished
from
its
individual
little
parts


history
the
fact
that
the
earth
is
a
sphere
was
established
by
hellenistic
astronomy
in
the
century


the
earliest
globe
of
the
earth
appeared
in
that
period


the
earliest
known
example
is
the
one
made
by
crates
of
in
now
in
turkey
in
the
century


no
globes
of
the
earth
from
antiquity
or
the
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>
have
survived


an
example
of
a
surviving
celestial
globe
is
part
of
a
<collocation>hellenistic sculpture</collocation>
called
the
atlas


it
survives
in
a
century
ad
roman
copy
in
the
naples
museum
naples
italy


early
globes
of
the
earth
that
show
all
of
the
old
world
were
constructed
in
the
islamic
golden
age


one
such
example
was
made
in
the
century
by
<collocation>muslim geographers</collocation>
and
cartographers
working
under
the
caliph
mun


another
example
was
the
globe
introduced
to
by
the
persian
astronomer
in


the
oldest
surviving
globe
of
the
earth
is
credited
to
martin
in
germany
in


a
copy
of
the
globe
showing
america
was
made
by
martin
in


another
early
globe
the
globe
is
thought
to
be
the
source
of
the
phrase
here
be
dragons


another
remarkably
globe
of
the
earth
was
made
by
at
the
<collocation>istanbul observatory</collocation>
of
during
the


manufacture
gores
for
making
a
globe
of
mars
with
<collocation>polar disks</collocation>
globes
are
typically
covered
by
a
printed
paper
map


the
most
common
type
has
long
<collocation>thin gores</collocation>
strips
of
paper


these
<collocation>strips narrow</collocation>
to
a
point
at
the
north
pole
and
the
south
pole


then
a
small
disk
is
used
to
paper
over
the
irregularities
at
the
poles


the
more
gores
there
are
the
less
stretching
and
is
needed
to
make
the
paper
map
fit
the
sphere


from
a
geometric
point
of
view
all
points
on
a
sphere
are
the
same


one
could
select
any
point
on
the
earth
and
create
a
paper
map
that
covers
the
earth
with
strips
that
come
together
at
that
point
and
the
opposite
point


an
earth
globe
is
usually
mounted
at
a
angle
on
bearings


this
mounting
represents
the
angle
of
the
planet
in
relation
to
its
sun
and
the
spin
of
the
planet


this
makes
it
easy
to
visualize
how
days
and
seasons
change
