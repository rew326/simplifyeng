the

called


ad
is
a
latin
term


it
is
used
in
rhetoric


rhetoric
is
the
science
of
how
to
speak
well
and
how
to
convince
other
people
of
your
ideas


translated
to
english
ad
means
against
the
person
latin
homo
where
is
a
form
is
gender
neutral


in
ancient
rome
it
referred
to
all
free
men
and
by
extension
to
all
free
human
beings


the
term
is
used
to
describe
a
rhetorical
argument
that
is
directed
towards
the
person
who
says
something
not
about
the
cause
at
hand


it
is
a
way
to
use
reputation
and
rumor
and
hearsay
to
change
minds


when
a
social
network
has
already
excluded
or
exiled
one
person
or
applied
a
label
to
them
this
works
more
often


because
it
works
and
is
also
unfair
to
everyone
who
would
benefit
from
what
they
say
it
is
considered
to
be
a
weak
or
poor
argument


formal
disapproval
of
those
who
use
it
is
common
in
a
court
or
in
diplomacy
where
danger
is
high

history
the
apple
tree
was
possibly
the
earliest
tree
to
be
cultivated


its
fruits
have
become
better
over
thousands
of
years


it
is
said
that
alexander
the
great
discovered
dwarfed
apples
in
asia
minor
in


asia
and
europe
have
used
winter
apples
as
an
important
food
for
thousands
of
years


from
when
europeans
arrived
argentina
and
the
united
states
have
used
apples
as
food
as
well


apples
were
brought
to
north
america
in
the


the
first
<collocation>apple orchard</collocation>
on
the
north
american
continent
was
said
to
be
near
boston
in


in
the
costly
fruit
industries
where
the
apple
was
a
very
important
species
began
developing


in
culture
<collocation>germanic paganism</collocation>
as
by
carl
in
norse
mythology
the
goddess
gives
apples
to
the
gods
in
prose
edda
written
in
the
century
by
that
makes
them
young
forever


english
scholar
suggests
that
apples
were
related
to
religious
practices
in
<collocation>germanic paganism</collocation>


it
was
from
there
she
claims
that
<collocation>norse paganism</collocation>
developed


she
points
out
that
buckets
of
apples
were
discovered
in
the
place
of
burial
for
the
ship
in
norway


she
also
remarks
that
fruit
and
nuts
having
been
described
as
changing
into
a
nut
in
have
been
discovered
in
the
early
graves
of
the
germanic
peoples
in
england


they
have
also
been
discovered
somewhere
else
on
the
continent
of
europe


she
suggests
that
this
may
have
had
a
symbolic
meaning


nuts
are
still
a
symbol
of
fertility
in
southwest
england


sometimes
apples
are
eaten
after
they
are
cooked


often
apples
are
eaten
uncooked


apples
can
also
be
made
into
drinks


apple
juice
and
apple
cider
are
apple
drinks


the
flesh
of
the
fruit
is
firm
with
a
taste
anywhere
from
sour
to
sweet


apples
used
for
cooking
are
sour
and
need
to
be
cooked
with
sugar
while
other
apples
are
sweet
and
do
not
need
cooking


there
are
some
seeds
at
the
core
that
can
be
removed
with
a
tool
that
removes
the
core
or
by
carefully
using
a
knife


the
scientific
name
of
the
apple
tree
genus
in
the
latin
language
is


most
apples
that
people
grow
are
of
the
species


most
apples
are
good
to
eat
raw
not
cooked
and
are
also
used
in
many
kinds
of
baked
foods
such
as
<collocation>apple pie</collocation>


apples
are
cooked
until
they
are
soft
to
make
<collocation>apple sauce</collocation>


apples
are
also
made
into
the
drinks
apple
juice
and
cider


usually
cider
contains
a
little
alcohol
about
as
much
as
beer


the
regions
of
in
france
and
cornwall
in
england
are
known
for
their
apple


if
one
wants
to
grow
a
certain
type
of
apple
it
is
not
possible
to
do
this
by
planting
a
seed
from
the
wanted
type


the
seed
will
have
from
the
apple
that
the
seeds
came
from
but
it
will
also
have
from
the
apple
flower
that
pollinated
the
seeds
which
may
well
be
a
different
type


this
means
that
the

which
would

would
be

a

recognize
abraham
as
an

person


the
best
known
and
probably
most
popular
religions
are
judaism
christianity
islam
and
the
faith


even
though
these
religions
are
different
from
each

in

ways
they
also
agree
in
many
other
very

ways
on
the

nature

god
whom
they
worship


the
word
refers
to
the
ancient
prophet
abraham
who
is
respected
in
judaism
christianity
and
islam


another
thing
religions
have
in
common
is
that
they
are
from
the

words
for

algebra
is
a
part
of
mathematics
often
called
math
in
the
united
states
and
maths
in
the
<collocation>united kingdom</collocation>


it
uses
variables
to
represent
a
value
that
is
not
yet
known


when
an
equals
sign
is
used
this
is
called
an
equation


a
very
simple
equation
using
a
variable
is
x
in
this
example
x
or
it
could
also
be
said
x
is
five


this
is
called
solving
for
x


besides
equations
there
are
inequalities
less
than
and
greater
than


a
special
type
of
equation
is
called
the
function


this
is
often
used
in
making
graphs


algebra
can
be
used
to
solve
real
problems
because
the
rules
of
algebra
work
in
real
life
and
numbers
can
be
used
to
represent
the
values
of
real
things


physics
engineering
and
computer
programming
are
areas
that
use
algebra
all
the
time


it
is
also
useful
to
know
in
surveying
construction
and
business
especially
accounting


people
who
do
algebra
need
to
know
the
rules
of
numbers
and
mathematic
operations
used
on
numbers
starting
with
adding
subtracting
multiplying
and
dividing


more
advanced
operations
involve
exponents
starting
with
squares
and
square
roots


many
of
these
rules
can
also
be
used
on
the
variables
and
this
is
where
it
starts
to
get
interesting


algebra
was
first
used
to
solve
equations
and
inequalities


two
examples
are
<collocation>linear equations</collocation>
the
equation
of
a
line
y
b
and
quadratic
equations
which
has
variables
that
are

history
early
forms
of
algebra
were
developed
by
the
babylonians
and
the
greeks


however
the
word
algebra
is
a
latin
form
of
the
arabic
word
casting
and
comes
from
a
mathematics
book
fi
essay
on
the
computation
of
casting
and
equation
written
in
the
century
by
a
famous
persian
mathematician
muhammad
who
was
a
muslim
born
in
in


he
flourished
under
in
baghdad
iraq
through
ad
and
died
around
ad


the
book
was
brought
into
europe
and
translated
into
latin
in
the
century


the
book
was
then
given
the
name
algebra


the
ending
of
the
mathematician
name
was
changed
into
a
word
easier
to
say
in
latin
and
became
the
english
word
algorithm


examples
here
is
a
simple
example
of
an
algebra
problem
sue
has
jellybeans
ann
has
jellybeans


they
decide
to
share
so
that
they
have
the
same
number
of
jellybeans


these
are
the
steps
you
can
use
to
solve
the
problem
to
have
the
same
number
of
jellybeans
ann
has
to
give
some
to
sue


let
x
represent
the
number
of
jellybeans
ann
gives
to
sue


sue
jellybeans
plus
x
must
be
the
same
as
ann
jellybeans
minus
x


this
is
written
as
x
x
subtract
from
both
sides
of
the
equation


this
gives
x
x


what
happens
on
one
side
of
the
equals
sign
must
happen
on
the
other
side
too
for
the
equation
to
still
be
true


so
in
this
case
when
was
subtracted
from
both
sides
there
was
a
middle
step
of
x
x


after
a
person
is
comfortable
with
this
the
middle
step
is
not
written
down


add
x
to
both
sides
of
the
equation


this
gives
divide
both
sides
of
the
equation
by


this
gives
x


the
answer
is
six


if
ann
gives
sue
jellybeans
they
will
have
the
same
number
of
jellybeans


to
check
this
put
back
into
the
original
equation
wherever
x
was
this
gives
which
is
true


they
both
now
have
jellybeans


with
practice
algebra
can
be
used
when
faced
with
a
problem
that
is
too
hard
to
solve
any
other
way


problems
such
as
building
a
freeway
designing
a
cell
phone
or
finding
the
cure
for
a
disease
all
require
algebra


writing
algebra
as
in
most
parts
of
mathematics
adding
z
to
y
or
y
plus
z
is
written
as
y
z


subtracting
z
from
y
or
y
minus
z
is
written
as
y
z


dividing
y
by
z
or
y
over
z
y
over
z
is
written
as
y
z
or
