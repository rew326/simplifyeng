invention
wooden
around
the
first
in
a
german
professor
baron
von
created
the
first
two
wheeled
bicycle


it
was
made
of
wood
and
had
two
wheels


the
front
wheel
could
be
turned
using
the
handlebars
in
order
to
steer
the
bike


however
it
did
not
have
pedals
so
the
rider
would
have
to
push
their
feet
on
the
ground
to
make
it
move


in
the
french
inventors
added
pedals
to
the
front
wheel


however
it
took
a
lot
of
effort
to
turn
the
pedals


later
inventors
made
bikes
out
of
metal
only
and
made
the
front
wheel
very
big
giving
higher
speed


this
design
was
called
the
bicycle


however
it
was
difficult
to
ride
since
it
could
fall
easily
and
the
rider
would
fall
far


several
improvements
were
made
in
the
and


in
the
safety
bicycle
was
invented


this
had
two
wheels
the
same
size
so
that
the
rider
could
sit
at
a
lower
height


it
was
called
the
safety
bicycle
because
it
much
easier
to
ride
than
the


when
stopping
the
rider
can
simply
put
down
a
foot
instead
of
completely
dismounting


instead
of
pedaling
and
steering
with
the

the

steers

in
scottish
inventor
john
a
type
of
tire
which
was
filled
with
air
and
this
made
cycling
far
more
comfortable


soon
the
was
invented


this
was
a
device
inside
the
hub
of
the
back
wheel
that
allowed
the
wheel
to
spin
even
if
the
rider
was
pedalling


however
this
meant
the
rider
could
no
longer
stop
the
bike
by


as
a
result
a
different
type
of
brake
was
invented
which
could
stop
the
bike
if
the
pedals
were
turned
backwards


later
inventions
included
better
brakes
and
gears
which
made
cycling
over
hills
much
easier


during
this
time
the
bicycle
became
very
popular

basic

include
a

gearing
handlebar
wheels
brakes
and

all
mounted
on

the

also
have
a

the
cyclist
uses
legs
to
turn
the
pedals
around
in
circles

safety
when

it
is
safest
to
ride
on

percent
means

it
is
often
shown
with
the
symbol


it
is
used
even
if
there
are
not
a
hundred
items


the
number
is
then
scaled
so
it
can
be
compared
to
one
hundred


percentages
are
one
way
of
writing
numbers
you
can
also
write
percentages
as
fractions
or
decimals

a
bowl

are
separate

all
these

started
with

that
stood
for
things


then
they
developed
a
mixture
of
methods


our
own
system
is
different


it

based
on
the
sounds
of
spoken
language


all
are

versions
of

the
developed
a
form
of
writing
called
cuneiform


<collocation>triangular marks</collocation>
were
pressed
into
soft
<collocation>clay tablets</collocation>


after
the
clay
had
dried
in
the
sun
the
tablets
were
baked


then
they
were
carried
somewhere
else
for
others
to
read


we
know
that
its
first
uses
were
for
trade
accounting
and
administration


the
earliest
signs
were
mostly
pictorial
but
soon
they
stood
as
symbols
for
objects
ideas
and
sounds


this
writing
system
was
extremely
successful
and
outlasted
the
<collocation>sumerian empire</collocation>


it
was
then
used
by

civilisations
in
the
middle

such
as
the
<collocation>old akkadian</collocation>
babylonian
assyrian
hittite
old

and
empires


the
last
cuneiform
inscription
was
dated
as

thus
the
system
had
lasted
for
more
than
years


each
version
of
cuneiform
had
to
be
deciphered
separately
because
all
the
languages
were
different


documents
including
stone
objects
written
in
more
than

language
provided
the
clues

forms

scripts


it
was
invented
at
roughly
the
same
time
as
cuneiform
yet
was
quite
different
in
style
and
used
different
materials


egyptians
ended
up
with
three
writing
systems
for
the
same
language


they
were


hieroglyphic
the
famous
pictorial
language
on
stone
monuments


hieratic
a
cursive
running
script
used
by
the
priests


demotic
a
<collocation>cursive script</collocation>
used
by
the
people


the
writing
tools
used
varied
according
to
the
material
which
was
written
on


the
two
cursive
scripts
were
written
with
<collocation>reed pens</collocation>
and
carbon
inks
onto
papyrus


if
the
material
was
cloth
then
the
writing
was
done
by
a
brush


many
examples
survive


the
hieroglyphs
were
carved
into
stone
hammer
chisel
or
painted
onto
stone
surfaces


many
survive
some
with
the
original
colors
intact


the
key
event
in
the
of
hieroglyphic
writing
was
the
discovery
of
the
stone


this
is
a
granite
slab
with
the
same
message
written
in
hieroglyphic
demotic
and
in
greek


ancient
greek
is
well
understood
and
made
possible
the
interpretation
of
the
other

the
chinese
writing
system
is
a
mixed
method
using
characters
which
may
have
one
or
more
of

elements


pictographic
representing

visual

complex

the

is
a

sounds
like
the
character
for
wheat
is
also
used
for
come
because
the
words
are
sound
alike


combination
of
a
character
for
meaning
with
another
for

these
are
chinese
characters


the

printing
methods
were
never
really
successful
in
china
despite
their
early
invention


in
the

wang
had
sixty

cut
a

the
composition

china
has
eight
regional

there
have
been
a

attempts
to
reform

the
most

is
a
program
to
replace
chinese
characters

this
was
supported
by

faltered
after
