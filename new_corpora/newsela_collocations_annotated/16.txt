churches
through
the
ages
the
design
of
churches
changed
a
lot
during
the
course
of
history


often
churches
were
made
bigger


when
this
happened
there
may
be
a
mixture
of
<collocation>architectural styles</collocation>


these
styles
vary
a
lot
in
different
countries


english
churches
in
english
churches
there
were
several
different
periods
of
architecture
the
saxon
period
was
a
time
when
churches
were
very
simple


the
end
of
the
church
end
of
the
sanctuary
was
often
rounded


hardly
any
are
left
now
because
they
were
mostly
made
of
wood


the
norman
period
came
from
the
style
called
romanesque
which
was
popular
in
europe


the
arches
had
ornaments
which
were
called


the
tops
of
the
pillars
looked
like
cushions
so
they
were
called
<collocation>cushion capitals</collocation>


the
windows
were
narrow
and
rounded
at
the
top


early
english
or
gothic
architecture
was
not
as
solid
and
heavy
as
norman
architecture


towers
were
elegant
and
tall
like
the
tower
of
<collocation>salisbury cathedral</collocation>


the
decorated
style
of
architecture
was
popular
at
a
time
when
the
plague
black
death
was
raging
and
a
third
of
the
people
in
england
died


for
that
reason
not
so
much
building
was
done
then


there
were
lots
of
stone
carvings
were
made
in
churches
at
that
time


the
perpendicular
style
was
very
grand


it
had
lots
of
straight
upward
lines
and
fan
vaulting


this
can
be
seen
in
<collocation>westminster abbey</collocation>
and
king
college
chapel
cambridge


many
churches
that
can
be
seen
in
england
were
built
in
this
period


in
the
churches
were
built
in
a
variety
of
styles


often
they
copied
some
of
the
older
styles


after
the
great
fire
of
london
many
new
churches
were
built
by
the
architect
sir
christopher
wren


they
were
built
in
the
classical
style


churches
continued
to
be
built
in
later
centuries
like
this
but
also
the
gothic
style
continued
to
be
used


modern
churches
often
do
not
have
the
traditional


it
is
difficult
for
the
congregation
to
see
and
hear
what
is
happening
in
the


modern
churches
bring
the
congregation
choir
and
priests
in
closer
touch


an
example
is
the
round
design
for
the
church
of
christ
the
cornerstone
in
milton


modern
churches
are
often
simpler
but
with
a
warmer
character
than
the
gothic
churches


many
have
beautiful
mosaic
glass
windows

that
is

all
over

to
decide
why
some
places
are
called

and
other
places
are
called

some
things
that

are
a

area


the
sizes
of
cities
can
be
very
different


this
depends
on
the
type
of
city
that
it
is


cities
that
were
built
hundreds
of
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
and
which
have
not
changed
much
are
very
much
smaller
than
modern
cities


there
are
two
main
reasons


one
reason
is
that
old
cities
often
have
a
city
wall
and
most
of
the
city
is
inside
it


another
important
reason
is
that
the
streets
in
old
cities
are
often
narrow


if
the
city
got
too
big
it
was
hard
for
a
cart
carrying
food
to
get
to
the
market
place


people
in
cities
need
food
and
the
food
always
has
to
come
from
outside
the
city


cities
that
were
on
a
river
like
london
could
grow
much
bigger
than
cities
that
were
on
a
mountain
like
sienna
in
italy
because
the
river
made
a
transport
route
for
carrying
food
and
other
goods
as
well
as
for
transporting
people


london
has
been
changing
continually
for
hundreds
of
years
while
siena
which
was
a
very
important
city
in
the
has
changed
very
little
in
years


modern
cities
with
modern
transport
systems
can
grow
very
large
because
the
streets
are
wide
enough
for
cars
buses
and
trucks
and
there
are
often
railway
lines
as
well


in
the
us
the
word
city
is
often
used
for
towns
that
are
not
very
big


when
the
first
european
people
went
to
america
they
gave
the
name
city
to
new
places


they
hoped
the
places
would
be
great
cities
in
the
future


for
example
salt
lake
city
was
the
name
given
to
a
village
of
people


when
they
started
building
the
town
they
made
street
plans
and
called
it
great
salt
lake
city
for
the
nearby
great
salt
lake


now
years
later
it
really
is
a
big
city


in
modern
times
many
cities
have
grown
bigger
and
bigger


the
whole
area
is
often
called
a
metropolis
and
can
sometimes
includes
several
small
ancient
towns
and
villages


the
metropolis
of
london
includes
the
city
of
london
the
city
of
westminster
and
many
old
villages
such
as
hill
richmond
greenwich
and


the
part
that
is
officially
known
as
the
city
of
london
only
takes
up
one
<collocation>square mile</collocation>


the
rest
is
known
as
greater
london


many
other
cities
have
grown
in
the
same
way


these
giant
cities
can
be
exciting
places
to
live
and
many
people
can
find
good
jobs
there
but
modern
cities
also
have
many
problems


many
people
can
not
find
jobs
in
the
cities
and
have
to
get
money
by
begging
or
by
crime


cars
factories
and
waste
create
a
lot
of
pollution
that
makes
people
sick

the

soon

began
to

cities

before
foods
are
cooked
we
say
they
are
raw


some
foods
are
good
to
eat
raw


other
foods
are
not
good
for
the
body
when
they

they
must
be
cooked

foods
are
good
to

either

recipes

in

of

by
hon
a
crime
or
misdemeanor
or
felony
is
an
act
done
by
a
person
which
is
against
the
laws
of
a
country
or
region


a
person
who
does
this
is
called
a
criminal


the
basic
idea
of
what
things
are
called
crimes
is
that
they
are
thought
to
be
things
that
might
cause
a
problem
for
another
person


things
like
killing
another
person
injuring
another
person
or
stealing
from
another
person
are
crimes
in
most
countries


also
it
can
be
a
crime
to
eat
some
types
of
food
such
as
meat
of
<collocation>rare exotic</collocation>
animals
marijuana
leaves
or
mushrooms
that
contain

when
some
criminals
make
money
from
crime
they
try
to
stop
the
police
finding
out
where
the
money
came
from
by
<collocation>money laundering</collocation>


levels
of
crime
there
are
various
levels
of
crimes
misdemeanor
is
a
minor
crime
typically
punished
by
a
fee
or
less
than
year
in
jail


felony
or
high
crime
is
a
major
crime
typically
punished
by
year
or
longer
in
prison


different
countries
have
many
different
ideas
of
what
things
are
crimes
and
which
are
severe
enough
to
be
treated
as
felonies


some
things
that
are
crimes
in
one
country
are
not
crimes
in
other
countries


many
countries
get
their
ideas
of
what
things
are
crimes
from
religions
or
controversial
events
which
cause
a
law
to
be
quickly
created


for
example
a
religion
might
consider
eating
a
particular
food
to
be
a
crime


another
example
is
the
new
ban
in
some
regions
on
texting
while
driving
an
automobile
which
was
created
after
people
died
in
wrecks
when
they
were
distracted
by
<collocation>mobile phone</collocation>
messages


in
many
countries
if
people
say
they
made
or
wrote
a
book
movie
song
or
web
page
that
they
did
not
really
make
or
write
it
is
a
crime
against
<collocation>copyright laws</collocation>


in
many
countries
helping
to
grow
make
move
or
sell
illegal
drugs
is
a
crime


in
most
countries
police
try
to
stop
crimes
and
to
find
criminals


when
the
police
find
someone
who
they
think
might
be
a
criminal
they
usually
hold
the
person
in
a
jail


then
usually
a
court
or
a
judge
decides
if
the
person
really
did
a
crime


if
the
court
or
judge
decides
that
the
person
really
did
it
then
he
or
she
might
have
to
pay
a
fine
or
go
to
prison


sometimes
the
judge
might
decide
that
the
criminal
should
be
executed

this
is
called
capital
