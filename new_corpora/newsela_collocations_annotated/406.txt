it
is
a
term
of
convenience
for
most
biologists
it
does
not
suggest
any
change
in
the
process
of
evolution


for
some
palaeontologists
what
they
see
in
the
fossil
record
can
not
be
explained
just
by
the
<collocation>evolutionary synthesis</collocation>


they
are
in
the
minority


altruism
and
group
selection
main
<collocation>kin selection</collocation>
altruism
the
willingness
of
some
to
sacrifice
themselves
for
others
is
widespread
in
social
animals


as
explained
above
the
next
generation
can
only
come
from
those
who
survive
and
reproduce


some
biologists
have
thought
that
this
meant
altruism
could
not
evolve
by
the
normal
process
of
selection


instead
a
process
called
group
selection
was
proposed


group
selection
refers
to
the
idea
that
alleles
can
become
fixed
or
spread
in
a
population
because
of
the
benefits
they
bestow
on
groups
regardless
of
the
alleles
effect
on
the
fitness
of
individuals
within
that
group


for
several
decades
critiques
cast
serious
doubt
on
group
selection
as
a
major
mechanism
of
evolution


in
simple
cases
it
can
be
seen
at
once
that
traditional
selection
suffices


for
example
if
one
sibling
sacrifices
itself
for
three
siblings
the
genetic
disposition
for
the
act
will
be
increased


this
is
because
siblings
share
on
average
of
their
genetic
inheritance
and
the
<collocation>sacrificial act</collocation>
has
led
to
greater
representation
of
the
genes
in
the
next
generation


altruism
is
now
generally
seen
as
emerging
from
standard
selection


the
warning
note
from
and
the
work
of
william
hamilton
are
both
important
to
this
discussion


hamilton
equation
hamilton
equation
describes
whether
or
not
a
gene
for
<collocation>altruistic behavior</collocation>
will
spread
in
a
population


the
gene
will
spread
if
r
x
b
is
greater
than
c
c
where
c
is
the
reproductive
cost
to
the
altruist
b
is
the
<collocation>reproductive benefit</collocation>
to
the
recipient
of
the
<collocation>altruistic behavior</collocation>
and
r
is
the
probability
above
the
population
average
of
the
individuals
sharing
an
<collocation>altruistic gene</collocation>
the
degree
of


<collocation>sexual reproduction</collocation>
main
sex
at
first
<collocation>sexual reproduction</collocation>
might
seem
to
be
at
a
disadvantage
compared
with
asexual
reproduction


in
order
to
be
advantageous
<collocation>sexual reproduction</collocation>
has
to
overcome
a
disadvantage
takes
two
to
reproduce
plus
the
difficulty
of
finding
a
mate


why
then
is
sex
so
nearly
universal
among


this
is
one
of
the
oldest
questions
in
biology


the
answer
has
been
given
since
darwin
time
because
the
sexual
populations
adapt
better
to
changing
circumstances


a
recent
laboratory
experiment
suggests
this
is
indeed
the
correct
explanation


when
populations
are
genetic
recombination
occurs
between
different
parental
genomes


this
allows
beneficial
mutations
to
escape
deleterious
alleles
on
its
original
background
and
to
combine
with
other
beneficial
alleles
that
arise
elsewhere
in
the
population


in
populations
individuals
are
largely
and
recombination
has
no
effect


in
the
main
experiment
worms
were
divided
into
two
groups


one
group
was
entirely
the
other
was
entirely


the
groups
were
subjected
to
a
rugged
terrain
and
repeatedly
subjected
to
a
mutagen


after
generations
the
population
showed
a
<collocation>substantial decline</collocation>
in
fitness
survival
whereas
the
population
showed
no
decline


this
is
one
of
a
number
of
studies
that
show
sexuality
to
have
real
advantages
over
types
of
reproduction


what
evolution
is
used
for
today
an
important
activity
is
<collocation>artificial selection</collocation>
for


this
is
when
people
choose
which
animals
to
breed
from
based
on
their
traits


humans
have
used
this
for
thousands
of
years
to
domesticate
plants
and
animals


more
recently
it
has
become
possible
to
use
genetic
engineering


new
techniques
such
as
gene
targeting
are
now
available


the
purpose
of
this
is
to
insert
new
genes
or
knock
out
old
genes
from
the
genome
of
a
plant
or
animal


a
number
of
nobel
prizes
have
already
been
awarded
for
this
work


however
the
real
purpose
of
studying
evolution
is
to
explain
and
help
our
understanding
of
biology


after
all
it
is
the
first
good
explanation
of
how
living
things
came
to
be
the
way
they
are


that
is
a
big
achievement


the
practical
things
come
mostly
from
genetics
the
science
started
by
gregor
mendel
and
from
molecular
and

biology

responses
to
the
idea
of
evolution
main
social
responses
to
the
idea
of
evolution
debates
about
the
fact
of
evolution
as
darwinism
became
accepted
in
the
caricatures
of
charles
darwin
with
an
ape
body
symbolized
evolution


the
idea
that
all
life
evolved
had
been
proposed
before
charles
darwin
published
on
the
origin
of
species


even
today
some
people
still
discuss
the
concept
of
evolution
and
what
it
means
to
them
their
philosophy
and
their
religion


evolution
does
seem
to
explain
some
things
about
about
our
human
nature


people
also
talk
about
the
social
implications
of
evolution


in
order
to
fit
in
the
idea
of
evolution
with
their
religious
views
people
have
come
up
with
ideas
like
guided
evolution
or
<collocation>theistic evolution</collocation>


they
say
that
evolution
is
real
but
is
being
guided
in
some
way


there
are
many
different
concepts
of
<collocation>theistic evolution</collocation>


many
creationists
believe
that
the
creation
myth
found
in
their
religion
goes
against
the
idea
of
evolution


as
darwin
realized
the
most
controversial
part
of
the
evolutionary
thought
is
what
it
means
for
human
origins


in
some
countries
especially
in
the
united
states
there
is
tension
between
people
who
accept
the
idea
of
evolution
and
those
who
do
not
accept
it


the
debate
is
mostly
about
whether
evolution
should
be
taught
in
schools
and
in
what
way
this
should
be
done


other
fields
like
cosmology
and
earth
science
also
do
not
match
with
the
original
writings
of
many
religious
texts


these
ideas
were
once
also
fiercely
opposed


death
for
heresy
was
threatened
to
those
who
wrote
against
the
idea
that
the
earth
was
the
center
of
the
universe


was
burnt
at
the
stake
by
the
holy
inquisition
for
teaching
that
the
earth
moved
around
the
sun
and
other
ideas


<collocation>evolutionary biology</collocation>
is
a
more
recent
idea


certain
religious
groups
oppose
the
idea
of
evolution
more
than
other
religious
groups
do


for
instance
the
roman
catholic
church
now
has
the
following
position
on
evolution
pope
pius
said
in
his
published
in
the
the
church
does
not
forbid
that
research
and
discussions


take
place
with
regard
to
the
doctrine
of
evolution
in
as
far
as
it
inquires
into
the
origin
of
the
human
body
as
coming
from
and
living
matter


pope
pius
pope
john
paul
ii
updated
this
position
in


he
said
that
evolution
was
more
than
a
hypothesis
in
his
my
predecessor
pius
has
already
said
that
there
is
no
conflict
between
evolution
and
the
doctrine
of
the
faith
regarding
man
and
his
vocation


today
more
than
a
after


that
some
new
findings
lead
us
toward
the
recognition
of
evolution
as
more
than
an
hypothesis


in
fact
it
is
remarkable
that
this
theory
has
had
progressively
greater
influence
on
the
spirit
of
researchers
following
a
series
of
discoveries
in
different
scholarly
disciplines


pope
john
paul
ii
speaking
to
the
academy
of
science
the
anglican
communion
also
does
not
oppose
the
scientific
account
of
evolution


using
evolution
for
other
purposes
many
of
those
who
accepted
evolution
were
not
much
interested
in
biology


they
were
interested
in
using
the
theory
to
support
their
own
ideas
on
society


racism
some
people
have
tried
to
use
evolution
to
support
racism


people
wanting
to
justify
racism
claimed
that
certain
groups
such
as
black
people
were
inferior


in
nature
some
animals
do
survive
better
than
others
and
it
does
lead
to
animals
better
adapted
to
their
circumstances


with
humans
groups
from
different
parts
of
the
world
all
evolution
can
say
is
that
each
group
is
probably
well
suited
to
its
original
situation


evolution
makes
no
judgements
about
better
or
worse


it
does
not
say
that
any
human
group
is
superior
to
any
other


eugenics
main
eugenics
this
amazing
idea
of
eugenics
was
rather
different


two
things
had
been
noticed
as
far
back
as
the
century


one
was
the
great
success
of
farmers
in
breeding
cattle
and
crop
plants


they
did
this
by
selecting
which
animals
or
plants
would
produce
the
next
generation
<collocation>artificial selection</collocation>


the
other
observation
was
that
lower
class
people
had
more
children
than
upper
class
people


if
and
it
a
big
if
the
higher
classes
were
there
on
merit
then
their
lack
of
children
was
the
exact
reverse
of
what
should
be
happening


faster
breeding
in
the
lower
classes
would
lead
to
the
society
getting
worse


the
idea
to
improve
the
human
species
by
selective
breeding
is
called
eugenics


the
name
was
proposed
by
francis
a
bright
scientist
who
meant
to
do
good


he
said
that
the
human
stock
gene
pool
should
be
improved
by
selective
breeding
policies


this
would
mean
that
those
who
were
considered
good
stock
would
receive
a
reward
if
they
reproduced


however
other
people
suggested
that
those
considered
bad
stock
would
need
to
undergo
compulsory
sterilization
<collocation>prenatal testing</collocation>
and
birth
control


the
german
nazi
government
used
eugenics
as
a
cover
for
their
extreme
racial
policies
with
<collocation>dreadful results</collocation>


the
problem
with
idea
is
how
to
decide
which
features
to
select


there
are
so
many
different
skills
people
could
have
you
could
not
agree
who
was
good
stock
and
who
was
bad
stock


there
was
rather
more
agreement
on
who
should
not
be
breeding


several
countries
passed
laws
for
the
compulsory
sterilisation
of
unwelcome
groups


most
of
these
laws
were
passed
between
and


after
<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii
disgust
at
what
the
nazis
had
done
squashed
any
more
attempts
at
eugenics


<collocation>algorithm design</collocation>
some
equations
can
be
solved
using
algorithms
that
simulate
evolution


evolutionary
algorithms
work
like
that


social
darwinism
another
example
of
using
ideas
about
evolution
to
support
social
action
is
social
darwinism


social
darwinism
is
a
term
given
to
the
ideas
of
the
century
social
philosopher
herbert
spencer


spencer
believed
the
survival
of
the
fittest
could
and
should
be
applied
to
commerce
and
human
societies
as
a
whole


again
some
people
used
these
ideas
to
claim
that
racism
and
<collocation>ruthless economic</collocation>
policies
were
justified


today
most
biologists
and
philosophers
say
that
the
theory
of
evolution
should
not
be
applied
to
social
policy


controversy
some
people
disagree
with
the
idea
of
evolution


they
disagree
with
it
for
a
number
of
reasons


most
often
these
reasons
are
influenced
by
or
based
on
their
<collocation>religious beliefs</collocation>


people
who
do
not
agree
with
evolution
usually
believe
in
creationism
or
intelligent
design


despite
this
evolution
is
one
of
the
most
successful
theories
in
science


people
have
discovered
it
to
be
useful
for
different
kinds
of
research


none
of
the
other
suggestions
explain
things
such
as
fossil
records
as
well


so
for
almost
all
scientists
evolution
is
not
in
doubt
