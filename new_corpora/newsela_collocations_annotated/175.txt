a

has
been

to
tell
how
different

elsewhere


early

by
about

they
had

this
was
the

homo

homo

the

most

at

did
not
live
in
one
place
but
moved
around
as
the

the

the

modern

around

in
many
different

and
population
humans
can
now
change
their

to
solve
problems


the
many
tall
buildings
in
<collocation>hong kong</collocation>
are
an
example
of
people
solving
the
problem
of
too
many
people
in

in
early
times
humans
usually
settled
near
to
water
and
other
natural
resources


in
modern
times
if
people
need
things
they
can
transport
them
from
somewhere
else


so
basing
a
settlement
close
to
resources
are
is
no
longer
as
important
as
it
once
was


since
the
number
of

most

the
rest

most

this
number
is

in

said
that
by

the

that

often
either

the
number
of

some

communicated
from
one
person
to
another
if
it
can
give
rise
to
no

and
no
theology


in
my
view
it
is
the
most
important
function
of
art
and
science
to
awaken
this
feeling
and
keep
it
alive
in
those
who
are

light
moves
at
the
speed

light
which
is
meters
or
about
miles
per
second


this
means
it
takes
about
minutes
for
light

the
sun


in

it
travels
at

light
moves
in

shadows

the
path
of
light
is

things

things
will
have
none
