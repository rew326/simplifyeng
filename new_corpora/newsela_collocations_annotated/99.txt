finding
homes
for
kittens
is
often
quite
difficult


if
a
tom
is
not
fixed
it
develops
a
disgusting
smell


breeders
who
have
<collocation>entire toms</collocation>
keep
them
in
a
special
hut
outside
the
house
for
that
reason


fixing
also
helps
to
avoid


means
that
there
are
too
many
cats
and
some
will
be
put
to
sleep
put
down
in
animal
pounds
animal
shelters


kittens
are
sometimes
born
with
defects


people
who
receive
cats
as
gifts
are
recommended
to
get
it
examined
for
its
health


some
birth
defects
like
heart
problems
require
urgent
<collocation>vet attention</collocation>


others
are
harmless
like
polydactyly


polydactyly
means
many
digits
or
many
fingers
from
poly
many
and
dactyl
digit


sometimes
there
is
a
mutation
change
in
cat
families


most
cats
have
only
four
to
five
toes
per
paw
depending
on
whether
it
is
the
front
or
back
paw


these
mutated
cats
have
six
seven
and
in
rare
cases
even
more


all
of
these
cats
are
called
cats


they
can
also
be
called
hemingway
cats
because
author
ernest

owned
many
of
these
cats


other
matters
where
to
find
more

communicating
with
a
microphone
communication
is
when
information
is
passed
from
a
sender
to
a
recipient
using
a
medium


there
are
different
media
that
can
be
used
visual
communication
using
body
language
or
gestures
communicating
with
sounds
like
human
language
but
may
also
be
the
barking
of
a
dog
communication
using
touch
using
smell
using
writing
communication
can
be
good
spoken
a
word
or
a
smile


communication
has
many
ways
and
happens
all
the
time


not
only
humans
communicate
most
other
animals
do
too


some
communication
is
done
without
thinking
such
as
by
changing
in
posture


another
form
of
communication
tries
to
change
somebody
mind


in
an
extreme
case
it
can
be
propaganda


this
is
similar
to
communication
by
talking
how
communication
works
communication
works
by
exchanging
information
or
messages


in
very
basic
terms
the
sender
makes
a
message
from
an
idea


this
is
usually
called
encoding
the
sender
transmits
the
message
through
the
medium


the
recipient
receives
the
message
and
it


besides
the
content
of
the
message
there
are
other
things
that
are
important


these
are
not
part
of
the
message
itself
but
rather
of
its
context
who
is
communicating
and
what
status
does
the
communicator
have


communication
messages
usually
do
not
come
alone
but
are
accompanied
by
other
messages


these
are
also
interpreted


for
a
message
exchange
to
be
successful
the
sender
and
the
recipient
must
have
agreed
on
a
vocabulary


the
word
hedge
can
mean
completely
different
things
based
on
the
context


in
biology
a
hedge
is
a
row
of
shrubs
or
trees
that
make
a
barrier
or
form
a
border


in
finance
a
hedge
is
an
investment
made
to
reduce
the
risk
of
another
investment


in
linguistics
a
hedge
is
a
word
or
set
of
words
that
make
other
words
less
important


without
any
information
it
is
therefore
very
difficult
to
know
which
hedge
is
really
meant
by
the
speaker

corrugated
cardboard


cardboard
is
a
heavy
type
of
paper
notable
for
its
stiffness
and
durability


it
was
first
invented
in
china
some
time
in
the
century
and
is
used
for
a
wide
variety
of
purposes


one
of
its
more

uses
is
as
a
packaging
material


<collocation>cardboard boxes</collocation>
were
first
produced
commercially
in
in
england


corrugated
also
called
pleated
paper
was
patented
in
england
in
used
as
a
liner
for
<collocation>tall hats</collocation>
but
corrugated
cardboard
would
not
be
patented
and
used
as
a
shipping
material
until
december


the
patent
was
issued
to
albert
jones
of
<collocation>new york</collocation>
city
<collocation>new york</collocation>
for
corrugated
cardboard


jones
used
the
corrugated
cardboard
for
wrapping
bottles
and
<collocation>glass lantern</collocation>
chimneys


the
first
machine
for
producing
large
quantities
of
corrugated
cardboard
was
built
in
by
smyth
and
in
the
same
year
oliver
long
improved
upon
jones
design
by
inventing
corrugated
cardboard
with
<collocation>liner sheets</collocation>
on
both
sides


this
was
now
cardboard
as
we

it
today


american

an
order
of
<collocation>seed bags</collocation>
a
metal
ruler
normally
used
to
crease
bags
shifted
in
position
and
cut
the
bag


discovered
that
by
cutting
and
cardboard
in
one
operation
he
could
make
prefabricated
cartons


extending
this
to
corrugated
cardboard
was
a
<collocation>straightforward development</collocation>
when
the
material
became
available


by
the
start
of
the
century
corrugated
<collocation>cardboard boxes</collocation>
began
replacing
the
wooden
crates
and
boxes
previously
used
for
trade


the
brothers
first
used
cardboard
cartons
to
hold
their
flaked
<collocation>corn cereal</collocation>
and
later
when
they
began
marketing
it
to
the
general
public
a
waxed
bag
of
was
wrapped
around
the
outside
of
the
box
and
printed
with
their
brand
name


this
marked
the
origin
of
the
cereal
box
though
in
modern
times
the
sealed
bag
is
plastic
and
is
kept
inside
the
box
rather
than
outside


cardboard
packaging
has
undergone
a
minor
resurgence
in
recent
times
due
to
the
trend
towards
environmentalism


it
is
now
common
for
cardboard
to
be
manufactured
with

ireland
and
the
isle
of
man
has
very
few
speakers


the
germanic
dialects
of
these
different
tribes
became
old
english


the
word
english
comes
from
the
name
of
the
angles


old
english
did
not
sound
or
look
much
like
the
english
we
speak
today


if
english
speakers
today
were
to
hear
or
read
a
passage
in
old
english
they
would
understand
just
a
few
words


the
closest
language
to
english
that
is
still
used
today
is
spoken
by
about
people
living
in
the
netherlands
germany
and
denmark


despite
its
similarity
to
english
speakers
of
the
two
languages
would
not
be
able
to
understand
each
other


however
a
few
people
suggest
that
the
closest
language
to
english
is
the
dutch
language


many
other
people
came
to
england
later
at
different
times
speaking
different
languages
and
these
languages
added
more
words
to
make
today
english


for
example
around
ad
many
danish
and
<collocation>norse pirates</collocation>
also
called
vikings
came
to
the
country
and
english
received
many
norse


their
languages
were
germanic
languages
like
old
english


after
william
the
conqueror
took
over
england
in
ad
with
his
armies
and
became
king
he
brought
his
nobles
who
spoke
norman
a
language
closely
related
to
french
to
be
the
new
government


they
stopped
english
from
being
taught
in
schools
for
a
long
time
and
the
language
changed
greatly
because
it
was
mostly
being
spoken
instead
of
written
for
about
years


english
borrowed
so
many
words
from
norman
at
that
time
that
it
could
be
called
a
different
language
middle
english


chaucer
is
a
well
known
writer
of
middle
english


after
more
sound
changes
middle
english
became
modern
english


although
the
works
of
shakespeare
might
seem
very
old
they
are
actually
called
modern


english
has
continued
to
take
new
words
from
other
languages
for
example
mainly
from
french
around
to
of
its
words
but
also
chinese
hindi
and
urdu
japanese
spanish
and
portuguese


because
many
scientists
from
different
countries
needed
to
talk
to
each
other
they
chose
names
for
scientific
things
in
the
languages
they
all
knew
greek
and
latin


those
words
came
to
english
also
for
example
photography
photo
means
light
and
graph
means
picture
or
writing
in
greek


a
photograph
is
a
picture
made
using
light
or
telephone


so
english
is
made
of
old
english
closely
related
to
german
and
dutch
danish
norse
and
french
and
has
been
changed
by
latin
greek
chinese
hindi
japanese
and
spanish
and
more
words
from
even
more
languages


the
history
of
the
british
empire
has
added
to
the
spread
of
the
english
language


english
is
an
important
language
in
many
places
today
like
in
australia
canada
<collocation>hong kong</collocation>
the
republic
of
india
and
pakistan
south
africa
and
the
united
states
english
is
the
main
language


because
the
<collocation>united kingdom</collocation>
the
country
where
england
is
and
the
united
states
have
historically
been
powerful
in
and
government
many
people
find
it
helpful
to
learn
english
to
communicate
in
science
business
and
diplomacy


this
is
called
learning
english
as
an
additional
language
english
as
a
second
language
or
english
as
a
foreign
language


many
famous
stories
and
plays
are
in
english


shakespeare
was
a
famous
english
writer
of
poems
and
plays


today
many
famous
songs
and
movies
cinema
films
use
the
english
language


spelling
differences
english
uses
strange
spelling
when
written


sounds
for
the
letters
and
combinations
look
the
same
but
can
be
very
different


for
example
ough
is
different
in
through
threw
rough
ruff
dough
doe
or
cough
coff


this
makes
it
a
very
hard
language
to
learn


many
english
speaking
countries
spell
words
differently


there
is
a
difference
between
some
spellings
in
america
on
the
one
hand
and
the
<collocation>united kingdom</collocation>
and
many
other
countries
such
as
those
of
the
british
commonwealth
where
english
is
the
main
language
on
the
other
hand


these
different
ways
of
spelling
are
sometimes
called
american
english
and
british
english


for
example
color
is
spelled
color
in
the
usa
and
program
is
spelled
program
in
the
usa


even
the
word
spelled
is
different
in
british
english
where
it
is
spelled
spelt


however
with
<collocation>greater globalization</collocation>
or
globalisation
or
spreading
around
the
world
and
the
spread
of
us
culture
through
television
and
us
computer
programs
some
british
people
now
sometimes
use
american
english
terms
