many

aquatic


they
may
live
on
both
land
and
in
water
and
in

prefer

these

distribution
and
habitats
despite
these
limitations
frogs
are
widespread
and
have
adapted
to
many
climates
even
deserts


they
rely
on
specific
adaptations
to
survive


members
of
the
genus
live
in
the
australian
central
desert


they
bury
themselves
underground
where
they
create
a
waterproof
cocoon
in
which
to
during
dry
periods


once
it
rains
they
come
out
find
a
temporary
pool
and
breed


egg
and
tadpole
development
is
very
fast
in
comparison
to
those
of
most
other
frogs
so
breeding
can
be
completed
before
the
pond
dries
up


some
frog
species
are
adapted
to
a
cold
environment


the
wood
frog
rana
whose
habitat
extends
into
the
arctic
circle
buries
itself
in
the
ground
during
winter


although
much
of
its
body
freezes
during
this
time
it
maintains
a
high
concentration
of
glucose
in
its
vital
organs
which
protects
them
from
damage


there
are
a
number
of
tiny
tree
frogs
which
develop
form
eggs
laid
in
water
pools
on
tropical
leaves
many
meters
above
the
ground


most
of
these
species
do
not
come
to

to

frogs
have
evolved
a

of
times
but
they
all
have
almost
<collocation>identical adaptations</collocation>


many
millions
of
years
of
<collocation>convergent evolution</collocation>
have
resulted
in
almost
identical
morphology
and

overall
frogs
are
a
successful
and
widespread
group


there
are
about
recorded
species
which
is
over
of

a
chemical
compound
is
a
chemical
formed
from
atoms
of
different
chemical
elements


the
different
atoms
are
joined
by
chemical
bonds


the
elements
stick
together
so
strongly
that
the
compound
behaves
like
one
substance


the
chemical
that
is
made
depends
upon
what
atoms
it
is
made
of
and
how
they
are
joined
together

they

we
get
compounds
from
natural
sources
such
as
plants
or
make
them
in
laboratories


compounds
can
be
made
from
others
by
scientists
and
these
are
called
synthetic

two
colorless
liquids
react
to
make
a

when
different

the

may
join
together
to
make

compound
or
change
into
several
new
compounds


chemists
are
people
who
study
compounds
and
find
new
ways
to
do
chemical
reactions


they
make
chemicals
in
order
to
find
new
ways
to
do
things
like
to
make
a
better
glue
or
to
make
new
medicines
or
to
make
things
clean
for
example


they
also
use
compounds
to
find
out
more
about
the
laws
of
chemistry


sometimes
people
use
the
word
chemical
just
to
talk
about
compounds
that
are
dangerous


many
chemical
compounds
can
be
dangerous
but
are
safe
if
they
are
used
the
right
way


we
all
use
chemicals
every
day
and
these
chemicals
have
to
be
tested
to
make
sure
they
are
safe


most
dangerous
chemicals
are
only
used
by
scientists
who
have
had
special
training
in
how
to
handle
and
use
them


these
chemicals
might
be

explosive
they
may
catch

easily
or
they
may
react

chemical
some
people
who
work
in
factories
are
near
chemicals
when
they
work
and
some
of
them
can
be
dangerous


those
people
should
do
special
things
to
make
sure
they
are
safe
and
sometimes
they
have
to
wear
special
clothes
that
stop
the
chemicals
from
hurting
their

after

the

housing
for

many
buildings
mostly
houses
have
been
made
of
wood


to
build
a
house
with
wood
lumber
is
put
together
into
frames
that
are
the
shape
of

floor

of
the
house


then
the
frames
are
placed
into

then
the
frames
can
be
covered

is
covered
in

the

chalk
is
a
type
of
limestone


air

water
do
not
wear
chalk
away
easily
so
when
chalk
is
next
to
the

it
often
makes
a

the
<collocation>white cliffs</collocation>

example
of
this


when
chalk
is
