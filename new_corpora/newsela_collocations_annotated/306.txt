he
was
a

brother
of
joseph
napoleon
and
and
the
older
brother
of
pauline
caroline
and


his
early
career
was
spent
in
the
army
and
he
served
with
napoleon
in
egypt


thanks
to
napoleon
he
was
a
general
by
the
age
of
although
he
himself
felt
that
he
had
risen
too
far
in
too
short
a
time


upon
his
return
to
france
he
was
involved
in
napoleon
plot
to
overthrow
the
directory


after
becoming
first
consul
napoleon
arranged
a
marriage
for
louis
to
de
the
daughter
of
empress
josephine
and
napoleon
stepdaughter


who
was
opposed
to
the
marriage
was
convinced
by
her
mother
to
marry
louis
for
the
sake
of
the
family


king
of
holland
three
days
after
a
devastating
explosion
of
a
powder
ship
on
january
in
the
dutch
town
of


napoleon
made
him
king
of
holland
on
june


he
took
his
duties
as
king
seriously
calling
himself
i
adopting
the
dutch
form
of
his
name


he
practiced
to
speak
dutch
language
and
tried
to
be
a
responsible
independent
ruler
of
holland


his
attempt
at
speaking
the
language
earned
him
some
respect
from
his
subjects


he
declared
that
he
was
dutch
and
renounced
his
french
citizenship


he
also
forced
his
court
and
ministers
mostly
supplied
by
napoleon
to
speak
only
dutch
languages


this
was
too
much
for
his
wife
who
refused
his
request


two
major
tragedies
occurred
during
his
reign
the
explosion
of
a
ship
filled
with
gunpowder
in
the
heart
of
the
city
of
in
and
a
major
flood
in


in
both
instances
louis
personally
and
effectively
oversaw
local
<collocation>relief efforts</collocation>
which
helped
earn
him
the
nickname
of
louis
the
good


his
reign
of
the
netherlands
was
short
lived
due
to
a
quarrel
with
his
brother


napoleon
i
wanted
dutch
troops
for
his
invasion
of
russia


louis
refused
napoleon
did
help
defend
the
kingdom
and
the
british
invaded


napoleon
then
suggested
that
louis
should
abdicate
but
he
refused


napoleon
removed
louis
from
the
dutch
throne
and
took
over
the
entire
kingdom
of
holland
on
july


after
his
kingdom
was
taken
from
him
louis
remained
in
holland
for
nearly
three
years
and
turned
to
writing
and
poetry


louis
wrote
to
napoleon
after
the
disastrous
russian
campaign
to
restore
him
to
the
dutch
throne


predictably
napoleon
refused
and
louis
returned
to
france
in


head
of
the
house
of
after
the
death
of
his
elder
brother
joseph
in
louis
was
seen
by
as
the
rightful
emperor
of
the
french
although
he
took
little
action
himself
to
advance
the
claim


his
son
and
heir
charles
on
the
other
hand
was
at
that
time
imprisoned
