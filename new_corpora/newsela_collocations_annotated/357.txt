a
wife
is
a
married
woman


married
means
that
the
law
says
two
people
are
legally
joined


during
the
marriage
ceremony
the
wife
is
called
the
bride


in
countries
and
times
it
has
been
different
how
many
wives
a
man
can
have
legally


in
old
times
there
were
no
limitations
in
some
countries


in
christianity
a
man
can
have
one
wife


in
islam
a
man
can
have
up
to
four
wives


there
are
some
names
for
special
kinds
of
wives


for
example
a
queen
is
a
wife
of
a
king


if
a
child
is
born
between
a
man
and
his
wife
this
child
is
thought
of
as
a
legitimate
lawful
child


in
contrast
a
child
between
a
man
and
a
woman
who
are
not
married
is
called
an
<collocation>illegitimate child</collocation>
or
a
bastard


however
children
born
out
of
wedlock
have
lost
a
social
stigma
in
many
western
countries
where
relationships
are
becoming
much
more
common


a
man
whose
wife
is
deceased
is
called
a
widower

also
spelled
katherine
or
katharine
was
an
english
woman
and
the
daughter
of
thomas
parr
of
kendal
a
<collocation>county squire</collocation>
who
had
distinguished
himself
in
the
service
of
both
king
henry
of
england
and
his
son
king
henry


at
the
age
of
fifteen
catherine
married
sir
edward
borough
but
he
died
shortly
afterwards
in
and
catherine
became
a
widow


her
second
husband
sir
john
lord
latimer
was
a
<collocation>rich landowner</collocation>
in
yorkshire
and
had
an
estate
there
called
<collocation>snape hall</collocation>


lord
latimer
died
in
leaving
catherine
as
a
widow
for
the
second
time
and
without
any
children


by
this
time
catherine
was
in
love
with
thomas
baron
of
and
was
about
to
marry
him
but
henry
himself
took
a
liking
to
catherine
as
well
and
no
doubt
influenced
by
their
acquaintance
she
married
henry
instead
on
july
in
court
palace


as
queen
consort
catherine
managed
to
bring
henry
daughters
elizabeth
and
mary
back
to
court


for
elizabeth
in
particular
catherine
was
a
mother
figure
and
friend
and
elizabeth
frequently
acknowledged
catherine
as
her
foremost
educational
mentor


catherine
was
a
good
wife
to
henry
but
her
strong
will
and
outspoken
nature
led
her
to
debate
topics
of
religion
a
little
too
openly
for
the
court
taste
and
henry
advisors
persuaded
him
that
catherine
was
attempting
to
subvert
his
religious
authority


as
a
result
in
catherine
found
an
arrest
warrant
for
her
signed
by
henry


catherine
managed
to
comfort
the
king
by
saying
that
she
only
argued
about
religion
to
take
his
mind
off
his
bad
leg
leading
henry
to
spare
her
life


on
january
henry
died


not
long
afterwards
catherine
was
married
to
thomas
and
soon
became
pregnant


she
gave
birth
to
their
daughter
mary
at
castle
on
august
but
she
did
not
recover
from
the
birth

environment
madagascar
is
home
to
many
species
that
were
not
known
about
until
around
when
dutch
explorers
went
there


they
do
not
even
exist
elsewhere
in
africa


they
only
exist
in
madagascar


in
fact
most
of
the
mammals
living
in
madagascar
do
not
live
anywhere
else
in
the
world


however
many
of
the
species
in
madagascar
are
in
danger
because
many
of
the
forests
have
been
cut
down


a
big
reason
that
forests
have
been
cut
down
is
so
that
land
can
be
used
to
grow
crops
such
as
coffee
which
is
one
of
the
most
important
crops
that
is
grown

france
took

early
life
vincent
van
was
born
in
holland


he
was
a
son
of
a
pastor
and
was
brought
up
in
a
religious
family


vincent
was
very
emotional
and
he
did
not
have
enough

between
and
when
he
finally
decided
to
become
an
artist
van
had
had
two
<collocation>sad romances</collocation>


he
also
had
worked
unsuccessfully
in
a
bookstore
as
an
art
salesman
and
a
preacher


he
remained
in
belgium
where
he
had
preached
to
study
art


the
works
of
his
early
dutch
period
are
sad
sharp
and
one
of
the
most
famous
pictures
from
here
is
the
potato
eaters
painted
in


in
that
year
van
went
to
antwerp
where
he
found
the
works
of
rubens
and
bought
a
lot
of
japanese
prints


in
he
went
to
paris
to
join
his
brother
who
was
the
manager
of
gallery


in
paris
van
studied
with


he
also
met
and


this
helped
the
colors
of
his
paintings
lighten
and
be
painted
in
short
strokes
from
the
paintbrush


his
nervous
temper
made
him
a
difficult
companion
and
discussions
combined
with
painting
all
day
made
him
very
unhealthy


he
decided
to
go
south
to
arles
where
he
hoped
his
friends
would
join
him
and
help
found
a
school
of
art


did
join
him
but
it
did
not
help


near
the
end
of
left
arles


van
followed
him
with
an
open
razor
but
was
stopped
by


instead
he
cut
his
own
<collocation>ear lobe</collocation>
off


after
that
van
began
to
get
fits
of
madness
and
was
sent
to
the
asylum

died
two
days
later
with
at
his
side
who
reported
his
last
words
as
la
which
meant
the
sadness
will
last
forever
in
french

during
his
brief
career
he
had
only
sold
one
painting


van
finest
works
were
all

less
than
three
years


van
mother
threw
away
a
lot
of
his
paintings

his
life
and

death


but
she
lived
long
enough

see
him
become
a
world
famous
painter


he
was
not
well
known
when

was
alive

did
not
appreciate
his
art


after

became
very
famous

is
one
of
the
<collocation>greatest painters</collocation>
