a
clause
is
a
part
of
a
sentence


each
clause
has
only
one
main
verb


i
love
you
is
a
sentence
which
has
only
one
clause


i
love
you
and
i
will
always
love
you
is
a
sentence
which
has
two
clauses


the
two
clauses
are
i
love
you
and
i
will
always
love
you


these
clauses
are
joined
together
by
the
word
and
a
conjunction


two
clauses
can
be
joined
with
a
pronoun


for
example
i
live
in
london
which
is
in
england


here
i
live
in
london
is
the
first
clause
and
which
is
in
england
is
the
second
clause


the
word
which
is
a
pronoun
which
takes
the

marxism
is
the
name
for
a
set
of
political
and
economic
ideas


the
base
of
these
ideas
comes
from
the
works
of
marx
and


they
have
had
a
lot
of
influence
in
many
countries


very
often
both
authors
are
named
as
it
is
difficult
to
say
which
of
the
two
wrote
what
piece
of
the
theory


marxism
influenced
other
political
views
such
as
social
democracy
and
reformist
socialism
both
believe
that
the
ideas
that
marx
and
portrayed
can
be
achieved
through
what
marx
called
<collocation>bourgeois democracy</collocation>


many
marxists
say
that
modern
communism
is
not
communism
at
all


that
nations
such
as
ussr
the
people
republic
of
china
cuba
and
vietnam
are
different
forms
of
capitalism
often
with
heavily
nationalized
industries


one
of
the
<collocation>biggest proponents</collocation>
of
these
ideas
in
marxist
thought
was
tony
cliff
who
wrote
that
states
like
the
and
communist
china
before
were


not
all
communists
socialists
or
marxists
agree
on
this
question
but
many
hardened
marxists
generally
agree
that
socialism
is
workers
democratic
control
over
economic
decisions
and
social
justice
while
production
is
based
on
what
people
need
and
that
socialism
will
wither
away
into
communism
when
capitalism
is
defeated


with
that
idea
in
mind
marxists
have
a
tendency
to
discredit
most
of
the
listed
regimes


modern
communism
claims
to
be
based
on
marxist
ideas
but
many
marxists
disagree
about
whether
communist
countries
have
understood
marxism
correctly


the
working
class
and
the
<collocation>capitalist class</collocation>
marxism
says
that
people
in
the
world
are
organized
into
different
groups
or
classes
based
on
their
relationship
to
how
things
are
made


most
people
are
called
workers
because
they
work
in
factories
or
offices
or
farms
for
money


they
belong
to
the
working
class
or
proletariat


another
group
who
are
not
as
big
as
the
working
class
are
capitalists
because
they
own
the
factories
land
and
buildings
that
the
workers
have
to
work
in
and
also
own
all
of
the
tools
the
workers
have
to
use


marx
<collocation>calls capitalists</collocation>
the
ruling
class
because
they
live
off
of
the
work
of
all
the
workers


he
also
says
that
the
capitalists
own
the
government
army
and
courts


in
marxist
views
capital
is
the
means
of
production
and
money
which
the
capitalist
can
invest
in
different
places
of
business
so
that
they
can
profit
or
gain
more
capital


most
workers
work
for
companies
owned
by
capitalists
or
small
business
owners


the
capitalist
pays
a
wage
to
the
worker
in
exchange
for
the
worker
time


the
capitalist
has
bought
a
period
of
time
from
the
worker
which
the
worker
must
then
use
to
labor
for
the
capitalist
which
according
to
<collocation>marxist economic</collocation>
thinking
is
the
only
thing
that
can
create
value
in
a
commodity
and
then
exploits
the
time
of
the
worker
as
much
as
they
can


the
capitalist
amasses
capital
by
paying
the
worker
less
wealth
than
they
make
for
the
capitalist


marx
says
that
commodities
pieces
of
merchandise
have
a
twofold
nature


on
the
one
hand
they
are


means
they
are
useful
that
is
they
have
the
capacity
of
satisfying
a
human
need


on
the
other
hand
they
are
because
someone
could
trade
a
quantity
of
them
for
a
determined
quantity
of
another
commodity


for
example
if
a
nail
is
traded
for
bootlaces
the
exchange
value
of
a
single
nail
is
bootlaces


finally
labor
value
or
value
is
determined
by
the
amount
of
labor
needed
to
create
a
product


value
is
created
by
adding
work
to
something


a
product
value
is
determined
by
the
average
work
needed
to
create
the
product
for
the
market


value
can
be
described
as
the
amount
of
labor
time
used
to
create
a
commodity


as
an
example
peter
and
bob
and
carl
are
all
<collocation>shoe makers</collocation>


it
takes
peter
half
a
day
to
make
shoes
and
it
takes
bob
half
a
day
to
make
shoes
and
it
takes
carl
half
a
day
to
make
shoes


the
average
to
make
the
shoes
is
half
a
day
and
that
means
each
shoe
contains
half
a
day
labor
value


peter
bob
and
carl
now
work
for
james


james
owns
a
shoe
factory
that
can
make
shoes
in
half
a
day


between
peter
bob
and
carl
shoes
are
made


peter
bob
and
carl
are
paid
only
as
much
as
they
need
to
live
at
socially
accepted
standards


peter
bob
and
carl
each
get
dollars
a
day
in
wages
however
james
sells
the
shoes
for
dollars
each


is
made
and
james
pays
the
workers
peter
bob
and
carl
their
wages


the
remaining
wealth
is
called
profit
or
surplus
value


in
other
words
peter
bob
and
carl
earn
enough
to
provide
for
themselves
within
half
of
their
working
day


the
rest
of
the
day
they
are
creating
profit
for
their
boss
james
which
is
called
surplus
value


it
is
this
surplus
value
or
profit
which
marxism
thinks
as
an
exploitation
of
labor


this
exploitation
allows
the
smaller
class
capitalists
to
live
without
laboring
while
the
bigger
class
workers
have
to
work
for
the
capitalists
to
survive


marxism
says
that
factories
tools
and
work
places
can
not
create
new
value
on
their
own


similar
to
how
a
blueberry
bush
has
no
value
on
its
own


that
value
can
only
be
created
with
the
use
of
labor


for
example
someone
spends
a
day
picking
blueberries


those
blueberries
are
now
able
to
be
traded
or
eaten
because
of
the
invested
labor
time
to
pick
them


marxist
thinking
claims
that
capitalists
and
workers
are
in
a
constant
state
of
struggle
which
they
call
materialist
dialectic


marxism
says
that
in
order
for
capitalists
to
generate
profit
quickly
and
to
maximize
their
rate
of
profit
they
have
to
exploit
the
workers
as
much
as
possible
and
lower
their
wages
as
much
as
possible


workers
on
the
other
hand
have
to
struggle
to
keep
their
wages
up
to
keep
the
rate
of
exploitation
low
so
that
they
can
live
more
peaceful
lives


this
is
what
marxism
calls
<collocation>class struggle</collocation>
where
workers
and
their
bosses
fight
against
each
other
to
gain
for
themselves


marxists
think
that
all
of
written
human
history
has
been
divided
by
economic
classes


they
think
that
the
progression
of
history
has
been
pushed
forward
by
<collocation>class struggle</collocation>


marxism
says
that
it
is
from
this
struggle
that
capitalism
was
born
and
that
it
is
from
this
struggle
that
communism
or
socialism
will
be
born


for
example
<collocation>feudal society</collocation>
a
society
controlled
by
<collocation>feudal lords</collocation>
and
nobles
rested
its
ruling
class
on
the
labor
of
peasants
farmers


but
as
peasants
demanded
more
and
more
for
themselves
small
shopkeepers
and
tradespeople
began
to
appear


many
of
these
people
appeared
in
guilds
as
well
and
eventually
began
to
employ
workers
to
independently
accumulate
wealth


it
was
this
historical
progression
that
created


in
the
same
way
marxism
says
that
capitalism
will
give
way
to
communism
as
the
struggle
of
the
workers
becomes
more
and
more
revolutionary


materialism
the
core
of
marxist
thinking
is
called
materialism


materialism
is
a
philosophical
view
that
says
that
communities
develop
from
the
ground
up
that
the
higher
qualities
of
culture
art
manners
customs
religions
are
actually
founded
on
the
lower
or
simpler
qualities
of
life
abundance
of
resources
like
food
and
shelter
who
has
money
and
what
they
have
to
do
to
get
it
who
is
allowed
to
work
and
who
is
forced
to
work


changes
in
the
higher
qualities
of
culture
sometimes
called
the
superstructure
are
often
linked
to
changes
in
the
lower
qualities
of
life
sometimes
called
the
base


one
example
is
that
in
the
medieval
period
honor
or
duty
to
one
superiors
was
seen
as
very
important
today
in
western
countries
ambition
or
being
someone
who
works
hard
for
their
own
goals
is
seen
as
more
important
this
is
because
in
the
medieval
period
people
worked
their
entire
lives
under
lords
who
depended
on
them
not
only
for
work
but
for
war
today
people
work
on
a
more
individual
basis
and
our
society
operates
by
letting
some
people
move
up
from
being
poor
to
rich
though
this
is
still
very
hard


in
this
case
what
is
seen
as
good
depends
on
how
the
rulers
get
value
out
of
their
workers


marxism
recognizes
that
in
earlier
time
periods
we
lived
first
under
rulers
who
owned
everything
then
we
lived
under
lords
who
owned
land
with
workers
who
lived
on
them
and
that
we
currently
live
under
governments
that
allow
many
people
to
own
property
though
still
organized
in
a
way
that
robs
many
people
of
their
labor
and
rights


eventually
marxists
believe
that
we
will
move
to
a
society
where
everyone
owns
everything
in
common
this
will
be
known
as
socialism


in
other
words
human
progression
has
been
based
on
genetic
evolution
and
social
evolution
that
human
society
has
always
been
based
on
the
economic
forces
that
human
beings
can
control


for
marxism
this
means
that
the
mode
of
production
dictates
the
form
each
society
will
take


it
is
this
idea
that
brings
marxists
to
believe
that
the
current
capacity
to
produce
means
human
beings
can
move
beyond
the
conflicts
of
class
society


a
dialectic
is
an
argument
or
conflict
between
different
groups


the
different
groups
or
classes
have
their
own
interests
and
needs


dialectical
materialism
is
the
idea
that
the
history
of
humans
is
the
history
of
conflict
between
classes


different
classes
with
different
interests
argue
or
fight
each
other


social
change
is
the
result


many
marxists
believe
that
there
will
always
be
revolts
and
with
the
right
conditions
revolutions


in
these
revolutions
the
workers
will
fight
the
capitalists
and
will
eventually
win


during
this
process
they
will
set
up
a
socialist
workers
state
a
form
of
government
that
is
the
workers
themselves
organised
as
the
rulers
of
society
that
will
serve
as
a
temporary
state
the
state
marxists
believe
is
an
organization
of
one
class
to
suppress
another
class
the
socialist
state
is
created
to
suppress
the
<collocation>capitalist class</collocation>
or
what
they
call
the
exploiting
class
until
all
capitalist
countries
have
been
defeated
and
all
classes
have
been
abolished


marxists
believe
that
if
the
working
class
makes
itself
the
ruling
class
and
destroys
the
objective
basis
for
class
society
private
property
or
what
marx
called
bourgeois
property
relations
there
will
be
a
<collocation>classless society</collocation>
a
society
where
no
social
groups
are
in
conflict
and
there
is
no
government
anymore
and
the
state
will
be
dismantled
organically
and
it
will
be
a
world
with
communes
and
of
production
based
on
needs
instead
of
profits

is
an
economic
and
governmental
system
where
the

and

companies


its
goal
is
to
have
the
industries
make
money
which
can
be
used
for
the
benefit
of
everyone


it

to
give

control

their


social
democracy
is
a
form
of
socialism
that
tries
to
mix
parts
of
communism
with
capitalism


in
this
system
the
government
wealth
from
the
rich
to
the
poor
like
a
communist
state
but
people
can
also
run
their
own
businesses
and
own
private
property
like
a
capitalist
state


unlike
communism
it
is
public
money
raised
from
taxes
being
redistributed
to
the
poor
rather
than
private
property
eg


seizing
all
funds
over
million
to
give
to
everyone


it
supports
gradual
reform
over
revolution


much

the

collectively
as
a
group
contribute
money
or
other
goods
for
the
benefit
of
the
entire
community


an
example
of
this
would
be
the
fire
departments


they
rely
on
taxes
paid
by
the
people
to
keep
equipment
and
staff
for
the
benefit
of
the
community
should
something
catch
on
fire


some
of
these
countries
use
a
progressive
tax
where
richer
people
are
taxed
more
than
poorer
people


this
tax
and
other
measures
helps
to
reduce
the
inequality
between
rich
and
poor
in
a
nation


in
many
countries
that
practice
social
democracy
specific
services
and
some
industries
are
subsidized
partially
controlled
by
the
government
