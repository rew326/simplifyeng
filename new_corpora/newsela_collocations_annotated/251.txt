william
iii
started
a
new
war
but
lost
at


he
gave
more
land
to
france
at
the
treaty
of


in
prussia
again
started
war
with
france


in
prussia
won
her
lost
land
again
and
also
all
the
and
westphalia
and
some
other
land


this
land
in
the
west
was
very
important
especially
the
valley


it
was
the
new
center
of
germany
and
the
home
of
the
weapons
industry


after
the
wars
prussia
was
the
biggest
power
in
germany
and
more
powerful
than
austria


in
the
early
century
the
liberals
in
germany
wanted
one
federal
democratic
germany


the
conservatives
wanted
germany
as
a
group
of
independent
weak
states


in
revolution
came
to
europe
the
liberals
had
a
chance


frederick
william
iv
was
worried


he
allowed
a
national
assembly
and
a
constitution


the
new
frankfurt
parliament
wanted
to
give
frederick
william
the
crown
of
all
germany
but
he
did
not
want
it


he
said
that
revolutionaries
could
not
name
kings


now
prussia
had
a
constitution
but
really
the
nobility
with
land
the
junkers
had
the
power
especially
in
the
east


imperial
prussia
prussia
in
the
german
empire
in
prussian
king
william
i
named
otto
von
bismarck
as
the
new
<collocation>prime minister</collocation>


bismarck
wanted
the
liberals
and
the
conservatives
to
lose


he
wanted
to
create
a
strong
united
germany
but
under
the
junker
not
under
the
western
german
liberals


so
he
started
three
wars
with
denmark
in
this
gave
prussia
with
austria
in
war
this
allowed
prussia
to
take
hanover
and
most
other
north
german
territories
who
were
with
austria
with
france
in
war
so
bismarck
could
control
and
saxony


after
this
these
states
but
not
austria
became
part
of
a
united
german
empire
and
william
i
took
the
title
of
emperor
kaiser


this
was
prussia
high
moment


the
economic
and
political
future
looked
good
if
the
leaders
were
clever


but
after
days
in
the
state
had
a
new
leader
william
ii


he
had
little
experience
and
little
imagination
and
he
made
bad
plans


bismarck
lost
his
job
in
and
william
ii
started
a
new
foreign
policy


he
started
a
military
program
and
took
risks
this
took
germany
into
<collocation>world war</collocation>
i


the
<collocation>prussian junker</collocation>
controlled
the
war
so
when
they
lost
it
was
the
end
for
them


the
prussian
king
and
all
the
other
german
kings
lost
their
power


germany
became
a
republic


in
the
treaty
of
versailles
the
polish
state
and
prussia
had
to
return
a
lot
of
land


the
polish
corridor
was
between
east
prussia
and
germany


the
end
of
prussia
prussia
at
the
end
of
<collocation>world war</collocation>
i
some
people
wanted
to
break
prussia
into
smaller
states


but
tradition
won
and
prussia
became
the
prussian
free
state
the
largest
state
of
the
republic
with
of
its
land


the
industrial
area
was
in
prussia
and
also
berlin
so
prussia
was
the
home
of
the
left


the
<collocation>social democrats</collocation>
and
the
catholic
centre
had
power
for
most
of
the


in
germany
conservative
chancellor
franz
von
took
control
of
prussia
ending
the
state
democratic
constitution


it
was
the
end
of
german
democracy
too


in
became
interior
minister
of
prussia
he
was
now
very
strong


in
the
nazis
took
the
german
states
power


in
the
soviet
union
army
took
all
of
eastern
and
central
germany
and
berlin


poland
took
everything
east
of
the
line
silesia
eastern
and
east
prussia


the
soviet
union
took
the
northern
third
of
east
prussia
including
now


about
ten
million
germans
had
to
fly
from
these
areas


polish
and
russian
people
moved
there
to
fill
the
area


because
of
this
and
because
the
communists
took
control
of
land
in
the
the
junker
and
prussia
were
finished


in
the
united
states
britain
france
and
the
soviet
union
formally
agreed
the
end
of
prussia


in
the
soviet
zone
from
the
the
prussian
lands
were
now
the
states
of
and


the
prussian
parts
of
went
to


in
the
government
stopped
using
states
and
used
districts


in
the
end
of
the
the
states
returned


in
the
west
from
the
federal
republic
of
germany
the
prussian
lands
went
to
north
<collocation>lower saxony</collocation>
and


took
the
land


the
idea
of
prussia
is
not
completely
dead
in
germany


today
some
people
want
to
put
together
the
states
of
and
berlin
and
call
them
prussia


but
german
politicians
are
not
interested
in
the
idea


the
constitution
of
berlin
allows
for
berlin
and
becoming
one
state
but
the
people
of
berlin
said
no
in

vote

the
apocrypha
are
religious
texts
that
are
in
some
versions
of
the
bible


other
versions
omit
them


the
word
comes
from
ancient
greek
lang


apocrypha
means
those
that
were
hidden


generally
the
term
is
applied
to
writings
that
were
not
part
of
the
canon


there
are
several
reasons
why
these
texts
were
not
included
in
the
canon


the
texts
might
only
have
been
known
to
few
people
or
they
might
have
been
left
out
because
their
content
does
not
fit
well
into
that
of
the
other
books
of
the
bible


some
of
the
apocrypha
were
written
at
a
later
date
and
were
therefore
not
included


the
authorized
king
james
version
called
these
books
apocrypha


it
separated
them
because
the
bible
said
so
in
but
keep
the
seventy
last
that
thou
mayest
deliver
them
only
to
such
as
be
wise
among
the
people
for
in
them
is
the
spring
of
understanding
the
fountain
of
wisdom
and
the
stream
of
knowledge


roman
catholic
bibles
have
these
books
in
the
<collocation>old testament</collocation>


they
do
not
call
them
apocrypha


they
call
them
which
means
that
they
belong
to
the
second
canon


canon
just
means
an
official
list
of
literary
works
accepted
as
representing
a
field


the
first
list
is
of
books
first
written
in
hebrew


this
second
list
is
of
books
first
written
in
greek


some
say
these
books
were
kept
in
catholic
bibles
because
it
is
believed
that
the
bible
jesus
read
was
a
bible
that
included
the
books
of
the
apocrypha
the
books


it
is
known
that
the
most
popular
bible
at
the
time
of
jesus
was
the
greek
septuagint
version
which
includes
these
extra
books


that
is
why
early
church
fathers
quoted
from
bibles
including
these
books


others
say
christians
disagree
about
the
apocrypha


others
point
out
that
the
apocrypha
was
in
every
christian
bible
until


in
these
books
were
taken
out
of
some
bibles


the
translators
of
the
king
james
bible
said
that
these
books
were
written
to
prepare
the
people
for
jesus
in
the
same
way
as
john
the
baptist
did


they
said
that
the
apostles
used
these
books


and
modern
day
mormons
also
have
hints
in
the
book
of
mormon


there
is
no
question
that
these
books
have
always
been
part
of
the
bible
in
<collocation>oriental orthodox</collocation>
churches
so
they
were
definitely
not
added
in
the


around
the
year
ad
the
jewish
council
sanhedrin
decided
to
cut
the
books
from
the
hebrew
bible
but
they
stayed
in
the
christian
bible


then
soon
after
christianity
became
the
only
religion
of
roman
empire
in
the
century
the
romans
decided
to
cut
out
all
of
the
same
books
that
the
sanhedrin
had
cut
out
and
they
moved
some
of
them
to
the
apocrypha


texts
of
the
apocrypha
books
of
the

be

sodium
is
a
light
metal


sodium
is
so
soft
that
it
can
be
easily
cut
with
a
knife


when
it
is
cut
the
surface
will
become
white
after
a
bit
of
time


this
is
because
it
reacts
with
air
to
form
<collocation>sodium hydroxide</collocation>
and
<collocation>sodium carbonate</collocation>


sodium
is
a
little
lighter
than
water
when
it
reacts
with
water
it
floats


this
reaction
is
very
fast


hydrogen
and
<collocation>sodium hydroxide</collocation>
are
produced


the
hydrogen
may
ignite


since
sodium
melts
at
a
low
temperature
it
melts
when
it
reacts
with
water


it
has
one
electron
which
is
removed
easily

it
highly
reactive

done
such
as
moving

a
random
number
of
places
on

most
dice
are
cubes
that
have
the
numbers
and
on
the
faces


dice
are
sometimes
made
in
other
shapes
than
cubes
but
the
die
die
is
the
singular
of
dice
is
the
most
common


a
die
is
usually
rolled
by
the
player
hand


when
calculating
together
opposite
sides
of
typical
dice
result
is
always


some
games
are
played
with
two
dice
and
some
use
only
one


some
games
that
use
dice
are
monopoly
risk
dungeons
and
dragons
and
many
more


dice
with

are
called

specific
entries
of
a
matrix
are
often
referenced
by
using
pairs
of
for
the
numbers
at
each
of
the
rows
columns


in
mathematics
a
matrix
plural
matrices
is
a
rectangular
table
of
cells
of
numbers
with
rows
and
columns


the
rows
are
each
horizontal
lines
and
the
columns
go
vertical


the
cell
is
at
row
column
see
diagram
at
right


there
are
rules
for
adding
subtracting
and
multiplying
matrices
together
but
the
rules
are
different
than
for
numbers


as
an
example
a
b
does
not
always
give
the
same
result
as
b
a
which
is
the
case
for
the
multiplication
of
ordinary
numbers


a
matrix
can
have
more
than
dimensions
such
as
a
matrix


also
a
matrix
can
be
as
a
single
row
or
column


many
natural
sciences
use
matrices
quite
a
lot


in
many
universities
courses
about
matrices
usually
called
linear
algebra
are
taught
very
early

the
horizontal
lines
in
a
matrix
are
called
rows
and
the
vertical
lines
are
called
columns


a
matrix
with
m
rows
and
n
columns
is
called
an
m
by
n
matrix
or
m
n
matrix
and
m
and
n
are
called
its
dimensions


the
places
in
the
matrix
where
the
numbers
are
called
entries


the
entry
of
a
matrix
a
that
lies
in
the
row
number
i
and
column
number
j
is
called
the
i

matrix
a
with
each
entry
in
the
matrix
called
a

for
all
i
m
and

this
matrix
has
m
rows
and
n
columns

operations
addition
the
sum
of
two
matrices
is
the

the
result
of
the
multiplication
called
the
product
is
another
matrix
with
the

number
of
rows
as
the
first
matrix
and
the

identity
every
square
dimension
set
of
a
matrix
has
a
special
counterpart
called
an
<collocation>identity matrix</collocation>


the
<collocation>identity matrix</collocation>
has
nothing
but
zeroes
except
on
the
main
diagonal
where
there
are
all
ones


there
is
exactly
one
<collocation>identity matrix</collocation>
for
each
square
dimension
set


an
<collocation>identity matrix</collocation>
is
special
because
when
multiplying
any
matrix
by
the
<collocation>identity matrix</collocation>
the
result
is
always
the
original
matrix
with
no
change


inverse
matrix
an
inverse
matrix
is
a
matrix
that
when
multiplied
by
another
matrix
equals
the
<collocation>identity matrix</collocation>


one
column
matrix
a
matrix
that
has
many
rows
but
only
one
column
is
called
a
column
vector


determinants
the
takes
a
square
matrix
and
returns
a
number


to
understand
what
the
number
means
take
each
column
of
the
matrix
and
draw
it
as
a
vector


the
parallelogram
drawn
by
those
vectors
has
an

there
are
no
simple
formulas
for
the
determinants
of
larger
matrices
and
many
computer
programmers
study
how
to
get
computers
to
quickly
find
large
determinants


properties
of
determinants
there
are
three
rules
that
all
determinants
follow


these
are
the
of
an
<collocation>identity matrix</collocation>
is
if
two
rows
or
two
columns
of
the
matrix
are
exchanged
then
the
is
multiplied
by


mathematicians
call
this
alternating


if
all
the
numbers
in
one
row
or
column
are
multiplied
by
another
number
n
then
the
is
multiplied
by
n


also
if
a
matrix
m
has
a
column
v
that
is
the
sum
of
two
column
matrices
and
then
the
of
m
is
the
sum
of
the
determinants
of
m
with
in
place
of
v
and
m
with
in

the
british

are
an

a
group
of
islands
in

history

the

the

is
home

some
people
include
the

sark
in
the
term
british

but
they
are
a
lot
closer
to
france
than
to
great

in
politics
they
are
british
islands
but
in
geology
they
are
french

the
term
tends
not
to
be
used
in
the

because
many

feel
it
implies

mandarin
is
one
of
five
major
regional
languages
of
china


it
<collocation>spreads wider</collocation>
than
any
other
regional
language
from
the
whole
northern
part
of
china
down
to
province
in
the
southwest
corner
of
china


in
that
big
area
there
are
many
regional
differences
in
vocabulary
so
somebody
who
moves
from
to
could
not
understand
people
there
who
were
speaking
their
own
language


the
problem
is
bigger
than
for
a
person
in
great
britain
or
the
united
states
to
go
to
australia


therefore
starting
in
the
the
chinese
government
set
up
a
national
language
based
on
the
most
widely
understood
words
and
pronunciations


mandarin
is
a
standard
language


it
is
nobody
native
language
but
a
good
average
between
various
language
forms
and
a
common
language
everyone
can
understand
and
communicate
with


it
is
based
on
the
dialect
but
it
is
not
the
same
as
dialect
