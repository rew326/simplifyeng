between
and

implicit
and
explicit
<collocation>atheism atheism</collocation>
has
sometimes
been
defined
to
include
the
simple
absence
of
belief
that
any
deities
exist


this
definition
is
very
general
and
includes
people
who
have
never
heard
about
theistic
ideas


in
baron
said
that
all
children
are
born
atheists
they
have
no
idea
of
god


george
smith
in
said
that
the
man
who
is
unacquainted
with
is
an
atheist
because
he
does
not
believe
in
a
god


this
category
would
also
include
the
child
who
is
able
to
grasp
the
issues
involved
but
who
is
still
unaware
of
those
issues


the
fact
that
this
child
does

qualifies
him
as
an
atheist

michael

have
looked

sometimes

against
weak
sometimes
called
negative
atheism


strong
atheism
is
the
certain
belief
that
no
god
exists


<collocation>weak atheism</collocation>
is
all
other
forms
of
not
believing
in
a
god
or
gods


according
to
this
idea
anyone
who
does
not
believe
in

is
either
a
weak
or
a
strong
atheist


the
terms
weak
and
strong
are
very
new
the
terms
negative
and
positive
are
older


they
have
been
used
more
in

under

<collocation>weak atheism</collocation>


most
disagree
they
think
their
view
is
different
from
atheism


in
their
view
atheism
is
no
different
from
believing
in

god
because
both
require
belief


say
that
it
can
not
be
known
if
a
god
or
gods
exist


in
their
view
strong
atheism
requires
a
leap
of
faith


the
mathematician
wrote
an
essay
called
the
ethics
of
belief


in
this
essay
shows
some
examples
how
people
can
believe
in
things
which
go
against
what
they
see
or
feel


one
of
these
examples
is
a
story
of
a
ship
captain
who
<collocation>transports immigrants</collocation>


the
immigrants
have
to
pay
to
be
able
to
go
on
the
ship


the
ship
is
old
and
in
a
bad
state
it
needs
to
be
fixed
badly


at
first
the
captain
thought
about
fixing
the
ship
even
though
that
this
would
cost
a
lot
of
money


before
the
ship
sails
he
can
forget
about
his
worry
by
telling
himself
that
the
ship
has
safely
made
many
trips
and
survived
many
storms
before
so
it
would
also
be
good
for
this
trip
so
his
fear
is
not
necessary


unfortunately
the
ship
sinks
and
all
die


the
is
greedy
and
takes
the
money
the
insurance
pays
for
the
ship


according
to
the
captain
did
something
that
is
wrong
when
he
made
himself
believe
there
were
no
problems
with
the
ship
he
did
this
because
he
is
greedy


even
if
the
ship
had
made
its
trip
safely
the
captain
would
have
done
something
that
is
wrong


according
to
it
is
always
wrong
to
believe
something
without
enough
reasons


atheists
usually
respond
by
saying
that
there
is
no
difference
between
a
idea
about
religion
with
no
proof
and
one
about
other
things
and
that
the
lack
of
proof
that
gods
do
not
exist
does
not
mean
that
any
do
any
more
than
it
means
that
any
do
not


scottish
philosopher
smart
says
that
sometimes
a
person
who
is
really
an
atheist
may
describe
herself
even
passionately
as
an
agnostic
because
of
unreasonable
<collocation>philosophical skepticism</collocation>
which
would
preclude
us
from
saying
that
we
know
anything
whatever
except
perhaps
the
truths
of
mathematics
and
formal
logic


so
some
popular
atheist
authors
such
as
richard
like
to
show
the
difference
between
agnostic
and
atheist
positions
by
the
probability
assigned
to
the
statement
god
exists


atheism
in
daily
life
in
everyday
life
many
people
define
natural
phenomena
without
the
need
of
a
god
or
gods


they
do
not
deny
the
existence
of
one
or
more
gods
they
simply
say
that
this
existence
is
not
necessary


gods
do
not
provide
a
purpose
to
life
nor
influence
it
according
to
this
view


many
scientists
practice
what
they
<collocation>call methodological</collocation>


they
silently
adopt
philosophical
and
use
the
scientific
method


their
belief
in
a
god
does
not
affect
their
results


<collocation>practical atheism</collocation>
can
take
different
forms
absence
of
religious
motivation
belief
in
gods
does
not
motivate
moral
action
religious
action
or
any
other
form
of
action
active
exclusion
of
the
problem
of
gods
and
religion
from
<collocation>intellectual pursuit</collocation>
and
practical
action
indifference
the
absence
of
any
interest
in
the
problems
of
gods
and
religion
or
of
the
concept
of
a
deity


<collocation>theoretical atheism</collocation>
theoretic
atheism
tries
to
find
arguments
against
the
existence
of
god
and
to
disprove
the
arguments
of
such
as
the
argument
from
design
or
pascal
wager


these
theoretical
reasons
have
many
forms
most
of
them
are
ontological
or
epistemological


some
rely
on
psychology
or
sociology


positions
of
philosophers
kant
according
to
kant
there
can
be
no
proof
of
a
supreme
being
that
is
made
using
reason


in
his
work
critique
of
pure
reason
he
tries
to
show
that
all
attempts
of
either
proving
the
existence
of
god
or
disproving
it
end
in
a
logical
contradictions


kant
says
that
it
is
impossible
to
know
whether
there
are
any
higher
beings


this
makes
him
an
agnostic


ludwig
ludwig
published
the
essence
of
christianity
in


in
his
work
he
postulates
the
following
religion
is
not
only
a
historical
or
transcendental
fact
but
most
of
all
an
achievement
of
human
consciousness
its
mind
or
its
imagination


all
religions
are
only
different
in
their
form
but
they
have
one
thing
in
common
they
are
projections
of
unmet
needs
of
human
nature


god
and
all
religious
content
is
nothing
more
than
psychological
projections


the
material
causes
of
these
projections
are
rooted
in
the
nature
of
human
beings

hippocrates
hippocrates
was
a
greek
doctor


he
was
probably
born
in
and
died
in


hippocrates
is
called
the
father
of
medicine


he
was
the
first
person
to
write
that
people
got
sick
for
scientific
reasons


people
used
to
believe
disease
was
caused
by
angry
mad
gods


hippocrates
wrote
about
treating
sick
people


his
writings
are
still
important
to
doctors
today


he
said
many
ideas
that
doctors
still
study


an
idea
he
wrote
about
is
patient
confidentiality


this
means
that
doctors
can
not
tell
anyone
else
what
their
patients
tell
them


another
idea
is
that
the
doctor
can
not
do
anything
to
kill
a
patient


these
kinds
of
ideas
are
part
of
medical
ethics


the
hippocratic
oath
is
named
after
him


this
is
a
promise
or
oath
doctors
say


this
means
they
say
they
will
do
what
is
said
in
the
hippocratic
oath


people
now
think
that
hippocrates
did
not
write
it


most
medical
schools
today
use
a
new
version


this
means
that
some
things
are
changed


but
the
important
ideas
are
the
same


this
is
an
example
of
a
modern
hippocratic
oath


this
is
used
today
at
the
university
of
north
carolina
school
of
medicine


i
do
solemnly
swear
by
all
i
hold
most
sacred
that
i
will
be
loyal
to
the
profession
of
medicine
and
just
to
its
members
that
i
will
lead
my
life
and
practice
my
art
with
virtue
and
honor
that
into
whatsoever
home
i
shall
enter
it
shall
be
for
the
good
of
the
sick
and
the
well
by
the
utmost
of
my
power
and
that
i
will
hold
myself
aloof
from
wrong
and
from
corruption
and
from
the
tempting
of
others
to
vice
that
i
will
exercise
my
art
solely
for
the
benefit
of
my
patients
the
relief
of
suffering
the
prevention
of
disease
and
promotion
of
health
and
i
will
give
no
drug
and
perform
no
act
for
an
immoral
purpose
that
in
the
treatment
of
the
sick
i
will
consider
their
to
be
of
a
greater
importance
than
their
ability
to
compensate
my
services
that
what
i
may
see
or
hear
in
the
course
of
treatment
or
even
outside
the
treatment
in
regard
to
the
lives
of
persons
which
is
not
fitting
to
be
spoken
i
will
keep
secret
that
i
will
commit
myself
to
a
lifetime
of
continued
learning
of
the
art
and
science
of
medicine
these
things
i
do
promise
and
in
proportion
as
i
am
faithful
to
this
oath
may
happiness
and
good
repute
be
ever
mine
but
should
i
trespass
and
violate
this
oath
may
the
reverse
be
my
lot

is
a
concept
in
the
philosophy
of
science


scientific
theories
are
described
as
if
one
can
compare
them
to
find
out
which
is
more
accurate


if
there
is
no
way
one
can
compare
them
to
determine
which
is
more
accurate
they
are


behind
this
is
the
idea
that
it
is
possible
to
see
the
world
in
multiple
ways
and
that
there
is
not
one
fair
method
to
see
which
way
is
right


some
think
that
that
scientific
traditions
or
paradigms
can
be
it
is
not
really
possible
to
say
which
one
is
right


this
idea
has
been
defended
by
thomas


he
wrote
when
paradigms
change
the
world
changes
with
them


paul
was
another
philosopher
who
said
that
was
possible
in
scientific
topics


he
wrote
that
it
is
important
to
remember
this
because
it
means
that
it
is
possible
to
say
things
that
are
not
scientific
but
also
not
wrong


these
ideas
were
mainly
aimed
at
popper
and
his
ideas
on
falsification


two
theories
may
not
be
comparable
if
one
can
not
find
a
way
to
compare
them
and
decide
which
is
right


in
popular
culture
the
concept
of
is
dramatized
in
the
movie
when
army
scientist
joe
attempts
to
explain
before
a
full
cabinet
meeting
his
theory
that
the
nation
crops

harvest
means

it
is

also
mean
to

stands

spot
assay


it
is
a
laboratory
technique
for
detecting
cells
that
make

various
substances


these
substances
include
specific
types
of
or
antibodies


the
method
is
typically
used

and
is
a
helpful
tool
in
studying
the

vaccines


in
the
technique
tiny
wells
are
used
to
contain

the

cause

these

capabilities


the
technique
is
very

and
can
detect

the
word
billion
and
its
matching
words
in
other
languages
can
mean
one
of
two
different
numbers


at
the
end
of
the
century
a
change
was
made
in
the
way
of
writing
large
numbers


before
the
change
they
were
written
into
groups
of
six
digits


after
that
until
today
we
use
groups
of
three
digits
separated
by
a
comma
or
a
space


after
the
change
some
italian
and
french
scientists
began
using
the
word
billion
to
mean
one
thousand
million


they
also
changed
the
meaning
of
trillion
and
other
large
number
words


the
starting
point
is
one
thousand
instead
of
one
million


this
is
known
in
french
as
the
short
scale


it
is
used
in
the
us
and
because
of
the
us
financial
importance
it
is
used
in
other
english
speaking
countries
too
even
changing
the
dictionary
definition


another
word
for
this
number
is


the
original
meaning
started
in
the
century
was
a
million
of
a
million
which
led
to
the
name
bi
or


this
system
known
in
french
as
the
longue
long
scale
is
used
in
most
countries
where

is
not
the
