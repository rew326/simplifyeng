also
known
as
shingles
or
zona
is
a
disease
in
humans


the

virus
that
causes

also
causes

the
symptoms
are

rash

general
information
shingles
is
a
viral
disease
produced
by
the
varicella
virus
the
same
virus
that
causes
chicken
pox


its
symptoms
include
pain
and
a
blistering
rash
that
occurs
along
the
nerves
that
contain
dormant
virus


you
can
not
catch
shingles


however
you
can
catch
chicken
pox
through
direct
contact
with
someone
who
has
shingles
by
touching
the
area
of
the
rash


most
people
who
get
shingles
are
old


it
sometimes
infects
younger
people
or
people
with
a
weakened
immune
system


stress
may
<collocation>trigger shingles</collocation>


the
disease
starts
with
tingling
itchiness
or
pain
on
an
infected
person
skin


after
a
few
days
the
disease
causes
a
blistering
rash


this
rash
may
be
on
the
trunk
or
face


the
rash
grows
into
small
blisters
filled
with
fluid


these
blisters
dry
out
and
crust
over
for
several
days


the
rash
causes
anything
from
mild
itching
to
extreme
pain


the
<collocation>rash stays</collocation>
in
one
region
of
the
body


the
shingles
virus
is
contagious
from
person
to
person
only
by
direct
contact


for
this
reason
persons
with
shingles
are
advised
to
limit
contact
with
those
who
are
not
immune
to
chicken
pox
those
with
increased
risk
are
young
children
and
pregnant
women


contracting
chickenpox
when
one
is
pregnant
can
be
dangerous
to
the
<collocation>unborn child</collocation>


if
people
have
had
chickenpox
they
can
not
get
chickenpox
from
someone
else
again


however
it
is
thought
that
contact
with
a
shingles
patient
may
trigger
a
person
own
dormant
<collocation>chickenpox virus</collocation>
to
become
shingles


<collocation>treatment doctors</collocation>
recommend
antiviral
drugs
steroids
antidepressants
and
<collocation>topical agents</collocation>
to
treat
shingles


the
antiviral
drugs
acyclovir
and
can
reduce
the
severity
of
shingles


prognosis
shingles
can
be
very
painful
and
itchy


it
is
not
very
dangerous
to
healthy
people
and
it
usually
ends
without
major
problems


the
rash
and
pain
last
to
weeks


sometimes
serious
problems
like
temporary
<collocation>partial facial</collocation>
paralysis
ear
damage
or
encephalitis
may
occur


persons
with
shingles
on
the
upper
half
of
the
face
need
immediate
medical
attention
the
virus
may
cause
serious
damage
to
the
eyes


most
people
who
have
shingles
have
only
one
attack
of
the
disease
in
their
lifetime


however
people
with
aids
cancer
or
weak
immune
systems
may
have
multiple
attacks

a

of
what
ptolemy
thought
about
the
location
of
the
planets
stars
and
sun


in
the
first
part
of
the
book
hawking
talks
about
the
history
of
physics


he
talks
about
the
ideas
of
philosophers
such
as
aristotle
and
ptolemy


aristotle
unlike
many
other
people
of
his
time
thought
that
the
earth
was
round


he
also
thought
that
the
sun
and
stars
went
around
the
earth


ptolemy
also
thought
about
how
the
sun
and
stars
were
located
in
the
universe


he
made
a
planetary
model
that
described
aristotle
thinking


today
it
is
known
that
the
opposite
is
true
the
earth
goes
around
the
sun
