in
mathematics
the
pythagorean
theorem
or
pythagoras
theorem
is
a
statement
about
the
sides
of
a
right
triangle


one
of
the
angles
of
a
right
triangle
is
always
equal
to
degrees


this
angle
is
the
right
angle


the
two
sides
next
to
the
right
angle
are
called
the
legs
and
the
other
side
is
called
the
hypotenuse


the
hypotenuse
is
the
side
opposite
to
the
right
angle
and
it
is
always
the
longest
side


the
pythagorean
theorem
says
that
the
area
of
a
square
on
the
hypotenuse
is
equal
to
the
sum
of
the
areas
of
the
squares
on
the
legs


in
this
picture
the
area
of
the
blue
square
added
to
the
area
of
the
red
square
makes
the
area
of
the
purple
square


it
was
named
after
the
greek
mathematician
pythagoras
if
the
lengths
of
the
legs
are
a
and
b
and
the
length
of
the
hypotenuse
is
c
then
a
b
c


there
are
many
different
proofs
of
this
theorem


they
fall
into
four
categories
those
based
on
linear
relations
the
algebraic
proofs


those
based
upon
comparison
of
areas
the
geometric
proofs


those
based
upon
the
vector
operation

one

the
proof
uses
three

have
the

a
triangle
which
has
the

has

the

the

because

this
halves
of
the

are
the

temperature
is
how
hot
or
cold
a
thing
is


our
bodies
can
feel
the
difference
between
something
which
is
hot
and
something
which
is
cold


to
measure
temperature
more
accurately
a
thermometer
can
be
used


thermometers
use
a
temperature
scale
to
record
how
hot
or
cold
something
is


the
scale
most
often
used
is
in
degrees
celsius
c
sometimes
called
centigrade


in
the
usa
<collocation>degrees fahrenheit</collocation>
f
are
more
often
used
while
scientists
mostly
use
k
to
measure
temperature
because
it
never
goes
below
zero


scientifically
temperature
is
a
physical
quantity
which
describes
how
quickly
molecules
are
moving
inside
a
material


in
solids
and
liquids
the
molecules
are
vibrating
around
a
fixed
point
in
the
substance
but
in
gases
they
are
in
free
flight
and
bouncing
off
each
other
as
they
travel


in
a
gas
the
temperature
pressure
and
volume
of
the

are
closely

so

temperature
and
heat
temperature
is
not
the
same
as
heat


heat
is
energy
which
moves
from
one
thing
cooling
it
to
another
heating
it


temperature
is
a
measure
of
the
movements
vibration
of
the
molecules
inside
a
thing


if
the
thing
has
a
high
temperature
it
means
the
average
speed
of
its
molecules
is
fast


a
thing
may
have
a
high
temperature
but
because
it
contains
very
few
or
light
atoms
it
has
very
little
heat


heat
capacity
the
amount
of
heat
that
is
needed
to
make
a
substance
one
degree
higher
is
called
its
heat
capacity


different
substances
have
different
<collocation>heat capacities</collocation>


for
example
a
kilogram
of
water
has
more
heat
capacity
than
a
kilogram
of
steel


this
means
that
more
energy
is
needed
to
make
the
temperature
of
water
c
hotter
than
is
needed
to
make
the
temperature
of
steel
c

weather
temperature
is
also
important
in
weather
and
climate


it
is
related
to
the
amount
of
heat
energy
in
the
air


maps
are
used
to
show
how
temperature
is
different
across
an
area


temperature
will
be
different
during
different
times
of
day
different
seasons
and
in
different

it
is
affected
by
how
much
heat
reaches
the

from
the

insulation
how

the

and


helped
hitler
write
the
book
but
he
is
not

as
an

the
book
consists
of
two
parts


the
first
part
was
written
by
hitler
while
he
was
in
jail
in
am
lech


he
was
put
in
jail
after
a
failed
putsch
in


he
wrote
the
second
part
after
his
early
release
from
jail


from
to
both
volumes
were
sold
separately
at
the
price
of
reichsmark
each


in
both
volumes
were
published
as
one
book


there
were
several
editions
between
and


with
each
new
edition
the
text
was
revised
as
well


this
was
done
to
clarify
those
parts
of
the
text
that
were
unclear


probably
around
hitler
did
this
work


in
the
book
hitler
describes
talks
about
his
view
of
greater
germany


he
also
describes
his
future
plan
for
jews


when
he
came
to
power
in
he
realized
made
happen
some
of
those
plans


this
resulted
in
a
genocide
known
as
the
holocaust


the
book
was
given
away
for
free
at
civil
<collocation>registry offices</collocation>
during
the
time
when
the
nazi
government
had
power
in
germany


the
reason
for
giving
the
book
away
for
free
was
because
in
part
the
book
was
propaganda
and
giving
it
away
free
was
a
way
to
recruit
members


after
the
second
<collocation>world war</collocation>
the
book
was
made
illegal
to
reprint
or
sell
new
copies
in
germany
and
austria


it
is
not
illegal
to
own
a
book
and
it
is
also
not
illegal
to

such
books

the
definition
of
the
thoughts
in
the
book


special
care
is
taken
to
put
marxism
as
something
very
bad


since
it
was
of
jewish
origin
it
should
be
abolished


at
the
same
time
the
idea
of
a
nationally
oriented
socialism
that
where
the
allied
word
nazi
national
comes
from
as
they
did
not
call
themselves
nazi


a
war
should
be
a
war
of
races
not
one
of
the
different
classes
in
society
against
each
other


with
this
they
wanted
to
get
sympathies
from
german
workers


the
political
system
of
the
soviet
union
they
called
bolshevism


the
soviet
union
should
be
split
into
parts


this
should
be
done
through
what
they
call
a
war
of
the
races
is
the
word
used
winning
that
war
would
give
the
people
of
aryan
blood
more
space
to
live
lebensraum
in
the
east


according
to
the
book
there
is
not
enough
space
for
the
german
people


at
the
time
the
book
was
written
germany
was
the
roughly
the
size
of
texas


germany
should
not
fight
a
war
on
two
fronts


for
this
reason
england
would
be
a
good
<collocation>strategic partner</collocation>
in
a
war
to
come


neither
wish
happened


parliaments
are
a
bad
thing
to
have


so
are
democracies


both
should
be
abolished
in
favor
of
a
state
where
one
leader
could
make
the
decisions


this
would
be
more
in
the
interest
of
the
people
it
was
said


all
this
is
mixed
together
to
form

program
