light
can
pass
through
transparent
things
the
most
easily


our
eyes
react
to
light
when
we
see
something
we
see
the
light
it
reflects
or
the
light
it
emits


for
example
a
lamp
gives
off
light
and
everything
else
in
the
same
room
as
the
lamp
reflects
its
light


every
color
of
light
has
a
different
wavelength


the
shorter
the
wavelength
the
more
energy
the
light
has


the
speed
at
which
light
moves
does
not
depend
on
its
energy


going
through
partly
clear
objects
can
slow
light
down
by
a
very
small
amount


white
light
is
made
up
of
many
different
colors
of
light
added
together


when
white
light
shines
through
a
prism
it
splits
up
into
different
colors
becoming
a
spectrum


the
spectrum
contains
all
of
the
wavelengths
of
light
that
we
can
see


red
light
has
the
longest
wavelength
and
violet
purple
light
has
the
shortest


light
with
a
wavelength
shorter
than
violet
is
called
ultraviolet
light


and
<collocation>gamma rays</collocation>
are
also
forms
of
light
with
even
shorter
wavelengths
than
ultraviolet


light
with
a
wavelength
longer
than
red
is
called
infrared
light


radio
waves
are
a
form
of
electromagnetic
radiation
with
a
wavelength
even
longer
than
infrared
light


the
microwaves
that
are
used
to
heat
food
in
a
microwave
oven
are
also
a
form
of
electromagnetic
radiation


our
eyes
can
not
see
those
kinds
of
energy
but
there
are
some
cameras
that
can
see
them


the
various
forms
of
light
both
visible
and
invisible
are
the
<collocation>electromagnetic spectrum</collocation>


when
light
is
refracted
in
raindrops
a
rainbow
is
made


the
raindrop
acts
like
a
prism
and
refracts
the
light
until
we
can
see
the
colors
of
the
spectrum


<collocation>color rainbow</collocation>
in
budapest
shows
the
colors
of
the
<collocation>visible spectrum</collocation>
light
and
color
are
forms
of
analog
information


however
electronic
cameras
and
computer
displays
work
with
digital
information


so
electronic
cameras
or
document
scanners
make
a
digital
version
of
a
color
image
by
separating
out
the
full
color
image
into
separate
red
green
and
blue
images


later
a
digital
display
uses
pixels
of
just
those
three
colors


computer
screens
use
only
these
three
colors
in
different
brightness
levels


the
brain
combines
them
to
see
all
of
the
other
colors
in
the
image


people
think
of
objects
as
having
color


scientist
explain
this
because
the
molecules
that
make
up
the
object
absorb
certain
light
waves
leaving
the
other
light
waves
to
bounce
off


the
human
eye
sees
the
wave
lengths
of
all
of
the
light
that
was
not
absorbed
and
the
combination
of
those
leaves
the
brain
with
the
impression
of
a
color

around

therefore
the

is
known
as

as

forms
rain


the

<collocation>annual rainfall</collocation>
totals
occur
in
mountain
areas


there
is
often
a

whereby
the
leeward

receives
a
relatively
small

frontal
<collocation>rain frontal</collocation>
rain
happens
when

the
less

rises

these
clouds
grow
and
eventually
create

in
some
places

the

a
fish
market
in
south
korea
wet
market
in
singapore
a
market
is
a
place
where
people
go
to
buy
or
sell
things


when
people
have
products
to
sell
they
set
up
a
market
place


there
may
be
a
special
building
for
the
market
place
or
the
market
may
be
held
in
an
open
space
where
the
sellers
can
put
up
a
stall
like
a
kind
of
tent
and
then
take
the
stall
down
at
the
end
of
the
day


the
word
market
can
also
have
a
more
general
meaning
in
the
economy


it
can
mean
the
way
things
are
bought
or
sold


there
is
a
big
market
for
dishwashers
means
that
lots
of
people
want
to
buy
dishwashers
so
therefore
a
business
that
makes
dishwashers
is
likely
to
be
able
to
make
a
lot
of
money


when
things
are
sold
people
buy
the
product
and
this
stimulates
the
economy
helps
people
to
spend
and
earn
money


the
market
needs
to
balance
supply
and
demand


there
is
no
point
in
supplying
making
lots
of
dishwashers
if
people
do
not
want
them


in
the
market
prices
may
change
quickly
if
supply
or
demand
changes


competition
if
a
seller
of
a
good
can
not
supply
what
costumers
want
or
ask
for
too
high
of
a
price
other
sellers
may
try
to
supply
that
good


if
other
sellers
enter
the
market
for
that
good
in
competition
that
will
tend
to
fulfill
demand
and
lower
prices


sellers
do
not
like
competition
and
may
try
to
kill
the
competition


sellers
that
kill
competition
want
to
earn
profits
that
they
should
not
get
and
they
must
be
stopped
by
laws


an
electron
is
a
very
small
piece
of
matter
and

electron
is
a
<collocation>subatomic particle</collocation>


it
is
believed
to
be
an
elementary
particle
because
it
can
not
be
broken
down
into
anything
smaller
