thunder
is
a
very
loud
sound
that
is
made
sometimes
during
a
very
big
rain
storm


thunder
is
so
loud
it
can
be
heard
from
a
very
far
distance


it
can
sound
like
a
boom
a
crash
or
a
rumble


thunder
is
made
when
lightning
strikes


the
energy
from
the
lightning
heats
up
the
air
so
much
that
it
makes
a
kind
of
explosion


when
lightning
is
very
near
thunder
will
be
heard
soon
after
the
lightning
flash
and
the
sound
will
be
very
loud


if
the
lightning
is
farther
away
the
thunder
will
be
a
few
seconds
or
many
seconds
after
the
lightning


people
can
guess
how
far
away
the
lightning
is
by
counting
the
number
of
seconds
between
the
time
they
see
the
lightning
