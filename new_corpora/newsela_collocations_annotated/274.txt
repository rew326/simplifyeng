dragonflies
can
move
each
of

wings
independently
which

them
their

abilities


<collocation>dragonflies bend</collocation>

a

the
flight
style
of

is
one

they

powerful
wings

examples
trivia
origin
some
animals
live
in
a
social
structure
where
the
most
powerful
male
in
the
group
is
decided
by
either
fights
or
even
very
aggressive
battles
sometimes
ending
in
death
in
the
wild
the
current
alpha
male
must
defend
his
ranking
from
younger
members


when
he
is
too
old
or
not
strong
enough
to
win
he
loses
his
position
in
the
group
fighting
to
the
death
or
running
out


the
result
of
this
is
that
the
alpha
male
usually
has
more
opportunity
to
mate
with
the
available
females


this
system
developed
because
strong
males
will
produce
young
which
have
a
better
chance
for
survival

malay
