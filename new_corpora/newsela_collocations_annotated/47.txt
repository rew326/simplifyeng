the

arabic
language
is
a
news
source
many
muslims
watch


in
most
muslim
nations
the
government
is
the
main
source
of
news


this
sometimes
makes
it
very
difficult
or
dangerous
to
make
statements


there
are
however
many
other
news
programs
and
websites
in
the
muslim
world


islam
in
law
and
ethics
islamic
law
exists
in
many
variations
in
arabic
it
is
called
five
schools
of
which
were
created
centuries
ago


these
are
the
classical
the
school
from
india
pakistan
and
west
africa
egypt
the
in
north
africa
and
west
africa
the
in
malaysia
and
indonesia
the
in
arabia
and
in
iran
and
iraq
where
the
majority
is


all
five
are
very
old
and
many
muslims
feel
a
new
must
be
created
for
modern
society


islam
has
a
method
for
doing
this
and
are
the
words
to
describe
this
method
but
they
have
not
been
used
in
a
long
time
and
few
people
are
trusted
enough
to
use
them
to
make
new
laws


so
in
most
of
the
muslim
world
people
are
very
conservative
especially
about
alcohol
adultery
abortion
and
women
working
in
jobs
where
they
are
used
to
lure
customers


muslim
women
often
dress
extremely
modestly
and
many
do
so
by
choice


but
in
some
countries
they
have
been
forced
to
do
so
against
their
will


this
is
one
of
the
things
that
causes
tension
between
the
western
world
and
that
of
muslims


islamic
economics
bans
debt
but
in
most
muslim
countries
western
banking
is
allowed


this
is
another
issue
that
many
muslims
have
with
the
western
world


islam
in
politics
one
quarter
of
the
world
population
share
islam
as
an
<collocation>ethical tradition</collocation>


many
people
in
these
countries
also
see
islam
as
a
political
movement


in
democratic
countries
there
is
usually
at
least
one
islamic
party


political
islam
is
powerful
in
all
countries


islamic
parties
in
pakistan
and
algeria
have
taken
power


many
in
these
movements
call
themselves
which
also
sometimes
describes
more
militant
islamic
groups


the
relationships
between
these
groups
and
their
views
of
democracy
are
complex


some
of
these
groups
are
called
terrorists
because
they
attack
civilians
of
other
nations
to
make
a
political
point


conflicts
with
israel
and
the
us
israel
is
very
unpopular
in
the
muslim
world
because
of
the
conflict
and
the
way
that
the
state
of
israel
came
into
being
in
which
many
arabs
thought
was
unfair


some
muslims
see
this
as
a
fight
against
judaism
or
jews
but
not
all


in
morocco
for
instance
the
recently
invited
jews
to
join
the
party


jewish
groups
also
cooperate
with
arabs
in
the
west
bank
where
orthodox
jewish
leader
rabbi
served
as
the
minister
for
jewish
affairs
in
the
before
there
was
a
<collocation>palestinian authority</collocation>


like
the
arabs
this
small
group
of
jews
thought
the
way
israel
was
created
was
not
right


however
very
few
jews
believe
this
and
most
support
israel
as
a
state


in
there
was
a
big
shift
in
the
way
the
muslim
world
dealt
with
the
rest
of
the
world


in
that
year
egypt
made
peace
with
israel
iran
became
an
islamic
state
after
a
revolution
and
there
was
an
invasion
of
afghanistan
by
the
soviet
union


a
lot
of
things
changed
in
that
year


by
the
soviet
union
was
gone
jordan
had
also
made
peace
with
israel
and
on
september
there
were
major
attacks
on
the
which
most
people
believe
were
made
to
drive
the
united
states
out
of
the
muslim
world
especially
<collocation>saudi arabia</collocation>


in
many
ways
the
events
of
led
to
the
events
of


the
invasion
of
afghanistan
and
invasion
of
iraq
are
called
part
of
a
war
on
terrorism
by
the
united
states


many
or
most
muslims
see
it
as
a
war
on
islam


after
the
invasion
the
islamic
parties
won
more
seats
and
a
majority
of
muslims
polled
in
many
nations
expressed
support
for
bin
laden
and
said
he
would
do
the
right
thing


is
a
french
scholar
who
thinks
that
this
does
not
express
support
for
or
militant
islam
but
opposing
colonialism
and
what
many
muslims
call
racism
<collocation>favourable treatment</collocation>
for
jews
especially
those
living
in
west
bank
settlements
many
of
whom
have
american
or
british
passport
and
which
the
united
nations
says
have
no
right
to
live
there


the
situation
is
very
complicated
and
there
are
many
different
views
of
it


organization
the
organization
of

in
lets
the
muslim

work

russia

the

of
only
the
arab
countries


opec
is
another
forum
where
issues
between
the
muslim
and
world
come
up


in
to
protest
support
for
israel
there
was
an

or
is
the
theory
of
a
set
of
multiple
possible
universes
including
our
universe
which
make
up
reality


these
universes
are
sometimes
called
<collocation>parallel universes</collocation>


a
number
of
different
versions
have
been
considered


they
all
have
the
same
weakness
there
is
no

way
these
ideas
can
be
tested


you
can
think
of

as

of
these
bubbles
collide
they
may
have
caused
the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>


they

the

was

by

the
mechanistic
paradigm
also
known
as
the
newtonian
paradigm
assumes
that
things
in
the
environment
around
humans
are
more
like
machines
than
like
life


it
was
more
common
in
the
century


this
is
a
set
of
loosely
related
beliefs
that
affects
all
sciences
in
physics
it
presents
atoms
as
made
of
particles
in
preference
to
say
the
wave
theory
of
light


in
fact
both
the
particle
and
wave
view
are
required
to
explain
everything
light
does
but
are
rarely
presented
as
equals


many
physics
students
graduate
fully
understanding
the
hydrogen
bomb
but
having
no
clear
idea
of
how
musical
instruments
work


in
astrophysics
it
assumes
that
the
universe
is
like
clockwork
and
works
on
its
own
without
our
choice
making
any
difference
this
fits
relativity
but
is
not
easy
to
combine
with
<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>


in
cosmology
it
accepts
models
of
our
universe
more
easily
if
reject
the
continuous
creation
of
matter
energy
or
any
new
other
universes


in
chemistry
it
assumes
that
molecules
are
like
building
blocks
and
have
no
unpredictable
or
strange
and
unique
effects
when
combined


this
is
the
basic
assumption
of
which
some
scientists
think
will
create
a
molecular


in
biology
it
assumes
that
everything
about
life
all
of
biochemistry
is
predictable
from
chemistry
and
physics


believers
tend
to
<collocation>regard ecology</collocation>
and
psychology
as
less
scientific
than
physics
chemistry
and
biology


believers
may
reject
ideas
like
philosophy
or
fecund
universes
for
no
scientific
reason
simply
because
these
theories
assume
higher
level
phenomena
sometimes
drive
lower
levels


greedy
may
be
more
likely
among
believers
in
mechanistic
ideas


for
instance
they
may
want
to
always
see
things
as
made
of
smaller
even
invisible
parts
that
no
one
can
see
or
prove
is
real
like
in
string
theory


for
this
reason
when
they
work
in
psychology
they
may
prefer
theories
like
that
deny
free
will
and
try
to
explain
<collocation>human behavior</collocation>
as
a
function
of
biology


the
philosophy
of
mathematics
of
most
believers
is
a
form
of


this
assumes
there
is
a
perfect
or
ideal
form
that
theories
only
approximate


this
lets
them
explain
inaccuracies
in
mechanistic
theories
as
being
due
to
an
imperfection
in
human
ability
to
reason
instead
of
imperfections
in
math
itself


believers
in
this
paradigm
sometimes
say
that
those
who
do
not
believe
in
it
are
following
a
<collocation>cognitive paradigm</collocation>
but
almost
no
one
uses
this
term
since
it
is
redundant
cognitive
science
is
already
accepted
as
the
most
basic
idea
in
the
philosophy
of
science


but
reject
some
of
the
ideas
of
cognitive
scientists
like
cognitive
science
of
mathematics


mechanistic
thinking
also
assumes
that
philosophy
of
perception
is
much
less
important
than
cognitive
scientists
say
it
is
that
humans
and
their
beliefs
and
equipment
do
not
generally
add
a
lot
of
bias
to
a
scientific
theory


thomas
said
otherwise
that
these
things
matter
and
that
the
major
assumptions
of
science
can
shift
drastically


this
he
called
a
<collocation>paradigm shift</collocation>


the
shift
from
mechanistic
to
<collocation>cognitive paradigm</collocation>
is
an
example
of
this


later
he
used
other
words
to
describe
the
assumptions
and
beliefs
like
but
the
word
paradigm
is
still
used


some
say
it
is
much


economics
is
often
said
to
suffer
from
assumptions
of
the
mechanistic
paradigm


sometimes
those
who
believe
in
neoclassical
economics
and
also
in
the
mechanistic
paradigm
say
they
seek
to
unify
physics
and
economics
as
if
people
and
particles
behaved
as
two
examples
of
the
same
kind
of
thing


technology
is
often
easier
to
make
if
people
accept
a
mechanistic
paradigm
but
it
may
be
harder
to
say
why
it
does
not
work
if
one
believes
in
these
ideas


for
instance
creating
diagnostic
trees
might
be
easier
if
one
works
from
experience
not
from
an
idea
of
how
a
technology
should
or
must
work


a
controversial
idea
is
that
mechanistic
ideas
are
just
an
older
idea
called
with
more
mathematics


both
tried
to
work
from
what
should
or
must
be
instead
of
what
experiment
seemed
to
show


another
controversial
idea
is
that
belief
in
science
as
if
it
were
a
religion
or
<collocation>ethical tradition</collocation>
comes
from
this
paradigm


most
scientists
who
are
mechanistic
do
not
say
they
see
science
as
a
guide
to
ethics
but
try
to
keep
them
