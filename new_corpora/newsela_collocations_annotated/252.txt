writing
mandarin
is
written
with
chinese
characters
called
or


each
has
its
own
pronunciation
and
meaning


an
ordinary
dictionary
will
contain
about
characters


spoken
mandarin
uses
very
many
compound
words
words
that
combine
meanings
the
way
english
does
in
such
terms
as
<collocation>machine gun</collocation>
fire
truck
playground


the
are
ideograms
one
character
means
one
idea


the
various
concepts
are
derived
from
the
ideograms
by
combining
them


mandarin
can
be
also
written
phonetically
that
is
written
as
it
is
spoken
with
latin
alphabet
as
you
really
can
not
see
the
spelling
from
characters


that
is
called


the
most
popular
system
is
called


some
chinese
characters
were
originally
fairly
concrete
pictures
of
the
things
they
represent


as
time
went
on
people
chose
to
write
simpler
versions
that
are
easier
to
write
but
do
not
look
so
much
like
the
real
thing
just
as
we
sometimes
draw
stick
men
rather
than
drawing
people
with
bodies
arms
legs


here
are
some
examples
archaic
seal
script
traditional
modern
simplified
gloss
human
female
human
child
sun
moon
mountain
river
water
rain
bamboo
tree
horse
bird
turtle
dragon
most
characters
however
are
made
by
combining
pictures
using
one
to
give
a
general
meaning
and
the
other
to
represent
a
sound


for
instance
mom
is
made
by
adding
human
female
to
horse


the
ma
part
is
only
there
to
represent
the
sound


in
ancient
chinese
one
character
is
generally
enough
for
one
word
but
spoken
mandarin
uses
mostly
compounds
like
which
is
just
mama


other
examples
show
different
ways
of
combining
components
lit


fire
vehicle
locomotive
train
lit


big
person
adult
lit


strike
open
open
up
door
window
envelope
just
as
the
english
used
in
great
britain
favors
petrol
but
the
english
used
in
the
united
states
almost
always
uses
gasoline
different
regional
languages
in
china
may
use
different
compound
words
to
name
the
same
thing


difference
between
mandarin
accent
and
<collocation>dialect mandarin</collocation>
is
defined
and
designed
based
on
accent


in
china
there
are
over
dialects
and
more
accents
although
they
all
use
chinese
language
and
characters
but
their
pronunciation
and
some
expressions
are
totally
different


china

find
a
standard
pronunciation
to
make
all
people
to
understand
and
communicate
