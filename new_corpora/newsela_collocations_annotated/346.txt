pollution
water
pollution
is
the
presence
of
harmful
materials
in
water
such
as
sewage
dissolved
metals
waste
from
farms
and
factories
and
<collocation>crude oil</collocation>
spilled
from
shipwrecked
tankers


the
three
main
substances
that
pollute
water
are
nitrates
from
fertilizers
sewage
and
detergents


pollution
causes
harm
to
organisms
living
in

and
can
also
harm
people
health


in
extreme
cases
it
may
cause
problems
such

the
harmful

in

the
sound
of

in

is
called
<collocation>noise pollution</collocation>


<collocation>noise pollution</collocation>
can
cause

even
<collocation>permanent deafness</collocation>
especially
to

<collocation>noise pollution</collocation>

<collocation>soil pollution</collocation>
<collocation>soil pollution</collocation>
is
when

these

come
from

from

the

immunity
is
the
ability
of
the
body
to
defend
itself
from
foreign
bodies


this
means
rejecting
infections
clearing
up
dust
which
gets
in
the
lungs
and
killing
cancer
cells


vaccination
builds
on
the
natural
immune
system
to
make
a
person
resist
certain
diseases


immunity
is
of
two
types


<collocation>innate immunity</collocation>
protects
the
host
against
infection
but
has
no
memory
and
so
gives
no
immunity


the
second
type
is
adaptive
immunity
which
does
have
a
kind
of
memory


it
does
give
protection
against
specific
pathogens


all
animals
plants
and
fungi
have
some
<collocation>innate immunity</collocation>


vertebrates
also
have
adaptive
immunity


people
can
be
immunised
from
some
diseases
by
having
a
vaccination
injection
of
some
dead
or
weakened
virus
or
bacteria
that
causes
the
disease


by
doing
so
the
body
learns
how
the
harms
the
body
and
will
react
more
quickly
to
fight
the
when
it
comes
in
contact
with
the
again


when
your
body
has
defended
itself
against
the
it
will
trap
the
certain
in
a
net
so
when
the
comes
back
it
will
be
easier
to
trap
those
as
well


history
of
paul
is
a
science
that
examines
the
structure
and
function
of
the
immune
system


it
originates
from
medicine
and
early
studies
on
the
causes
of
immunity
to
disease


the
earliest
known
mention
of
immunity
was
during
the
plague
of
athens
in


noted
that
people
who
had
recovered
from
a
<collocation>previous bout</collocation>
of
the
disease
could
nurse
the
sick
without
contracting
the
illness
a
second
time


in
the
century
de
made
experiments
with
scorpion
venom
and
observed
that
certain
dogs
and
mice
were
immune
to
this
venom


this
and
other
observations
of
acquired
immunity
was
later
exploited
by
louis
pasteur
in
his
development
of
vaccination
and
his
proposed
germ
theory
of
disease


pasteur
theory
was
in
direct
opposition
to
contemporary
theories
of
disease
such
as
the
<collocation>miasma theory</collocation>


it
was
not
until
robert
proofs
for
which
he
was
awarded
a
nobel
prize
in
that
microorganisms
were
confirmed
as
the
cause
of
infectious
disease


viruses
were
confirmed
as
human
pathogens
in
with
the
discovery
of
the
yellow
fever
virus
by
walter
reed


made
a
great
advance
towards
the
end
of
the
century
through
rapid
developments
in
the
study
of
immunity
antibodies
and
<collocation>cellular immunity</collocation>
t
cells
and
cells


particularly
important
was
the
work
of
paul
who
proposed
the
theory
to
explain
the
specificity
of
the
reaction
his
contributions
to
the
understanding
of
immunity
were
recognized
by
the
award
of
a
nobel
prize
in
which
was
jointly
awarded
to
the
founder
of

a
<collocation>roman numeral</collocation>
is
the
name
for
a
number
when
it
is
written
in
the
way
the
romans
used
to
write

roman
numerals
are
not
used
very
often
today
in
the
west


they
are
used
to
write
the
names
of
kings
and
queens
or
popes


for
example
queen
elizabeth

they
may
be
used

so

it

only

not

so

always

never
especially
on
clocks

watches
can
sometimes
still
be
found


this
is
done
partly
because
the
for
the
position
aesthetically
balances
the

also
some
use
it
as
a
metaphor
that
was
commonplace
in
an
period
of
time
earlier
than
the
idea
of
subtraction
ix
was
introduced
into
writing

earlier

day
than

is
to
subtract
only

thus

written

would
not
be

it
is

similarly

rather

when

are
published
the

may
be
done
as

a
map
of
the
earth
made
in
commons
a
map
is
an
image
of
an
area
usually
of
the
earth
or
part
of
the
earth


a
map
is
different
from
an
<collocation>aerial photograph</collocation>
because
it
includes
interpretation


the
word
map
can
also
be
used
to
talk
about
a
chart
or
drawing
that
shows
relationships
between
ideas
people
events
or
anything
else
you
can
think
about


this
is
why
web
developers
call
a
list
of
web
pages
on
a
web
site
a
site
map


people
who
make
maps
are
cartographers


many
maps
today
are
made
using
computer
systems


these
are
database
systems
that
are
organized
by
location
instead
of
named
records


if
a
map
is
on
a
piece
of
paper
or
a
computer
screen
it
has
to
be
projected


this
is
because
the
earth
is
round
and
paper
and
screens
are
flat


there
are
a
lot
of
ways
that
use
mathematics
to
make
projections


the
only
kind
of
map
of
the
earth
that
is
not
projected
is
one
drawn
on
a
sphere


this
is
called
a
globe
