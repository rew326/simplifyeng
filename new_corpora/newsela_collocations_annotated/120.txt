first
for

second
to

download

onto

then
they
take

someone

would

slowly


they
would
only

if

is
sitting
on
the

then
the

would
swing
forward
faster

there
are
various
copies
of
the
original
kilogram


some
of
these
copies
have
gained

originally
the

the
second
minute
small
division
of
an
hour


the
<collocation>first division</collocation>
was
known
as
a
prime
minute
and
is
equivalent
to
the
minute
we
know
today


the
factor
of
comes
from
the
babylonians
who
used
factors
of
in
their
counting
system


however
the
babylonians
did
not
subdivide
their
time
units
except
for
the
day


the
hour
had
been
defined
by
the
ancient
egyptians
as
either
of
daytime
or
of
nighttime
hence
both
varied
with
the
seasons


hellenistic
astronomers
including
and
ptolemy
defined
the
hour
as
of
a
mean
solar
day


subdividing
this
mean
solar
hour
made
the
second
of
a
mean
solar
day


fact
date
april
it
rather
unlikely
the
ancients
defined
the
second
this
way
which
placing
it
here
suggests
hellenistic
time
periods
like
the
mean
month
were
usually
specified
quite
precisely
because
they
were
calculated
from
carefully
selected
eclipses
separated
by
hundreds
of
years
individual
mean
months
and
similar
time
periods
can
not
be
measured


nevertheless
with
the
development
of
<collocation>pendulum clocks</collocation>
keeping
mean
time
as
opposed
to
the
apparent
time
displayed
by
the
second
became
measurable


the
<collocation>seconds pendulum</collocation>
was
proposed
as
a
unit
of
length
as
early
as
by
the
royal
society
of
london


the
duration
of
a
beat
or
half
period
one
swing
not
back
and
forth
of
a
pendulum
one
metre
in
length
on
the
earth
surface
is
approximately
one
second


in
the
second
was
defined
in
terms
of
the
period
of
revolution
of
the
earth
around
the
sun
for
a
particular
epoch
because
by
then
it
had
become
recognized
that
the
earth
rotation
on
its
own
axis
was
not
sufficiently
uniform
as
a
standard
of
time


the
earth
motion
was
described
in
tables
of
the
sun
which
provides
a
formula
for
the
motion
of
the
sun
at
the
epoch
based
on
<collocation>astronomical observations</collocation>
made
between
and


the
second
thus
defined
is
the
fraction
of
the
tropical
year
for
january
at
hours
time


this
definition
was
ratified
by
the
eleventh
general
conference
on
weights
and
measures
in


the
tropical
year
in
the
definition
was
not
measured
but
calculated
from
a
formula
describing
a
tropical
year
which
decreased
over
time
hence
the
<collocation>curious reference</collocation>
to
a
specific
instantaneous
tropical
year


because
this
second
was
the
independent
variable
of
time
used
in
of
the
sun
and
moon
during
most
of
the
twentieth
century
tables
of
the
sun
were
used
from
through
and
brown
tables
of
the
moon
were
used
from
through
it
was
called
the
second


with
the
development
of
the
atomic
clock
it
was
decided
to
use
atomic
clocks
as
the
basis
of
the
definition
of
the
second
rather
than
the
revolution
of
the
earth
around
the
sun


following
several
years
of
work
louis
from
the
national
<collocation>physical laboratory</collocation>
england
and
william
from
the
united
states
<collocation>naval observatory</collocation>
determined
the
relationship
between
the
transition
frequency
of
the
atom
and
the
second


using
a
measurement
method
based
on
the
received
signals
from
radio
station
they
determined
the
orbital
motion
of
the
moon
about
the
earth
from
which
the
apparent
motion
of
the
sun
could
be
inferred
in
terms
of
time
as
measured
by
an
atomic
clock


as
a
result
in
the
thirteenth
general
conference
on
weights
and

defined
the
second
of
atomic
time
in
the
international
system
of
units
si
as
the
duration
of
periods
of
the
radiation
corresponding
to
the
transition
between
the
two
levels
of
the
ground
state
of
the
atom


the
ground
state
is
defined
at
zero
magnetic
field


the
second
thus
defined
is
equivalent
to
the
second


the
definition
of
the
second
was
later
refined
at
the
meeting
of
the
to
include
the
statement
this
definition
refers
to
a
atom
at
rest
at
a
temperature
of
the
revised
definition
would
seem
to
imply
that
the
ideal
atomic
clock
would
contain
a
single
atom
at
rest
emitting
a
single
frequency


in
practice
however
the
definition
means
that
realizations
of
the
second
should
compensate
for
the
effects
of
the
<collocation>ambient temperature</collocation>
radiation
within
which
atomic
clocks
operate
and
extrapolate
accordingly
to
the
value
of
the
second
as
defined
above


the
second
in
games
sometimes
in
a
second
is
used
to
refer
to
a
small
period
of
time
or
a
single
turn
of
combat


it
is
used
as
a
standard
moment
of
time
and
does
not
necessarily
refer
to
a
real
second
and
could
be
shorter
or
longer
depending
on
the
scenario


trivia
until
modern
times
degrees
and
hours
were
divided
successively
by
in
pars
prima
pars
secunda
pars
and
so
on


this
evolved
to
the
modern
minute
and
second
but
for
smaller
divisions
we
follow
now
the
decimal
division


in
some
languages
dictionaries
still
keep
the
word
for
third
for
of
a
second
for
example
polish
and
arabic
