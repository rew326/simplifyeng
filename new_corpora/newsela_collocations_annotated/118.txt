we
use

to
sequence

intervals

and
to

at
which

to
<collocation>measure time</collocation>
we
can
use
anything
that
repeats
itself
regularly


one
example
is
the
dawn
of
a
new
day
as
earth
rotates
on
its
axis


two

are
the

of
the

as

orbits
the
earth
and
the
seasons
of
the
year
as
the
earth
orbits
the
sun


even
in
ancient
times
people
developed
calendars
to
keep
track
of
the
number
of
days
in
a

they
also
developed
that
used
the
moving
<collocation>shadows cast</collocation>

to

term
the
force
in
physics
force
is
a
push
or
a
pull
that
changes
or
tends
to
change
the
state
of
rest
or
uniform
motion
of
an
object
or
changes
the
direction
or
shape
of
an
object


force
causes
objects
to
accelerate
add
to
the
object
overall
pressure
change
direction
or
change
shape


force
is
measured
in
newtons


a
force
is
always
a
push
pull
or
a
twist
and
it
affects
objects
by
pushing
them
up
pulling
them
down
pushing
them
to
a
side
or
by
changing
their
motion
or
shape
in
some
other
way


newton
second
law
according
to
newton
second
law
of
motion
the
formula
for
finding
force
is
f
ma
where
f
is
the
force
m
is
the
mass
of
an
object
and
a
is
the
acceleration
of
the
object


this
formula
says
that
when
there
is
a
force
on
an
object
then
it
will
move
faster
and
faster


if
the
force
is
weak
and
the
object
is
heavy
then
it
will
take
a
long
time
to
increase
the
speed
very
much
but
if
the
force
is
strong
and
the
object
is
light
then
it
will
move
a
lot
faster
very
quickly


<collocation>weight gravity</collocation>
is
a
force


everything
that
weighs
something
is
being
pulled
by
gravity


one
can
take
the
equation
above
and
change
a
to
the
standard
gravity
g
then
a
formula
about
the
gravity
on
earth
can
be
found
w
mg
where
w
is
the
weight
of
an
object
m
is
the
mass
of
an
object
and
g
is
the
acceleration
due
to
gravity
at
sea
level


it
is
about


this
formula
says
that
when
you
know
the
mass
of
an
object
then
you
can
calculate
how
much
force
there
is
on
the
object
because
of
gravity


you
must
be
on
earth
to
use
this
formula


if
you
are
on
the
moon
or
another
planet
then
you
can
use
the
formula
but
g
will
be
different


force
is
a
vector
so
it
can
be
stronger
or
weaker
and
it
can
also
point
in
different
directions


gravity
always
point
down
into
the
ground
if
you
are
not
in
space


gravitational
force
another
equation
that
says
something
about
gravity
is
f
gm
m
d
f
is
force
g
is
the
gravitational
constant
which
is
used
to
show
how
gravity
an
object
m
is
the
mass
of
one
object
m
is
the
mass
of
the
second
object
and
d
is
the
distance
between
the
objects


this
equation
is
used
to
calculate
how
the
earth
moves
around
the
sun
and
how
the
moon
moves
around
the
earth


it
is
also
used
to
calculate
how
other
planets
stars
and
objects
in
space
move
around


the
equation
says
that
if
two
objects
are
very
heavy
then
there
is
a
strong
force
between
them
because
of
gravity


if
they
are
very
far
apart
then
the
force
is
weaker

history
and

the
metric
system
was
created
in
france
after
the
french
revolution
in


the
original
system
only
had
two
standard
units
the
kilogram
and
the
metre


the
metric
system
became
popular
amongst
scientists


in
the
james
clerk
maxwell
and
william
later
known
as
lord
kelvin
suggested
a
system
with
three
base
units
length
mass
and
time


other
units
would
be
derived
from
those
three
base
units


later
this
suggestion
would
be
used
to
create
the
system
of
units
cgs
which
used
the
centimetre
as
the
base
unit
for
length
the
gram
as
the
base
unit
for
mass
and
the
second
as
the
base
unit
for
time


it
also
added
the
as
the
base
unit
for
force
and
the
erg
as
the
base
unit
for
energy


as
scientists
studied
electricity
and
magnetism
they
realized
other
base
units
were
needed
to
describe
these
subjects


by
the
middle
of
the
century
many
different
versions
of
the
metric
system
were
being
used


this
was
very
confusing


in
the
general
conference
on
weights
and
measures
created
the
first
version
of
the
international
system
of
units


the
six
base
units
that
they
used
were
the
metre
kilogram
second
kelvin
and
candela


the
seventh
base
unit
the
mole
was
added
in


si
is
now
used
almost
everywhere
in
the
world
except
in
the
united
states
liberia
and
where
the
older
imperial
units
are
still
widely
used


other
countries
most
of
them
historically
related
to
the
british
empire
are
slowly
replacing
the
old
imperial
system
with
the
metric
system
or
using
both
systems
at
the

time

simple

in
chemistry
a
mixture
is
a

that
is
made
up
of
two

simpler
substances


these
substances
can

chemical
elements

compounds


a

a

a

a
mixture
is
not

as
a

which
is
made
of
two
or
more
atoms
connected
together


for
instance
a
mixture
of
the
gases
hydrogen
and
nitrogen
contains
hydrogen
and
nitrogen
not
the
compound
ammonia
which
is
made
of
hydrogen

nitrogen
atoms


when
the
things
mixed
together
are
all
the
same
phase
like
two
solids
it
is
called
a
<collocation>homogeneous mixture</collocation>


if
different
phases
are
mixed
together
like
sand
and
water
it
is
called
a
heterogeneous
mixture


if
one
substance
in
a
mixture
dissolves
in
the
other
it
is
called
a
solution


for
example
if
sugar
is
put
in
water
it
forms
a
mixture
then
dissolves
to
make
a
solution


if
it
did
not
dissolve
it
would
be
called

language
families
of
the
world
today


language
families
are
groups
of
languages
that
are
related
to
each
other
because
they
come
from
a
common
older
language


the
languages
in
such
a
family
are
similar
in
their
vocabulary
or
structure


for
example
french
and
spanish
both
come
from
latin


latin
was
spoken
a
long
time
ago
and
some
of
the
people
who
spoke
it
started
to
speak
one
way
saying
for
example
for
good
bueno
while
another
group
started
saying
bon


most
words
are
said
a
little
differently
in
spanish
and
french
so
the
two
are
called
different
languages


most
languages
belong
to
a
language
family
but
some
languages
do
not


these
languages
are
called
<collocation>language isolates</collocation>


there
also
are
constructed
languages
like
for
example
esperanto


constructed
languages
are
made
for
different
reasons
making

for

the
opponent
pieces
off
the
board


the
player
with
white
pieces
always
