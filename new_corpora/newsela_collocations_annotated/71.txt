exploration
saturn
as
seen
from
the
spacecraft
in
saturn
was
first
explored
by
the
pioneer
spacecraft
in
september


it
flew
as
close
as
convert
km
mi
off
on
above
the
planet
<collocation>cloud tops</collocation>


it
took
photographs
of
the
planet
and
a
few
of
its
moons
but
were
low
in
resolution
the
quality
was
not
very
good


it
discovered
a
new
thin
ring
called
the
f
ring


it
also
discovered
that
the
dark
ring
gaps
appear
bright
when
viewed
towards
the
sun
which
shows
the
gaps
are
not
empty
of
material


the
spacecraft
measured
the
temperature
of
the
moon
titan


in
november
voyager
visited
saturn
and
took
higher
resolution
photographs
of
the
planet
rings
and
moons


these
photos
were
able
to
show
the
surface
features
of
the
moons


voyager
went
close
to
titan
and
gained
much
information
about
its
atmosphere


in
august
voyager
continued
to
study
the
planet


photos
taken
by
the
space
probe
showed
that
changes
were
happening
to
the
rings
and
atmosphere


the
<collocation>voyager spacecrafts</collocation>
discovered
a
number
of

orbiting
close
to
saturn
rings
as
well
as
discovering
new

drawing

on

the

entered

around

before
then
it
flew
close
to
phoebe
taking
very
high
resolution
photos
of
its
surface
and
collecting

on
december
the
probe
separated
from
the
probe
before
moving
down
towards
titan
surface
and
landed
there
on
january


it
landed
on
a
dry
surface
but
it
found
that
large
bodies
of
liquid
exist
on
the
moon


the
probe
continued
to
collect
data
from
titan
and
a
number
of
the
icy
moons


it
found
evidence
that
the
moon
had
water
erupting
from
its
geysers


also
proved
in
july
that
titan
had
<collocation>hydrocarbon lakes</collocation>
located
near
its
north
pole


in

it
discovered
a

the
power
of

was

astronomers

also

an
economic
system


in
it
some
people
must
work
for
no

these
people
are
called
slaves


there
is
evidence
that
even
before
there
was
writing
there
was
slavery


there
have
been
different
types
of
slavery
and
they
have
been
in
almost
all
cultures
and
continents


some
societies
had
laws
about
slavery
or
they
had
an
economy
that
was
built
on
it


during
the
century
almost
all
countries
made
laws
forbidding
slavery


the
universal
declaration
of
<collocation>human rights</collocation>
says
that
slavery
is
wrong


nevertheless
there
are
still
different
forms
of
slavery
in
some
countries


the
english
word
slave
comes
from
the
medieval
word
for
the
slavic
peoples
of
central
europe
and
eastern
europe
because
these
were
the
last
ethnic
group
to
be
captured
and
enslaved
in
central
europe


according
to
adam
smith
and
auguste
comte
a
slave
was
mainly
defined
as
a
captive

prisoner
of

millions
of
people
are
still
slaves
in
some
parts
of
the
world
mostly
in
south
asia
and
africa


it
is
less
common
in
the
developed
world
because
of
better
<collocation>law enforcement</collocation>
but
it
still
happens
there
as
well


the
ways
in
which
it
is
done
have
changed


today
slaves
may
work
because
of
things
like
a
high
debt
for
example
slaves
have
to
work
to
pay
off
a
debt


many
victims
are
told
that
their
families
will
be
harmed
if
they
report
the
slave
owners


many
slaves
are
forced
to
be
domestic
servants


in
some
cases
their
families
sell
them
to
the
slave
owners


some
slaves
have
been
trafficked
from
one
part
of
the
world
to
another


these
people
are
illegally
in
their
host
country
and
therefore
do
not
report
the
abuse


forced
prostitution
is
a
type
of
slavery


another
form
of
slavery
still
happening
today
is
forced
child
labor


some
children
have
to
work
in
mines
or
in
plantations
or
they
have
to
fight
wars
as
child
soldiers
for
no
pay


one
study
says
that
there
are
million
people
but
others
say
there
could
be
as
many
as
million
in

today

an
agitation

against

began
in
christian
countries
in
the
century


first
they
abolished
the

more

empire
stopped
slavery


several
other
countries
followed


in

disagreement
over
slavery
led
to
the
american

and
the
emancipation
proclamation


in
when
the

won
all

were
made
free


still
more

abolished

forced

continued

for

music
genre
soul
music
many
philosophies
and
religions
say
that
a
soul
is
the
part
of
a
living
human
being
which
is
supernatural
and
lives
after
death


it
can
not
be
discovered
by
science
because
it
can
not
be
tested
in
any
controlled
way


many
different
opinions
exist
as
to
what
happens
to
personal
experience
after
death


most
atheists
say
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
soul
and
that
the
body
is
the
only
part
of
a
person

soul
usually
means
deep

it
is
in
this
sense
that
the
word
appears
in
the
term
soul
music


however
that
music
was
also
influenced
by
gospel
music
which
was
religious


one
popular
idea
about
souls
that
is
easy
to
express
is
that
a
person
is
a
soul
and
has
a
body


the
soul
is
the
i
in
i

that
feels
and
lives

what
people

one
soul
started
this

other
souls
have
edited
it
and
another
soul
is
reading
it


this
view
however
implies
that
the
human
body
is
a
possession
and
seems
to
devalue
bodies
that
do
not
have
souls
as
defined
or
understood
by
the
speaker
some
people
say
that
animals
heretics
and
people
of
another
religion
do
not
have
souls


like
most
uses
of
the
verb
to
be
there
is
an
ideology
in
these
simple
words


christianity
teaches
that
all
humans
have
an
<collocation>immortal soul</collocation>


this
means
that
it
is
a
part
of
them
which
does
not
die
when
their
physical
body
dies
but
lives
on
with
them
to
heaven
or
to
hell


christians
believe
that
the
soul
is
the
breath
of
life
which
god
gave
to
adam


in
japan
the
soul
is
believed
to
weigh
grams


this
belief
may
have
been
influenced
by
the
observations
of
in
the
early


date
june
characteristics
one
distinction
often
made
is
between
soul
which
is
distinct
from
other
souls
and
spirit
which
may
be
combined
with
that
of
other
beings


the
idea
of
the
holy
spirit
in
christianity
for
example
is
a
universal
and
shared
spirit
many
souls
are
part
of
and
which
is
expressed
on
earth
in
that
faith
by
the
church
meaning
the
body
of
christ
meaning
all
bodies
that
follow
jesus


this
could
be
more
inclusive
than
the
view
of
souls
and
bodies


<collocation>reincarnation reincarnation</collocation>
is
a
belief
that
says
that
after
the
body
dies
the
soul
will
be
born
again

there
are
several
meanings
of
the
word
sense


this
page
is
for
there
are
more
detailed
articles
on
each
meaning
when
a
word
has
several
meanings
one
can
refer
to
it
as
being
used
in
the
sense
of
some
context
or
other


in
simple
english
for
instance
we
avoid
using
words
in
unusual
senses


the
sensory
system
of
animals
the
human
sensory
system
is
usually
said
to
have
six
senses
hearing
is
the
sense
of
sound
that
comes
into
our
ears


sight
is
the
sense
of
seeing
things
with
our
eyes


touch
is
the
sense
of
feeling
things
with
our
skin


taste
is
the
sense
of
the
flavor
of
things
with
our
tongue
smell
is
the
sense
of
smelling
things
with
our
noses


sense
is
knowing
where
your
whole
body
is
and
where
it
is
not


other
animals
may
have
other
senses


fish
have
lateral
lines
which
detect
changes
in
the
water
pressure
around
them
and
some
can
detect
changes
in
electric
fields
around
them


sense
in
language
sense
in
this
context
is
the
meaning
conveyed
by
language


another
use
is
to
flag
whether
an
argument
or
statement
is
correct
and
understood


that
makes
no
sense
or
that
is
nonsense
are
examples
from
everyday
speech


a
variation
of
this
is
to
say
that
something
does
not
make
economic
sense


usually
these
words
signal
a
political
dispute
or
some
failure
to
define
terms
correctly


the
term
<collocation>common sense</collocation>
is
thinking
based
on
a
wide
experience
of
life


it
used
to
mean
practical
wisdom


it
has
a
long
history
of
being
used
in
politics
often
to
mean
that
some
idea
will
be
accepted
or
rejected
