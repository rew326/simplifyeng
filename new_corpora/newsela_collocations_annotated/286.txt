and


people
like
bonsai
because
it
is
nice
to

and
because
it

fun

a

tree
can
live
for
a
very
long
time
longer
than

in

family
a
bonsai
might
be
started
by
a
grandparent
then
given
to
a
parent
then
given
to
a
child
over
many
years


a
bonsai
starts
with
a
small
tree


this
tree
can
be
grown
from
a
seed
or
can
be
found
already
growing
in
a
yard
or
a
park
or
the
forest


it
can
also
be
bought
from
a
plant
store


to
make
the
bonsai
the
small
tree
is
taken
out
of
the
ground


its
roots
are
carefully
cleaned
of
dirt


the
roots
may
be
trimmed
cut
a
little
to
help
them
fit
in
a
small
pot


the
branches
may
also
be
trimmed
to
make
the
tree
smaller


then
it
is
put
in
a
bonsai
pot
which
has
low
sides


fresh
soil
dirt
is
put
in
the
pot
to
cover
the

then
it
is
watered
and
put
outdoors
to

history
the
art
of
bonsai
began
in
japan
over
one
thousand
<collocation>years ago</collocation>


it
was
brought
to
japan
from
china
around
the
year


at
first
bonsai
were
planted
in
large
pots
like
the
chinese
used


but
the
japanese
later
put
them
in
very
low
almost
flat
pots


this
change
made
the
tree
itself
the
most
important
thing
in
the
art
form
not
the
<collocation>fancy pot</collocation>
or
small
houses
or
statues
of
people
which
other
nations
used
with
their
small
trees
in
pots


at
first
only
the
rich
and
noble
people
of
japan
had
bonsai


one
family
could
have
many
bonsai
which
would
grow
in
pots
in
the
garden
outside
of
the
house


a
servant
might
take
care
of
all
the
bonsai
and
would
learn
a
lot
about
how
to
grow
bonsai


the
rules
about
how
to
grow
a
bonsai
properly
were
not
well
known
and
were
not
shared
with
other
people


later
more
people
began
to
grow
bonsai


some
were
holy
people
like
monks


some
were
japanese
families
who
were
not
noble
or
really
rich
but
who
had
enough
money
and
time
to
grow
one
or
two
bonsai
in
their
gardens
or
house
yards


this
larger
group
of
people
began
to
share
what
they
learned
about
the
rules
of
bonsai
and
so
more
people
could
join
in
growing
bonsai


by
the
twentieth
century
the
rules
of
bonsai
were
very
well
known
in
japan
and
many
people
could
afford
to
grow
their
own
bonsai


cultivation
a
tree
that
could
be
used
for
bonsai
is
not
small
in
nature


if
left
to
grow
in
the
open
soil
a
bonsai
tree
would
grow
as
big
as
any
other
tree


but
in
a
pot
the
tree
will
not
grow
very
big


to
help
keep
it
small
the
owner
of
the
bonsai
trims
cuts
its
leaves
and
branches
every
year


every
two
or
three
years
the
bonsai
owner
lifts
the
bonsai
out
of
its
pot
and
trims
the
roots


then
the
owner
puts
the
bonsai
back
in
its
pot
with
some
new
soil


a
bonsai
grower
checks
the
soil
of
every
bonsai
pot
once
every
day


if
the
soil
is
nearly
dry
the
grower
waters
it
until
it
is
wet
from
the
top
of
the
soil
to
the
bottom
of
the
pot


every
few
weeks
the
grower
adds
a
little
fertilizer
to
each
bonsai
tree
soil


in
the
winter
this
happens
less
often


a
bonsai
can
live
to
be
older
than
a
large
tree
of
the
same
species
if
it
is
grown
with
care


a
bonsai
needs
good
care
and
a
bonsai
with
poor
care
will
not
be
healthy
and
might
die


to
keep
a
bonsai
strong
it
must
grow
outdoors
like
a
real
tree


it
must
never
get
too
dry
or
stay
too
wet


it
must
never
get
too
hot
or
too
cold


if
it
gets
a
plant
sickness
like
a
fungus
it
must
be
cured
quickly


if
it
gets
bugs
like
aphids
the
bugs
must
be
cleaned
off
or
killed
quickly


shapes
in
the
art
of
bonsai
a
sense
of
beauty
patience
and
good
care
are
all
needed


the
plant
the
shape
of
the
plant
as
well
as
the
arrangement
of
soil
and
the
kind
of
pot
used
are
important


each
bonsai
has
a
shape
partly
the
shape
and
direction
of
the
trunk
and
partly
the
shape
of
the
whole
tree
