of

there
are

the

and
the
republic
of
china
roc


claims
control
over
the
island
of
taiwan
which
is
also
known
as
taiwan
province
which
is
why
people
want
taiwan
to
formally
declare
independence


today
in
reality
the
government
controls
mainland
china
and
the
roc
government
governs
taiwan


the
government
has
never
occupied
taiwan


the
roc
government
occupied
mainland
china
from
to
before
losing
control
of
mainland
china
to
the
communist


today
people
who
live
in
taiwan
have
different
ideas


although
many
taiwanese
think
there
is
no
freedom
in
china
there
are
still
some
taiwanese
want
to
be
united
again
with
china


but
most
of
the
people
in
taiwan
want
to
keep
everything
like
it
is
now
independent
at
least
until
china
becomes
free


today
most
countries
of
the
world
recognize
the
people
republic
of
china
as
china


even
though
taiwan
is
not
recognized
by
the
un
as
a
sovereign
nation
most
countries
still
have
very
close
economic
and
cultural
relationship
with
taiwan


the
government
of
people
republic
of
china
has
said
that
if
the
people
of
taiwan
formally
vote
to
become
independent
they
will
invade
taiwan


so
there
is
now
a
situation
where
both
sides
are
not
making
any
big
changes
from
the
political
side
of
view


in
march
china
government
passed
a
law
called
the
law
that
will
allow
china
to
invade
taiwan
if
the
people
of
taiwan
vote
to
become
independent


this
law
hurt
the
feelings
of
the
people
in
taiwan
very
much
especially
since
the
government
of
china
has
never
ruled
taiwan
in
history


it
has
caused
even
more
people
in
taiwan
to
not
want
to
be
with
mainland
china

way
for
a
business
to
help
people

makes
from

a

can
be
a
name
word
phrase
symbol
logo
design
or
picture


it
can
only
be
used
on
things
made
by
the
business
that
owns
the
trademark


for
example
and
coke
are
trademark
names
for
a
certain
drink
made
by
the
company


no
other
business
can
use
these
names
or
any
names
similar
to
them


other
businesses
can
make
a
drink
that
is
similar
like
colas
soft
drinks
but
they
have
to
use
a
different
name
for
their
drink
such
as

another
example
is

the

according
to
the

in
the
bible
are
rules
for

given
by
god
to
moses

the

of

about

it
is
often
considered
to
have
been
a
different
name
for
the

place


the
rules
were
written
on
stone
tablets


these
rules
are
important
for
judaism
and
christianity


sometimes
these
rules
are
also
called
decalogue
from
greek
can
be
translated
as
ten
statements


the
name
decalogue
first
occurs
in
the
septuagint


the
jews
received
the
commandments
after
they
had
left
egypt
during
the
reign
of
pharaoh


there
are
different
texts
talking
about
the
commandments


most
of
them
are
in
the
bible
the
book
of
exodus
chapter
and
the
book
of
deuteronomy
chapter


the
qu
ran
mentions
the
tablets
but
does
not
list
the
commandments


because
the

has
been
translated

differences
in
teachings
and
interpretation
these
commandments
are
translated
from
ancient
hebrew
to
basic
english
so
the
exact
words
chosen
may
not
mean
to
us
exactly
what
they
meant
to
the
hebrews


there
are
a
variety
of
interpretations
of
these
commandments
images
the
creation
of
the
sun
and
the
moon
is
a
fresco
in
the
sistine
chapel


it
was
done
by
michelangelo


it
shows
an
image
of
god


one
understanding
on
the
commandment
to
not
make
any
image
or
any
likeness
of
any
thing
that
is
in
heaven
above
is
as
from
roman
catholicism
they
hold
that
likenesses
may
be
built
and
used
as
long
as
the
object
is
not
worshipped


the
eastern
orthodox
church
has
a
very
similar
position


<collocation>eastern orthodoxy</collocation>
teaches
that
the
incarnation
of
an
invisible
god
as
a
visible
human
jesus
makes
it
alright
to
worship
images
see


but
for
jews
muslims
and
most
other
christians
that
violates
the
commandment


jehovah
witnesses
criticize
the
use
of
all
of
the
above
as
well
as
the
use
of
the
cross


the
amish
forbid
any
sort
of
image
such
as
photos


sabbath
day
main
sabbath
shabbat
jews
honor
the
sabbath
shabbat
on
saturday
the
seventh
day
of
the
week
on
the
jewish
calendar


most
christians
honor
the
sabbath
on
sunday
to
remember
the
resurrection
of
jesus
on
the
first
day
of
the
week
on
the
jewish
calendar


some
conservative
christians
are
most
of
these
follow
the
<collocation>reformed traditions</collocation>


think
the
first
day
of
the
week
or
lord
day
is
the
new
sabbath
because
the
commandment
has
never
been
revoked
and
is
in
any
case
a
<collocation>creation ordinance</collocation>


others
believe
that
the
sabbath
remains
as
a
day
of
rest
on
saturday
while
sunday
as
a
day
of
worship
in
reference
to
acts
the
disciples
came
together
on
the
first
day
of
the
week
to
break
bread
and
to
hear
the
preaching
of
the
apostle
paul


also
jesus
appeared
to
his
followers
on
the
first
day
of
the
week
while
they
were
in
hiding


the
adventist
church
and
some
others
believe
that
the
custom
of
meeting
for
worship
on
sunday
originated
in
paganism
specifically
sol
and
in
which
sun
god
worship
took
place
on
sunday


instead
adventists
keep
saturday
as
the
sabbath
as
a
memorial
to
god
work
of
creation
believing
that
none
of
the
ten
commandments
can
ever
be
destroyed


claim
that
the
seventh
day
sabbath
was
kept
by
the
majority
of
christian
groups
until
the
and
century
but
because
of
opposition
to
judaism
after
the
wars
the
original
custom
was
gradually
replaced
by
sunday
as
the
day
of
worship


married
relations
to
be
false
to
the
married
relation
called
adultery
is
when
a
married
person
has
sexual
relations
with
a
person
other
than
his
or
her
spouse


the
bible
does
not
say
whether
or
not
this
includes
unmarried
people
having
sex
with
each
other
although
some
people
think
so


killing
or
murder
there
are
different
translations
of
this
commandment
the
hebrew
words
lang
he
are
translated
either
as
thou
shalt
not
kill
or
thou
shalt
not
murder


older
protestant
translations
of
the
bible
those
based
on
the
vulgate
and
roman
catholic
translations
usually
translate
it
thou
shalt
not
kill


jewish
and
newer
protestant
versions
tend
to
use
you
shall
not
murder


there
are
different
opinions
as
to
which
translation
is
more
faithful
to
the
original


the
many
examples
in
the
<collocation>old testament</collocation>
of
killing
sanctioned
by
god
are
quoted
in
defense
of
the
view
that
murder
is
more
accurate


furthermore
the
hebrew
word
for
kill
is
lang
he
while
the
hebrew
word
for
murder
is
lang
he
which
is
found
in
the
ten
commandments
lang
he
lo


in
the
new
testament
jesus
talked
about
who
was
guilty
of
breaking
these
commandments


he
said
that
even
if
someone
was
just
angry
and
rude
to
another
person
he
might

many
theologians
such
as
german
<collocation>old testament</collocation>
scholar
alt
das

suggest
that
commandment
you
shall
not
steal
was
originally
intended
against
stealing
people
abductions
and
slavery


this
would
be
the
same
as
the
jewish
interpretation
of
the
statement
as
you
shall
not
kidnap
as
stated
by


<collocation>false witness</collocation>
to
give
<collocation>false witness</collocation>

may
include

<collocation>different numbering</collocation>
the
bible
does
not
number
the
commandments


different
religious
groups
have
numbered
them
in
different
ways


the
jews
followed
by
christian
protestants
end
the
first
commandment
with
you
are
to
have
no
other
gods
but
me


catholics
and
lutherans
end
the
first
commandment
at
i
will
have
mercy
through
a
thousand
generations
on
those
who
have
love
for
me
and
keep
my
laws


and
separate
in
their
last
two
commandments
the
desire
for
a
man
wife
from
the
desire
for
other
things
he
owns


the
<collocation>commandments passage</collocation>
in
exodus
has
more
than
ten
important
statements
there
are
or
in
all


while
the
bible
itself
gives
the
count
as
using
the
hebrew
phrase
had
translated
as
the
words
statements
or
things
this
phrase
does
not
appear
in
the
passages
usually
presented
as
being
the
ten
commandments


various
religions
divide
the
commandments
differently

the
ritual
decalogue
the
term
ten
commandments
generally
applies
to
the
list
mentioned
in
exodus
and
deuteronomy


however
there
is
a
continuous
story
being
told
starting
in
exodus
where
the
stones
are
created
exodus
where
the
tablets
are
broken
and
exodus


this
story
lists
a
very
different
set
of
commandments


this
version
is
sometimes
called
ritual
decalogue


von
goethe
and
the
people
after
him
who
followed
the
documentary
hypothesis
note
that
exodus
seems
to
refer
to
these
ten
commandments
rather
than
the
traditional
ones


these
people
thought
that
the
commandments
in
exodus
and
deuteronomy
show
a
later
set
of
ten
commandments
and
that
the
ten
listed
in
exodus
were
the
original
ten
commandments
now
known
as
the
ritual
decalogue
as
opposed
to
the
ethical
decalogue


the
differences
between
the
two
highlight
the
development
of
sacred
texts
over
a
long
time
and
from
differing
<collocation>narrative traditions</collocation>
by
incorporating
two
differing
sets
of
ten
commandments


influence
the
commandments
have
influenced
jewish
ethics
and
law
and
through
judaism
and
christianity
western
ethics
and
law
since
the
roman
empire
