<collocation>compounds elements</collocation>
can
join

to

pure

organic
compounds


in

cases
these

have
a

their

sodium

when
they
react
together
they
make
<collocation>sodium chloride</collocation>

some
elements
particularly
metal
elements
mix
together
in

such

they
are

of
the

beheading
means
cutting

convict
head
off


it
is
one
of
the
oldest
execution
methods
and
already
mentioned
in
the
bible


beheading
used
to
be
the
standard
method
of
execution
in
scandinavia
and
germany


commoners
were
usually
beheaded
with
an
axe
and
noblemen
with
a
sword


a
special
device
like
guillotine
can
also
be
used
as
in
france


nazi
germany
used
guillotine
to
execute
criminal
convicts
such
as
murderers


centuries
ago
many
countries
used
beheading
as
an
execution
for
important
people
including
england


in
england
many
noblemen
and
even
some
kings
and
queens
have
been
beheaded


there
the
prisoner
would
be
led
up
the
scaffold
and
usually
say
a
speech


then
would
be
blindfolded
and
put
neck
onto
a
block


then
the
executioner
would
lift
up
his
axe
and
swing
it
down
onto
the
victim
neck


if
the
executioner
was
skilled
and
the
axe
was
sharp
then
the
axe
would
usually
cut
through
the
bone
and
organs
of
the
victim
in
one
stroke


but
if
the
executioner
was
inexperienced
then
it
may
take
many
strokes
before
the
head
would
be
cut
off


other
ways
of
execution
many
countries
do
not
allow
executions
as
punishment
any
more
because
it
is
too
violent


however
many
states

some

foreign

allow
it


even
in

less
violent

have

to
be
used

are
some
other
ways

other
than

killing

this

ways

hanging
using

either
break

neck
or
to
choke
him


widely
used

world
until

still
today
in

in
some
countries

as
iraq
singapore
and
japan


drawing
and
quartering
a
very
violent
form
of
execution
common
in

europe


it
involved
taking

while
he
was
still
alive
then
tying
him
to
four
horses
going
in
different
directions
until

similar
thing
is
breaking
on
the
wheel
when
a
wheel
rather
than
horses
is
used
to
tear
a
person
body
apart
this
method
means
literally
nailing
the
convict
on
a
cross


it
is
considered
as
the
most
painful
and
nasty
method
of
all


it
was
used
by
the
romans
to
punish
traitors
rebels
