history
although
there
were
a
number
of
natural
historians
in
the
century
who
had
some
idea
of
evolution
the
first
ideas
came
in
the
century


three
biologists
are
most
important


de
a
french
biologist
claimed
that
animals
changed
according
to
natural
laws


he
said
that
animals
could
pass
on
traits
they
had
acquired
during
their
lifetime
to
their
offspring
using
inheritance


today
his
theory
is
known
as


its
main
purpose
is
to
explain
adaptations
by
natural
means


he
proposed
a
tendency
for
organisms
to
become
more
complex
moving
up
a
ladder
of
progress
plus
use
and
disuse


idea
was
that
a
giraffe
neck
grew
longer
because
it
tried
to
reach
higher
up


this
idea
failed
because
it
can
not
be
reconciled
with
heredity
mendel
work


mendel
made
his
discoveries
about
half
a
century
after
work


<collocation>darwin variation</collocation>
charles
darwin
wrote
his
on
the
origin
of
species
in


in
this
book
he
put
forward
much
evidence
that
evolution
had
occurred


he
also
proposed
natural
selection
as
the
way
evolution
had
taken
place


but
darwin
did
not
understand
about
genetics
and
how
traits
were
actually
passed
on


he
could
not
accurately
explain
what
made
children
look
like
their
parents


nevertheless
darwin
explanation
of
evolution
was
fundamentally
correct


in
contrast
to
darwin
idea
was
that
the
giraffe
neck
became
longer
because
those
with
longer
necks
survived
better


these
survivors
passed
their
genes
on
and
in
time
the
whole
race
got
longer
necks


mendel
an
austrian
monk
called
gregor
mendel
bred
plants


in
the
century
he
discovered
how
traits
were
passed
on
from
one
generation
to
the
next


he
used
peas
for
his
experiments
some
peas
have
white
flowers
and
others
have
red
ones


some
peas
have
green
seeds
and
others
have
yellow
seeds


mendel
used
<collocation>artificial pollination</collocation>
to
breed
the
peas


his
results
are
discussed
further
in
mendelian
inheritance


darwin
thought
that
the
inheritance
from
both
parents
blended
together


mendel
proved
that
the
genes
from
the
two
parents
stay
separate
and
may
be
passed
on
unchanged
to
later
generations


mendel
published
his
results
in
a
journal
that
was
not
and
his
discoveries
were
overlooked


around
his
work
was
rediscovered


genes
are
bits
of
information
made
of
which
work
like
a
set
of
instructions


a
set
of
genes
are
in
every
living
cell


together
genes
organise
the
way
an
egg
develops
into
an
adult


with
mammals
and
many
other
living
things
a
copy
of
each
gene
comes
from
the
father
and
another
copy
from
the
mother


some
living
organisms
including
some
plants
only
have
one
parent
so
get
all
their
genes
from
them


these
genes
produce
the
genetic
differences
which
evolution
acts
on


darwin
theory
darwin
on
the
origin
of
species
has
two
themes
the
evidence
for
evolution
and
his
ideas
on
how
evolution
took
place


this
section
deals
with
the
second
issue


variation
the
members
of
this
family
are
similar
in
some
ways
different
in
others


the
flower
on
the
right
has
a
different
color


the
first
two
chapters
of
the
origin
deal
with
variation
in
domesticated
plants
and
animals
and
variation
in
nature


all
living
things
show
variation


every
population
which
has
been
studied
shows
that
animal
and
plants
vary
as
much
as
humans
do


this
is
a
great
fact
of
nature
and
without
it
evolution
would
not
occur


darwin
said
that
just
as
man
selects
what
he
wants
in
his
farm
animals
so
in
nature
the
variations
allow
natural
selection
to
work


the
features
of
an
individual
are
influenced
by
two
things
heredity
and
environment


first
development
is
controlled
by
genes
inherited
from
the
parents


second
living
brings
its
own
influences


some
things
are
entirely
inherited
others
partly
and
some
not
inherited
at
all


the
color
of
eyes
is
entirely
inherited
they
are
a
genetic
trait


height
or
weight
is
only
partly
inherited
and
the
language
is
not
at
all
inherited


just
to
be
clear
the
fact
that
humans
can
speak
is
inherited
but
what
language
is
spoken
depends
on
where
a
person
lives
and
what
they
are
taught


another
example
a
person
inherits
a
brain
of
somewhat
variable
capacity


what
happens
after
birth
depends
on
many
things
such
as
home
environment
education
and
other
experiences


when
a
person
is
adult
their
brain
is
what
their
inheritance
and
life
experience
have
made
it


evolution
only
concerns
the
traits
which
can
be
inherited
wholly
or
partly


the
hereditary
traits
are
passed
on
from
one
generation
to
the
next
through
the
genes


a
person
genes
contain
all
the
traits
which
they
inherit
from
their
parents


the
accidents
of
life
are
not
passed
on


also
of
course
each
person
lives
a
somewhat
different
life
that
increases
the
differences


organisms
in
any
population
vary
in
reproductive
success


from
the
point
of
view
of
evolution
reproductive
success
means
the
total
number
of
offspring
which
live
to
breed
and
leave
offspring
themselves


inherited
<collocation>variation variation</collocation>
can
only
affect
future
generations
if
it
is
inherited


because
of
the
work
of
gregor
mendel
we
know
that
much
variation
is
inherited


mendel
factors
are
now
called
genes


research
has
shown
that
almost
every
individual
in
a
sexually
reproducing
species
is
genetically
unique


genetic
variation
is
increased
by
gene
mutations


does
not
always
reproduce
exactly


rare
changes
occur
and
these
changes
can
be
inherited


many
changes
in
cause
faults
some
are
neutral
or
even
advantageous


this
gives
rise
to
genetic
variation
which
is
the
of
evolution


<collocation>sexual reproduction</collocation>
by
the
crossing
over
of
chromosomes
during
meiosis
spreads
variation
through
the
population


other
events
like
natural
selection
and
drift
reduce
variation


so
a
population
in
the
wild
always
has
variation
but
the
details
are
always
changing


natural
selection
main
natural
selection
evolution
mainly
works
by
natural
selection


what
does
this
mean


animals
and
plants
which
are
best
suited
to
their
environment
will
on
average
survive
better


there
is
a
struggle
for
existence


those
who
survive
will
produce
the
next
generation


their
genes
will
be
passed
on
and
the
genes
of
those
who
did
not
reproduce
will
not


this
is
the
basic
mechanism
which
changes
a
population
and
causes
evolution


natural
selection
explains
why
living
organisms
change
over
time
to
have
the
anatomy
the
functions
and
behavior
that
they
have


it
works
like
this
all
living
things
have
such
fertility
that
their
population
size
could
increase
rapidly
for
ever


we
see
that
the
size
of
populations
does
not
increase
to
this
extent


mostly
numbers
remain
about
the
same


the
food
and
other
resources
are
limited


therefore
there
is
competition
for
food
and
resources


no
two
individuals
are
alike


therefore
they
will
not
have
the
same
chances
to
live
and
reproduce


much
of
this
variation
can
be
inherited


parents
pass
such
traits
to
the
children
through
their
genes


the
next
generation
can
only
come
from
those
that
survive
and
reproduce


after
many
generations
of
this
the
population
will
have
more
helpful
genetic
differences
and
fewer
harmful
ones


natural
selection
is
really
a
process
of
elimination


the
elimination
is
being
caused
by
the
relative
fit
between
individuals
and
the
environment
they
live
in


selection
in
natural
populations
there
are
now
many
cases
where
natural
selection
has
been
proved
to
occur
in
wild
populations


almost
every
case
investigated
of
camouflage
mimicry
and
has
shown
strong
effects
of
selection


the
force
of
selection
can
be
much
stronger
than
was
thought
by
the
early
population
geneticists


the
resistance
to
pesticides
has
grown
quickly


resistance
to
warfarin
in
norway
rats
rattus
grew
rapidly
because
those
that
survived
made
up
more
and
more
of
the
population


research
showed
that
in
the
absence
of
warfarin
the
resistant
was
at
a
disadvantage
to
the
normal
wild
type


this
great
disadvantage
was
quickly
overcome
by
the
selection
for
<collocation>warfarin resistance</collocation>


mammals
normally
can
not
drink
milk
as
adults
but
humans
are
an
exception


milk
is
digested
by
the
enzyme
which
switches
off
as
mammals
stop
taking
milk
from
their
mothers


the
human
ability
to
drink
milk
during
adult
life
is
supported
by
a
mutation
which
prevents
this


human
populations
have
a
high
proportion
of
this
mutation
wherever
milk
is
important
in
the
diet


the
spread
of
this
milk
tolerance
is
promoted
by
natural
selection
because
it
helps
people
survive
where
milk
is
available


genetic
studies
suggest
that
the
oldest
mutations
causing
persistence
only
reached
high
levels
in
human
populations
in
the
last
ten
thousand
years


therefore
persistence
is
often
cited
as
an
example
of
recent
human
evolution


as
persistence
is
genetic
but

adaptation
main
adaptation
adaptation
is
one
of
the
basic
phenomena
of
biology


through
the
process
of
adaptation
an
organism
becomes
better
suited
to
its
habitat


adaptation
is
one
of
the
two
main
processes
that
explain
the
diverse
species
we
see
in
biology


the
other
is
or


a
favorite
example
used
today
to
study
the
interplay
of
adaptation
and
is
the
evolution
of
fish
in
african
rivers
and
lakes


when
people
speak
about
adaptation
they
often
mean
something
which
helps
an
animal
or
plant
survive


one
of
the
most
widespread
adaptations
in
animals
is
the
evolution
of
the
eye


another
example
is
the
adaptation
of
horses
teeth
to
grinding
grass


camouflage
is
another
adaptation
so
is
mimicry


the
better
adapted
animals
are
the
most
likely
to
survive
and
to
reproduce
successfully

an
<collocation>internal parasite</collocation>
such
as
a
fluke
is
a
good
example
it
has
a
very
simple
bodily
structure
but
still
the
organism
is
highly
adapted
to
its
particular
environment


from
this
we
see
that
adaptation
is
not
just
a
matter
of
visible
traits
in
such
<collocation>parasites critical</collocation>
adaptations
take
place
in
the
life
cycle
which
is
often
quite
complex


limitations
not
all
features
of
an
organism
are
adaptations


adaptations
tend
to
reflect
the
past
life
of
a
species


if
a
species
has
recently
changed
its
life
style
a
once
valuable
adaptation
may
become
useless
and
eventually
become
a
dwindling
vestige


adaptations
are
never
perfect


there
are
always
tradeoffs
between
the
various
functions
and
structures
in
a
body


it
is
the
organism
as
a
whole
which
lives
and
reproduces
therefore
it
is
the
complete
set
of
adaptations
which
gets
passed
on

the

explains
how
random
chance
can
affect
evolution
in
surprisingly
big
ways
but
only
when
populations
are
quite

overall
its
action
is
to
make

and
hence
more
vulnerable

although
the

has
rebounded
its
genetic
variability
is
much
less
than
that
of
the
southern
elephant
seal


cheetahs
have
very
little
variation


we
think
the
species
was
reduced
to
a
small
number
at
some
recent
time


because
it
lacks
genetic
variation
it
is
in

these
occur
when
a
small
group
buds
off
from
a
larger
population


the

then
lives
separately

the
human

often
quoted
as
having
been
through
such
stages


for
example
when

he

beetles


each

is
confined
to
a

of
the

coast

descend
from
the
<collocation>atlas mountains</collocation>
to
the
mediterranean


as
soon
as
one
crosses
a
river
a
different
but
closely
related
species
appears


he
wrote
later
a
new
species
will
only
arise
when
a
few
individuals
cross
the
limiting
borders
of
their
range
the
formation
of
a

race
will
never
succeed
without
a
long
continued
separation
of
the
colonists
from

other
members
of

was
an
early
account
of
the

<collocation>geographical separation</collocation>

thought
<collocation>geographical separation</collocation>
was
critical
was


the

two
types
look

of

live

and

most
of

day
underground


when
two
groups
that
started
the
same
become
different
enough
then
they
become
two
different
species


part
of
the
theory
of
evolution
is
that
all
living
things
started
off
the
same
but
then
split
off
into
different
groups
over
billions
of
years

worked

past


evolution
is
gradual
and
usually
takes
place
by
small
steps


there
are
some
exceptions
to
this
notably
especially
in
plants


natural
selection
the
struggle
for
existence
of
animals
and
plant
in
the
wild
causes
natural
selection


the
strength
of
natural
selection
in
the
wild
was
greater
than
even
darwin
expected


<collocation>genetic drift</collocation>
can
be
important
in
small
populations


the
rate
of
evolution
can
vary


there
is
very
good
evidence
from
fossils
that
different
groups
can
evolve
at
different
rates
and
that
different
parts
of
an
animal
can
evolve
at
different
rates


some

research
constancy
these
two
honeybees

selectively
visit
flowers
from
only
one
species
as
can
be
seen
by
the

where
the
existence
of

with
the
life
of
one
or
more
other
species
