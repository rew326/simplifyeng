history
of
money
money
is
what
you
use
to
buy
things


the
idea
of
trading
things
is
very
old


a
long
time
ago
people
did
not
buy
or
sell
with
money


instead
they
traded
one
thing
for
another
to
get
what
they
wanted
or
needed


one
person
who
owned
many
cows
could
trade
with
another
person
who
owned
much
wheat


each
would
trade
a
little
of
what
he
had
with
the
other
and
support
the
people
on
his
farm


this
is
known
as
barter


other
things
that
were
easier
to
carry
around
than
cows
also
came
to
be
held
as
valuable
and
were
used
as
trade
items
such
as
jewelry
and
spices


when
people
changed
from
trading
in
things
like
cows
and
wheat
to
using
money
instead
they
needed
things
that
would
last
a
long
time
still
have
a
known
value
and
could
be
carried
around


the
first
country
in
the
world
to
make
metal
coins
was
called
sometime
around
in
the
western
part
of
what
is
now
turkey


the
coins
were
made
of
a
weighed
amount
of
precious
metal
and
were
stamped
with
a
picture
of
a
lion


this
idea
soon
spread
to
greece
the
rest
of
the
mediterranean
and
the
rest
of
the
world


coins
were
all
made
to
the
same
size
and
shape


in
some
parts
of
the
world
different
things
have
been
used
as
money
like
clam
shells
or
blocks
of
salt


besides
being
easier
to
carry
than
cows
using
money
had
many
other
advantages


money
is
easier
to
divide
than
many
trade
goods


if
someone
own
cows
and
wants
to
trade
for
only
half
a
cow
worth
of
wheat
he
probably
does
not
want
to
cut
his
cow
in
half


but
if
he
sells
his
cow
for
money
and
buys
wheat
with
money
he
can
get
exactly
the
amount
he
wants


cows
die
and
wheat
rots


but
money
lasts
longer
than
most
trade
goods


if
someone
sells
a
cow
for
money
he
can
save
that
money
away
until
he
needs
it


he
can
always
leave
it
to
his
children
when
he
dies


it
can
last
a
very
long
time
and
he
can
use
it
at
any
time


not
every
cow
is
as
good
as
another
cow


some
cows
are
sick
and
old
and
others
are
healthy
and
young


some
wheat
is
good
and
other
wheat
is
moldy
or
stale


so
if
a
person
<collocation>trades cows</collocation>
for
wheat
he
might
have
a
hard
time
arguing
over
how
much
wheat
each
cow
is
worth


however
money
is
standard


that
means
one
dollar
is
worth
the
same
as
another
dollar


it
is
easier
to
add
up
and
count
money
than
to
add
up
the
value
of
different
cows
or
amounts
of
wheat


later
after
coins
had
been
used
for
hundreds
of
years
paper
money
started
out
as
a
promise
to
pay
in
coin
much
like
an
note


the
first
true
paper
money
was
used
in
china
between
and
and
paper
money
was
also
printed
in
sweden
between
and


both
times
it
did
not
work
well
and
had
to
be
stopped
because
the
banks
kept
running
out
of
coins
to
pay
on
the
notes


massachusetts
bay
colony
printed
paper
money
in
the
and
this
time
the
use
became
more
common


today
most
of
what
people
think
of
as
money
is
not
even
things
you
can
hold


it
is
numbers
in
bank
accounts
saved
in
computer
memories


many
people
still
feel
more
comfortable
using
coins
and
paper
and
do
not
totally
trust
using
electronic
money
on
a
computer
memory

multiplication
is
an
arithmetic
operation
for
finding
the
product
of
two
numbers


multiplication
is
the
third
operation
in
maths
after
addition
which
is
the
first
subtraction
which
is
the
second
and
then
there
is
multiplication


with
natural
numbers
it
tells
you
the
number
of
tiles
in
a
rectangle
where
one
of
the
two
numbers
equals
the
number
of
tiles
on
one
side
and
the
other
number
equals
the
number
of
tiles
on
the
other
side


with
real
numbers
it
tells
you
the
area
of
a
rectangle
where
the
first
number
equals
the
size
of
one
side
and
the
second
number
equals
the
size
of
the
other
side


for
example
three
multiplied
by
five
is
the
total
of
five
threes
added
together
or
the
total
of
three
fives


this
can
be
written
down
as
or
spoken
as
three
times
five
equals
fifteen


mathematicians
call
the
two
numbers
you
wish
to
multiply
coefficients
together
or
and
separately


multiplication
between
numbers
is
said
to
be
when
the
order
of
the
numbers
does
not
influence
the
value
of
the
product


this
is
true
for
the
integers
whole
numbers
is
the
same
as
and
also
for
the
<collocation>rational numbers</collocation>
fractions
and
for
all
the
other
real
numbers
as
a
field
in
the
continuous
line
and
also
for
complex
numbers
numbers
as
a
field
in
the
plane


it
is
not
true
for
numbers
as
a
ring
in
the
space
vectors
or
matrices


the
definition
of
multiplication
as
repeated
addition
provides
a
way
to
arrive
at
a
interpretation
of
multiplication
of
cardinal
numbers


a
more
accurate
representation
is
to
think
of
it
as
scaling
quantities


this
animation
illustrates
being
multiplied
by
giving
as
a
result


notice
that
the
blue
dot
in
the
blue
segment
of
length
is
placed
at
position
and
the
blue
segment
is
scaled
so
that
this
dot
is
placed
at
the
end
of
the
red
segment
of
length


for
multiplication
by
any
x
the
blue
dot
will
always
start
at
and
end
at
this
works
even
for
x
smaller
than
or
negative


the
opposite
of
multiplication
is
division
