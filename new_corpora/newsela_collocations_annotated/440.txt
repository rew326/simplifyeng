definition
the
word
pornography
comes
from
the
greek
words
meaning
prostitute
and
writing


the
word
was
first
used
for
stories
that
were
written
about
sex


the
word
pornography
is
now
used
for
photographs
and
other
pictures
movies
and
writing
that
are
about
sex


in
pornography
sex
is
the
most
important
thing


it
is
also
called
porn
or
porno
for
short


what
is
not
pornography
there
are
different
ideas
about
what
is
and
what
is
not
pornography


diana
russell
a
psychologist
says
that
there
is
a
difference
between
pornography
and
erotica


the
word
erotica
is
often
used
for
pictures
movies
or
stories
that
focus
on
the
beauty
of
sexuality


there
is
not
often
a
clear
difference
between
erotica
and
pornography


the
dispute
over
what
is
or
is
not
pornography
can
even
go
to
the
courts


some
people
believe
that
anything
that
shows
a
naked
body
is
a
type
of
pornography


the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
many
other
countries
do
not
support
this


there
can
be
all
sorts
of
reasons
for
showing
a
naked
or
partly
undressed
body


some
of
these
reasons
include
art
work
or
a
medical
diagram


types
of
pornography
pictures
that
show
models
in
a
sexy
pose
are
sometimes
called
soft
porn


there
are
different
kinds
of
pornography


the
term
soft
porn
is
sometimes
used
for
pictures
that
show
people
who
may
or
may
not
be
naked
but
who
are
posed
in
a
sexy
manner


pictures
of
women
like
this
are
sometimes
called
cheesecake
and
pictures
of
men
are
called
beefcake


<collocation>pornographic pictures</collocation>
or
movies
which
show
people
having
sex
are
sometimes
called
hard
porn


another
type
of
pornography
is
child
pornography


in
the
law
of
most
countries
people
are
children
until
they
reach
a
particular
age


any
movie
or
photo
that
show
a
person
who
is
a
child
by
law
being
used
for
a
sexual
act
is
considered
pornography
and
is
illegal


there
are
laws
to
protect
children
against
people
who
use
or
exploit
them
in
this
way


the
business
of
<collocation>pornography businesses</collocation>
have
been
making
pornography
for
many
years


until
the
businesses
making
pornography
were
small
because
there
were
many
laws
against
it


in
the
pornographic
magazines
such
as
penthouse
became
a
huge
and
successful
business


pornography
movies
also
become
popular
at
this
time


in
the
the
creation
of
the
<collocation>video cassette</collocation>
recorder
caused
a
rise
in
the
pornography
business


a
number
of
companies
began
making
pornographic
videotapes
in
the
united
states


in
the
as
more
people
began
using
the
internet
businesses
began
selling
<collocation>pornographic pictures</collocation>
on
the
internet


in
the
the
increased
speed
of
computers
allowed
pornography
companies
to
sell
<collocation>porn videos</collocation>
over
the
internet


the
pornography
brand
was
the
first
website
that
such
items


there
are
many
different
kinds
of
businesses
that
make
and
sell
pornography


there
are
magazines
such
as
playboy
and
hustler


movie
companies
such
as
vivid
video
<collocation>hire pornography</collocation>
actors
and
produce
videos


there
are
also
thousands
of
web
sites
that
make
and
sell
porn


businesses
that
make
pornography
call
themselves
adult
entertainment
businesses


pornography
and
the
law
in
many
countries
it
is
a
serious
crime
to
make
pornographic
photographs
of
children


this
is
called
child
porn


in
the
united
states
there
are
laws
that
say
that
anyone
who
takes
pornographic
photos
must
keep
records
that
prove
the
ages
of
the
people
in
the
pictures
are
over


in
many
countries
such
as
india
indonesia
iran
and
pakistan
making
or
owning
pornography
is
a
crime


however
in
some
cultures
such
as
western
european
nations
and
the
us
making
or
owning
pornography
is
legal


it
is
legal
as
long
as
all
of
the
people
in
the
pornography
are
older
than
a
certain
age


it
must
also
be
sold
to
people
above
a
certain
age


often
this
age
is
years


the
netherlands
have
very
liberal
laws
about
pornography


many
cities
or
towns
have
rules
about
where
pornographic
videos
or
magazines
can
be
sold
and
on
how
these
videos
or
magazines
can
be
displayed


for
example
some
towns
in
canada
require
pornographic
video
packages
to
be
kept
out
of
sight
of
children


criticism
of
pornography
since
the
many
women
groups
and
feminist
writers
have
criticized
pornography
especially
hardcore
pornography


women
groups
and
feminist
writers
have
argued
that
hardcore
pornography
shows
women
in
degrading
or
humiliating
positions


some
psychologists
who
have
talked
with
many
people
who
are
in
jail
for
violent
sex
crimes
believe
that
pornography
that
shows
violent
sex
often
makes
people
less
caring
about
the
feelings
of
other
people


this
might
make
them
more
likely
to
commit
rape
and
other
sex
crimes


many
pedophiles
who
sexually
assault
children
also
have
collections
of
child
pornography


pornography
is
often
criticised
by
religious
people
and
churches
who
believe
that
it
is
unholy


many
parents
do
not
wish
their
children
to
see
pornography


special
computer
programs
can
be
installed
on
computers
to
block
access
to
some
websites
including
websites
that
have
pornography


in
the
novel
nineteen
by
george
orwell
pornography
is
described
as
a
tool
that
is
secretly
pushed
by
some
evil
governments


the
governments
believe
it
is
a
force
that
makes
the
public
less
likely
to
rebel
or
even
to
care
about
injustice


other
problems
with
pornography
many
countries
have
laws
against
child
pornography


these
laws
say
that
people
younger
than
a
certain
age
may
not
be
involved
in
making
pornography


there
are
problems
however
with
the
internet
it
can
be
very
hard
to
say
if
a
person
involved
in
pornography
is
really
a
child
or
if
they
are
an
adult
pretending
to
be
one


also
<collocation>organized crime</collocation>

money
from
trafficking
human
beings
often
girls
and
women
who
are
trafficked
are
forced
into
prostitution


they
are
sometimes
also
forced
to
make
pornography


truth
an
oil

the
museum
in
paris

nakedness

particularly
if
the
person
genitals
or
a
woman
nipples
can
be
seen
even
if
other
parts
of
the
body
are
covered


nudity
can
also
mean
that
a
person
is
wearing
less
clothing
that
other
people
would
expect


this
type
of
nudity
is
related
to
culture


people
of
different
cultures
wear
different
amounts
of
clothing
and
keep
different
parts
of
the
body
covered


for
some
people
nudity
is
a
lifestyle
belief
system
or
a
default
state
of
being
which
is
called
or
nudism


the
word

what

influences
on
people
ideas
about
nudity
there
are
several
things
that
affect
how
people
and
societies
feel
about
nudity
the
gender
of
the
nude
person
the
age
of
the
nude
person
the
body
of
the
nude
person
where
the
nude
person
is
what
the
person
is
doing
while
they
are
nude
whether
the
nude
person
is
alone
or
with
other
people
the
age
and
gender
of
the
person
who
sees
the
nudity
modesty
in
most
cultures
it
is
normal
to
keep
parts
of
the
body
covered


the
feeling
that
a
person
has
about
covering
their
body
is
called
modesty


modesty
is
different
in
different
cultures


often
people
feel
shame
if
their
body
is
not
covered
to
match
their
culture
idea
of
modesty


the
amount
of
clothing
needed
to
take
away
the
feeling
of
shame
is
different
for
each
culture


with
some
<collocation>indigenous peoples</collocation>
like
the
a
piece
of
string
is
enough
to
make
that
feeling
go
away


in
some
cultures
people
nearly
always
keep
their
bodies
covered


in
these
cultures
nudity
is
only
normal
when
a
person
is
alone
for
example
dressing
or
bathing


in
other
cultures
it
is
quite
normal
for
people
to
be
naked
together
for
example
when
dressing
or
swimming


in
still
other
cultures
particularly
indigenous
ones
people
wear
very
few
clothes
and
complete
nudity
is
normal


even
with
people
from
the
same
culture
different
people
can
have
different
feelings
about
nudity


some
people
in
western
culture
for
example
the
united
states
do
not
mind
if
a
family
member
sees
them
naked
in
the
bath


other
people
from
the
same
culture
would
be
uncomfortable
if
anyone
saw
them
naked
in
the
bath


some
women
in
a
western
culture
are
happy
to
wear
a
bikini


other
women
feel
naked
in
a
bikini
and
always
wear
a
swimsuit


rules
women
who
swim
topless
in
the
us
often
use
pasties
to
cover
their
nipples


many
societies
have
rules
or
laws
about
nudity
and
where
they
allow
it


for
example
in
some
societies
the
law
allows
nudity
on
a
beach
but
does
not
allow
nudity
in
a
public
street


the
same
sort
of
laws
can
also
allow
people
to
be
partly
naked
in
some
places
but
not
in
others
for
example
women
might
be
allowed
to
have
naked
breasts
on
the
beach
but
not
in
a
shopping
center


when
a
woman
uncovers
her
breasts
on
the
beach
this
is
called
toplessness
because
her
swimsuit
is
topless


this
is
allowed
in
many
parts
of
europe
and
australia


in
many
other
countries
it
is
not
allowed


the
rules
about
dress
and
nudity
may
be
set
by
a
government
or
by
a
church
or
some
other
organization


for
example
in
some
christian
churches
a
woman
must
cover
her
shoulders
and
a
man
must
not
have
bare
legs


another
example
is
in
many
schools
a
man
must
wear
a
jacket
over
his
shirt
and
a
woman
must
wear
a
dress
that
has
sleeves


another
example
is
that
some
hotels
that
are
near
beaches
will
not
serve
customers
who
are
dressed
only
in
swimsuits


some
countries
have
very
strict
laws
about
whether
a
person
can
be
nude
in
public
and
what
parts
of
the
body
can
be
shown


in
many
countries
if
a
person
breaks
these
laws
they
can
be
charged
with
indecency
which
means
that
they
have
acted
in
a
rude
way
that
upsets
people


for
example
if
a
man
took
his
trousers
off
near
a
school
so
that
the
children
would
see
him
he
would
be
charged
with
indecency


the
reason
why
a
person
is
nude
affects
whether
the
law
says
that
their
nudity
is
indecent


<collocation>functional nudity</collocation>
a
man
showering
<collocation>functional nudity</collocation>
is
when
a
person
is
nude
for
a
reason


even
where
nudity
is
generally
not
allowed
<collocation>functional nudity</collocation>
often
is


an
example
of
this
is
when
a
person
at
the
beach
changes
from
a
<collocation>wet swimsuit</collocation>
to
their
dry
clothes


often
the
person
who
is
changing
can
use
a
towel
so
that
other
people
do
not
see
their
nudity
and
do
not
become
embarrassed
or
angry


another
type
of
<collocation>functional nudity</collocation>
happens
when
a
woman
is
breastfeeding
in
public


a
woman
who
would
not
usually
show
her
breasts
because
of
modesty
might
be
quite
happy
to
show
her
breast
while
she
is
feeding
her
baby


<collocation>sex segregation</collocation>
in
some
countries
<collocation>functional nudity</collocation>
is
usual
for
people
of
different
genders
in
some
places


an
example
is
in
a
<collocation>public sauna</collocation>


in
many
cultures
<collocation>functional nudity</collocation>
is
usual
in
front
of
people
of
the
same
sex


places
where
<collocation>functional nudity</collocation>
happens
such
as
public
toilets
or
changing
rooms
are
usually
separated
by
gender


there
is
one
for
men
and
another
one
for
women


in
many
cultures
it
is
usual
for
people
of
the
same
sex
to
undress
or
take
a
shower
in
a
public
change
room


in
some
cultures
such
as
japan
open
showers
and
<collocation>open urinals</collocation>
in
men
toilets
are
not
allowed


western
culture
venus
by
the
elder
among
people
of
western
culture
around
the
world
there
are
several
influences
on
the
way
societies
feel
about
nudity


in
european
society
it
is
not
usual
for
older
children
or
adults
to
be
completely
nude
in
public


in
most
european
societies
when
people
swim
in
public
they
cover
their
genitals
and
women
also
cover
their
breasts


in
most
european
societies
change
rooms
and
toilets
are
separated
for
men
and
women


countries
in
southern
europe
where
the
catholic
church
is
very
important
as
well
as
countries
which
have
been
affected
by
puritanism
usually
have
a
lower
tolerance
towards
nudity
in
public


countries
in
central
europe
and
scandinavia
care
less
about
public
nudity


or
nudism
is
a
cultural
and
political
movement


followers
of
this
movement
think
that
nudity
should
get
a
higher
value
both
in
the
private
as
well
as
the
public
context


it
is
also
a
lifestyle
based
on
personal
family
social
nudity


reject
current
standards
of
modesty


these
discourage
people
from
being
naked
alone
in
the
family
or
at
social
occasions
they
say


they
want
to
create
a
social
environment
where
people
feel
comfortable
in
the
company
of
nude
people
and
do
not
