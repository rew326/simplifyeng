minerals

minerals
are
usually
solid
inorganic
have
a
<collocation>crystal structure</collocation>
and
happen
naturally

the
study
of
minerals
is
called
mineralogy


a
mineral
can
be
made
of
single
<collocation>chemical element</collocation>
or
more
usually
a
compound


there

over
types

one
recent
definition
is
a
mineral
is
a
homogeneous
naturally
occurring
substance
with
a
definite
but
not
necessarily
fixed
chemical
composition


most
minerals
are
solids
with
an
ordered
atomic
arrangement
and
most
are
inorganic
in
the
chemical
sense
of
that
word


alternatively
a
mineral
is
one
listed
as
such
by
the
international
association


minerals
and
rocks
minerals
are
different
from
rocks


a
mineral
is
a
chemical
compound
with
a
given
composition
and
a
defined
<collocation>crystal structure</collocation>


a
rock
is
a
mixture
of
one
or
several
minerals
in
varying
proportions


a
rock
has
only
two
of
the
characteristics
minerals
have
it
is
a
solid
and
it
forms
naturally


a
rock
usually
contains
two
or
more
types
of
minerals


two
samples
of
the
same
type
of
rock
may
have
different
kinds
of
minerals
in
them


minerals
are
always
made
up
of
the
same
materials
in
nearly
the
same
proportions


a
ruby
is
a
mineral


therefore
a
ruby
found
in
india
has
similar
makeup
as
a
ruby
found
in
australia


formed
in
nature
minerals
are
formed
by
natural
processes


a
few
substances
with
the
same
chemical
composition
as
minerals
can
be
produced
by
living
creatures
as
part
of
their
shells
or
bones


the
shells
of
molluscs
are
composed
of
either
calcite
or
aragonite
or
both


traditionally
chemicals
produced
by
living
things
are
not
considered
minerals


however
it
is
difficult
to
see
why
an
organic
substance
should
not
be
called
a
mineral
if
its
chemical
nature
and
its
crystalline
structure
is
identical
with
its
<collocation>inorganic twin</collocation>

many
types
of
minerals
are
made
when
molten
rock
or
magma
cools
and
turns
into
a
solid


talc
a
mineral
that
can
be
used
to
make
baby
powder
forms
deep
in
earth
as
high
pressure
and
temperature
causes
changes
in
solid
rock


the
extraordinary
thing
is
that
most
minerals
owe
their
formation
to
life
or
at
least
to
the
great
oxygenation
event


sturdy
minerals
rather
than
<collocation>fragile organic</collocation>
remains
may
provide
the
most
robust
and
lasting
signs
of
biology


solid
a
mineral
is
a
solid
that
is
it
has
a
definite
volume
and
a
rough
shape


volume
refers
to
the
amount
of
space
an
object
takes
up


for
example
a
golf
ball
has
a
smaller
volume
than
a
baseball
and
a
baseball
has
a
smaller
volume
than
a
basketball


corundum
by
rob
a
substance
that
is
a
liquid
or
a
gas
is
not
a
mineral


however
in
some
cases
its
solid
form
is
a
mineral


for
instance
liquid
water
is
not
a
mineral

is

properties
<collocation>crystal structure</collocation>
the
particles
of
ice
that
make
up
frost
have
smooth
flat
surfaces


these
flat
surfaces
form
because
of
the
arrangement
of
atoms
in
the
ice
which
is
a
mineral


such
an
internal
arrangement
is
a
characteristic
of
minerals


it
is
the
structure
of
a
crystal
a
solid
in
which
the
atoms
are
arranged
in
an
orderly
repeating
pattern


each
mineral
has
its
own
type
of
<collocation>crystal structure</collocation>


in
some
cases
two
minerals
have
the
same
chemical
composition
but
different
crystal
structures


for
example
both
diamond
and
graphite
consist
of
just
one
element
carbon


but
the
arrangements
of
the
carbon
atoms
in
these
two
minerals
are
not
the
same
so
they
have
different
crystal
structures
and
very
different
properties


diamonds
are
extremely
hard
and
have
a
brilliant
sparkle


graphite
is
soft
gray
and
dull


in
nature
a
perfect
crystal
is
rare


most
crystals
have
<collocation>imperfect shapes</collocation>
because
their
growth
was
limited
by
other
crystals
forming
next
to
them


chemical
properties
<collocation>definite chemical</collocation>
makeup
each
mineral
has
a
<collocation>definite chemical</collocation>
makeup
it
consists
of
a
specific
combination
of
atoms
of
certain
elements


an
element
is
a
substance
that
contains
only
one
type
of
atom


scientists
can
classify
minerals
into
groups
on
the
basis
of
their
chemical
makeup


though
there
are
thousands
of
different
minerals
only
about
are
common
in
earth
crust


these
minerals
make
up
most
rocks
in
the
crust


for
that
reason
they
are
called
minerals


silicates
the
most
common
group
is
the
silicates


all
the
minerals
in
this
group
contain
oxygen
and
silicon
the
two
most
common
elements
in
earth
crust
joined
together


they
may
include
other
elements
such
as
aluminium
magnesium
iron
and
calcium


quartz
feldspar
and
mica
are
common
silicates


the
second
most
common
group
of
minerals
is
the


all
the
minerals
in
this
group
contain
carbon
and
oxygen
joined
together


calcite
which
is
common
in
seashells
is
a
carbonate
mineral


there
are
many
other
mineral
groups


the
mineral
group
known
as
oxides
contains
the
minerals
from
which
most
metals
such
as
tin
and
copper
are
refined


an
oxide
consists
of
an
element
usually
a
metal
joined
to
oxygen


this
group
includes
a
source
of
iron


sulphates
by
rob
these
contain
the
sulphate
group
so


sulphates
commonly
form
in
where
highly
<collocation>salty waters</collocation>
slowly
evaporate
allowing
and
to
precipitate
where
the
water
evaporates


sulphates
also
occur
where
hot
waters
are
forced
through
the
rock
as
with
geysers


some
uses
of
minerals
people
use
minerals
for
many
everyday
purposes


every
time
people
turn
on
a
microwave
oven
or
a
tv
minerals
are
being
used


the
copper
in
the
wires
that
carry
electricity
to
the
object
is
a
mineral


table
salt
or
is
another
mineral
that
people
use
in
their
everyday
life


graphite
is
used
to
make
pencil
rock
salt

a

when
