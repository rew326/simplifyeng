people
with
schizophrenia
have
been
shown
to
have
problems
that
affect
these
neural
networks


substance
abuse
several
drugs
have
been
linked
with
the
development
of
schizophrenia
and
the
abuse
of
certain
drugs
and
can
cause
symptoms
like
those
of
schizophrenia


about
half
of
those
people
who
have
schizophrenia
use
drugs
or
alcohol
excessively
possibly
as
coping
mechanisms
to
deal
with
depression
anxiety
boredom
or
loneliness


frequent
marijuana
use
has
been
linked
to
twice
the
risk
of
<collocation>serious mental</collocation>
illness
and
schizophrenia


smoking
more
people
with
schizophrenia
smoke
than
the
general
population
it
is
estimated
that
at
least
to
as
much
as
of
people
with
schizophrenia
smoke


recent
research
suggests
that
cigarette
smoking
may
be
a
risk
factor
for
developing
schizophrenia


<collocation>factors factors</collocation>
such
as
<collocation>oxygen deprivation</collocation>
infection
or
stress
and
lack
of
healthy
foods
in
one
mother
during
pregnancy
might
result
in
a
slight
increase
in
the
risk
of
schizophrenia
later
in
life


people
who
have
schizophrenia
are
more
likely
to
have
been
born
in
winter
or
spring
at
least
in
the
northern
half
of
the
world


this
might
relate
to
increased
rates
of
exposures
to

before

this

lateral
ventricles
in
schizophrenia


people
who
have
schizophrenia
have
differences
in
their
brain
structure
compared
to
those
who
do
not
have
the
disorder


these
differences
are
often
in
the
parts
of
the
brain
that
manage
memory
organization
emotions
the
control
of
impulsive
behavior
and
language


among
these
structural
differences
are
a
reduction
in
brain
volume
in
the
frontal
cortex
and
temporal
lobes
and
problems
within
the
corpus
the
band
of
<collocation>nerve fibers</collocation>
which
connects
the
left
side
and
the
right
side
of
the
brain


people
with
schizophrenia
also
tend
to
have
enlarged
lateral
and
third
ventricles


the
ventricles
are
spaces
within
the
brain
filled
with
cerebrospinal
fluid


brain
wiring
the
human
brain
has
billion
neurons
each
one
of
these

are
connected
to

other

may
have
as
many
as
connections
there
is
between

and

<collocation>neural connections</collocation>
in
the
adult
human
brain


there
are
many
different
parts
or
regions
of
the
brain


to
complete
a
task
like
recalling
a
memory
usually
more
than
one
region
of
the
brain
is
involved
and
they
are
connected
by
neural
networks
which
is
like

it
is
believed
that
there
are
problems
with
the
brain
wiring
in
schizophrenia


clear
diagnosis
the
tr
or
the
criteria
are
used
to

has

these
criteria
use
the
experiences
of
the
person
and
reported
abnormalities
in
the
behavior
of
the

followed
by
a

a
person
can
be

to
have
the

only
if

classification

<collocation>mental disorders</collocation>
between
dementia
praecox
and
mood
disorder
termed
<collocation>manic depression</collocation>
and
including
both
and
bipolar
depression


believed
that
dementia
praecox
was
primarily
a
disease
of
the
brain
and
a
form
of
dementia
different
from
other
forms
of
dementia
such
as
alzheimer
disease
which
usually
happen
later
in
life


coined
the
term
schizophrenia
which
translates
roughly
as

in


the
word
was
intended
to
describe
the
separation
of
functioning
between
personality
thinking

realized
that
the
illness
was
not
a
dementia
because
some
of
his
patients
improved
rather
than
got
worse


in
the
early
the
criteria
for
determining
schizophrenia
were
the
subject
of
<collocation>numerous controversies</collocation>


schizophrenia
was
diagnosed
far
more
often
in
the
united
states
than
in

this
difference
was
partly
the
result

criteria

had

the
manual
was
used


in

the
manual
was
used


a
study
published
in

science
concluded
that
the
diagnosis

in

was
often
unreliable


these
factors
resulted
in
the
publication

the
idea
that
the
disease
is
caused
by

inspired
the

or
bad
sometimes
