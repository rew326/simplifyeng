death
of
humans
is
often
investigated
for
the
cause
in
case
of
crime
such
as
murder
or
disease
that
may
continue
to
kill
other
humans


about
people
die
every
day
around
the
world


about
two
thirds
of
these
people
die
because
of
age


in
addition
to
the
physical
body
some
believe
humans
also
have
a
soul
and
believe
that
the
soul
can
continue
without
a
body
afterlife
move
into
another
body
reincarnation
or
cease
to
exist


religions
have
different
beliefs
about
this
issue


many
cultures
have
their
own
customs
and
rituals
to
respect
the
dead


when
people
talk
about
things
or
events
that
lead
to
the
death
of
a
plant
or
animal
those
things
or
events
are
usually
described
as
being
deadly
or
fatal


in
the
case
of
diseases
they
are
described
as
terminal


humans
are
no
different
from
any
other


our
bodies
have
an
ability
for
but
that
ability
is
limited


finding
the
cause
of
death
is
a
<collocation>medical speciality</collocation>
called
pathology


in
medicine
death
is
when
the
heart
stops
beating
for
more
than
several
minutes


there
are
special
times
in
which
people
recover
even
though
the
heart
has
stopped
for
minutes
such
as
in
very
cold
water


if
machines
are
used
to
help
the
heart
and
lungs
work
then
the
moment
of
death
is
more
difficult
to
know

society
and
culture

bodies
and

property
religious
views

death
rituals
surrounding
death
preparing
for
death
references
society
and
culture
dead
bodies
can
be
mummified
either
naturally
or
by
intention


in
any
society
human
death
is
surrounded
by
ritual
a
wake
or
funeral
is
normal


in
some
places
it
was
common
to
eat
the
dead
in
a
form
of
<collocation>ritual cannibalism</collocation>


but
this
is
no
longer
common
in
part
because
disease
like
kuru
can
be
passed
this
way


human
dead
bodies
are
taboo
in
most
societies
and
must
be
handled
in
special
ways
for
a
combination
of
religious
and
hygiene
reasons


a
human
dead
body
must
always
be
reported
in
law
to
be
sure
it
is
disposed
of
properly


dealing
with
dead
bodies
and
their
property
finding
the
cause
of
any
human
death
and
stopping
a
similar
death
from
happening
to
someone
else
are
the
main
reasons
people
look
into
human
morbidity
or
let
dead
bodies
be
cut
open
and
looked
at
in
an
autopsy


some
religions
do
not
allow
autopsies
because
they
feel
the
body
is
holy


autopsies
are
usually
required
by
the
state
if
someone
dies
and
people
do
not
know
why


the
autopsy
helps
find
out
if
someone
killed
the
person
on
purpose
tried
to
hurt
them
or
if
they
died
from
a
sickness


to
prepare
for
their
own
death
humans
can
write
a
last
will
and
testament
to
be
clear
about
who
gets
their
property


a
person
will
sometimes
also
volunteer
to
be
an
organ
donor


this
might
mean
giving
the
whole
body
to
medical
research


it
can
also
save
the
lives
of
others
by
making
organ
transplants
possible


religious
views
of
death
for
a
long
time
many
people
have
been
afraid
of
death
and
a
lot
of
people
have
wondered
about
what
may
happen
to
people
after
they
die


this
is
one
of
the
largest
questions
of
philosophy
and
religion


many
people
believe
there
is
some
form
of
afterlife


ancient
rulers
sometimes
did
insist
not
only
that
their
own
bodies
and
much
property
but
even
their
servants
and
relatives
be
destroyed
at
their
funeral


in
india
this
ritual
still
does
sometimes
occur


old
women
sometimes
carry
guns
in
case
their
husband
relatives
come
to
throw
them
on
the
funeral
fire


christianity
has
a
special
focus
on
death
because
of
the
state
killing
of
<collocation>jesus christ</collocation>
by
the
romans


in
islam
this
is
thought
to
demonstrate
the
injustice
of
human
systems
of
dealing
out
death
and
the
ability
of
the
best
people
to
overcome
it
and
even
forgive
it
fact
date
march


in
christianity
itself
it
is
thought
to
prove
that
jesus
himself
was
really
god
and
so
could
lose
his
body
and
still
have
the
power
of
resurrection


in
buddhism
reincarnation
is
believed
to
occur


reincarnation
is
an
idea
taken
from
hinduism


confucianism
advises
respect
for
parents
and
forms
of
ancestor
worship
to
respect
both
dead
and
living
ancestors


rituals
surrounding
death
every
<collocation>ethical tradition</collocation>
including
the
medical
view
of
the
body
has
some
ritual
surrounding
death


often
these
excuse
behaviors
that
might
be
hated
if
they
did
not
have
the
ritual


for
instance
one
may
say
that
<collocation>organ transplant</collocation>
is
like
cannibalism


very
much
of
what
happens
at
a
human
death
is
ritual


people
who
wish
theirs
to
be
dealt
with
a
certain
way
and
who
wish
a
particular
treatment
like
cremation
of
their
body
should
decide
in
advance
and
set
up
the
<collocation>necessary payments</collocation>
and
agreements


this
makes
it
much
easier
for
their
family
after
they
die
since
there
is
no
longer
the
ability
to
clearly
communicate
the
wish


for
the
same
reason
saying
goodbye
is
important


most
of
the
stress
of
death
seems
to
come
for
loved
ones
who
did
not
have
a
chance
to
say
goodbye


maybe
it
is
to
relieve
this
stress
that
rituals
are
created
and
to
bring
together
those
that
knew
someone
so
that
the
personal
experience
a
person
can
no
longer
communicate
for
themselves
can
be
exchanged
by
others


some
ritual
such
as
seances
claim
to
allow
people
to
speak
to
the
dead


this
is
not
claimed
to
be
very
reliable
both
by
scientists
and
even
by
those
who
do
them
very
often


preparing
for
death
aside
from
wills
goodbyes
<collocation>organ donations</collocation>
and
funerals
there
is
important
personal
experience
to
decide
to
pass
on
or
not
when
someone
knows
they
may
soon
die


palliative
care
focuses
on
basic
decisions
people
make
when
they
are
very
close
to
the
end
of
their
lives
and
it
ensures
someone
is
always
available
to
talk
to
them


it
is
a
replacement
for
heroic
medical
intervention
that
may
keep
them
physically
alive
but
with
no
quality
of
life


human
psychology
must
prepare
for
death
if
it
is
anything
other
than
a
quick
surprise
elizabeth
wrote
that
there
were
several
stages
in
dying
of
which
denial
was
the
first
and
acceptance
was
the
last


recording
one
life
is
often
something
people
with
acceptance
will
do
to
leave
a
memoir
or
a
full
autobiography
because
events
leave
living
memory
and
may
only
be
part
of
oral
tradition
there
are
projects
to
record
everything
that
people
remember
about
<collocation>world war</collocation>
i
and
the


the
first
of
these
was
to
record
everything
remembered
about
the
civil
war


this
discipline
has
changed
history
since
we
have
so
many
more
first
person
accounts
of
the
times
and
made
social
history
much
more
standard


a
engine
burns
diesel
or
fuel


however
rather
than
use
this
energy
directly
to
run
gears
it
charges
a
battery
which
more
efficiently
turns
wheels


some
designs
also
store
braking
energy
in
a
flywheel
which
can
also
charge
a
battery


however
these
make
the
engine
even
more
complex
and
add
weight
to
the
vehicle
so
are
more
appropriate
for
city
driving
where
service
stations
are
always
available
and
there
is
much
stop
and
go
driving


because
they
do
not
require
any
change
or
investment
in
stations
nor
much
in
vehicle
design
vehicles
are
believed
to
be
the
most
likely
replacement
for
today

is
thought
to
be
decades
off
and
is
not
fully
implemented
even
in
iceland
where
there
is

electricity


many
activists
feel
that

is
a
stall
a
way
to
avoid
forcing
the
shift

from
the

an
encyclopedia
or

is
a
collection
usually
a
book
of
information
about
things
humans
know


whether
it
is
published
on
paper
or
online
an
encyclopedia
is
a
collection
of
articles
each
on
a
different
subject


the
first
encyclopedias
may
have
begun
as
<collocation>lecture notes</collocation>
by
and
for
the
teachers
of
ancient
schools
such
as
aristotle
school


each
volume
in
the
encyclopedia
was
for
a
different
subject
or
course
of
study


the
word
encyclopedia
at
first
meant
the
teachings
of
the
school


the
name
encyclopedia
is
from
the
century


after
the
<collocation>printing press</collocation>
was
invented
dictionaries
with
long
definitions
began
to
be
called
encyclopedias


for
example
a
dictionary
of
science
if
it
included
essays
was
thought
of
as
an
encyclopedia
or
knowledgeable
book
on
the
subject
of
science


some
encyclopedias
then
put
essays
on
more
than
one
subject
in
<collocation>alphabetical order</collocation>
instead
of
grouping
them
together
by
subject


the
word
encyclopedia
was
put
in
the
title
of
some
encyclopedias


companies
were
started
for
the
purpose
of
publishing
encyclopedias
for
the
public
use
in
libraries
which
is
different
from
when
an
encyclopedia
was
the
curriculum
of
a
private
school


like
dictionaries
these
publishers
hired
hundreds
of
experts
to
write
articles
and
read
and
choose
articles


some
internet
encyclopedias
allowed
their
paying
customers
to
submit
articles


other
internet
encyclopedias
accepted
writing
from
users
of
the
encyclopedia


encyclopedias
are
a
great
source
of
knowledge


they
are
included
with
many
different
topics


types
of
encyclopedias
there
are
different
types
of
encyclopedias


some
are
general
and
have
pages
on
lots
of
topics


the
english
language
britannica
and
german
are
general
encyclopedias


some
are
about
specific
topics


for
example
there
are
encyclopedias
of
medicine
or
philosophy


there
are
also
some
encyclopedias
that
have
lots
of
topics
with
one
perspective
or
one
<collocation>cultural bias</collocation>


the
great
soviet
encyclopedia
is
one
of
these


many
dictionaries
have
different
sorts
of
information
to
encyclopedias


examples
are
the
dictionary
of
national
biography
the
dictionary
of
american
naval
<collocation>fighting ships</collocation>
and
black
law
dictionary


there
are
two
main
ways
of
organizing
encyclopedias
from
a
to
z
the
alphabetical
way
or
by
categories


most
encyclopedias
go
from
a
to
there
are
also
printed
encyclopedias
and
encyclopedias

the
computer
such
as

the
largest
online
encyclopedia
in

english
language

which
has

than

articles
now


the
second
largest
is
the
<collocation>encyclopaedia britannica</collocation>
which
is
the
largest
one
that
is
printed


a
writer
says
that
is
not
as
good
as
other
encyclopedias
because
anyone
can
change
it
so
some
people
may
write
things
that
are
wrong


also
the
way
that
works
means
that
there
is
likely
to
be
bias


on
the
other
hand
tyler
an
economist
says
that
other
writing
may
also
have
the
same
problems

eruption
is

earth
science
is
an
term
for
the
sciences
related
to
the
planet
earth


earth
science
may
also
be
called
geoscience


it
is
a
broader
term
than
geology
because
it
includes
aspects
of
planetary
science
which
is
part
of
astronomy


the
earth
sciences
include
the
study
of
the
atmosphere
oceans
and
biosphere
as
well
as
the
solid
earth


typically
earth
scientists
will
use
tools
from
physics
chemistry
biology
chronology
and
mathematics
to
understand
the
earth
and
how
it
evolved
to
its
current
state


if
there
is
one
fact
which
underlies
all
earth
science
it
is
this
the
earth
is
an
ancient
planet
which
has
been
changing
the
whole

since

the

the
earth
is
the
third
planet
from

and
it
is
the
only
planet
known
to
have
life
on
it


the
earth
formed
around
billion
<collocation>years ago</collocation>


it
is
one
of
four
rocky
planets
on
the
inside
of
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>


the
other
three
are
mercury
venus
and
mars


the
large
mass
of
the
sun
makes
the
earth
move
around
it
just
as
the
mass
of
the
earth
makes
the
moon
move
around
it


the
earth
also
turns
round
in
space
so
different
parts
face
the
sun
at
different
times


the
earth
goes
around
the
sun
once
one
year
for
every
times
it
turns
all
the
way
around
one
day


the
moon
goes
around
the
earth
about
every
days
and
reflects
light
from
the
sun


as
the
earth
goes
round
the
sun
at
the
same
time
the
changing
light
of
the
moon
takes
about
days
to
go
from
dark
to
bright
to
dark
again


that
is
where
the
idea
of
month
came
from


however
now
most
months
have
or
days
so
they
fit
into
one
year


the
earth
is
the
only
planet
in
our
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
that
has
a
large
amount
of
liquid
water


about
of
the
surface
of
the
earth
is
covered
by
oceans


because
of
this
it
is
sometimes
called
the
blue
planet


blue
planet
is
a
poetic
title
for
the
earth
used
in
movies
in
cheap
paper
books
in
poetry
and
in
government
reports
such
as
the
european
space
agency
exploring
the
water
cycle
of
the
blue
planet
because
of
its
water
the
earth
is
home
to
millions
of
species
of
plants
and
animals


the
things
that
live
on
earth
have
changed
its
surface
greatly


for
example
early
changed
the
air
and
gave
it
oxygen
