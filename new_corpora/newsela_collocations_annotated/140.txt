general
relativity
phenomena
a
black
hole
is
a
region
of
space
from
which
nothing
including
light
can
escape


according
to
the
general
theory
of
relativity
it
is
the
result
of
the
curving
of
spacetime
caused
by
a
very
dense
mass


around
a
black
hole
there
is
a
position
of
no
return
called
the
<collocation>event horizon</collocation>


it
is
called
black
because
it
absorbs
all
the
light
that
hits
it
reflecting
nothing
just
like
a
perfect
black
body
in
thermodynamics


under
the
theory
of
<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
black
holes
have
a
temperature
and
emit
hawking
radiation
through
slow
dissipation
by


a
black
hole
is
found
by
its
interaction
with
matter


a
black
hole
can
be
inferred
by
tracking
the
movement
of
a
group
of
stars
that
orbit
a
region
in
space


alternatively
when
gas
falls
into
a
black
hole
caused
by
a
companion
star
or
nebula
the
gas
spirals
inward
heating
to
very
high
temperatures
and
emitting
large
amounts
of
radiation


this
radiation
can
be
detected
from
earthbound
and
earth
orbiting
telescopes


astronomers
have
identified
<collocation>numerous stellar</collocation>
black
hole
candidates
and
have
also
found
evidence
of
black
holes
at
the
center
of

history
in
an
english
geologist
named
john
wrote
that
it
might
be
possible
for
something
to
be
so
big
and
heavy
that
the
escape
speed
from
its
gravity
is
equal
to
the
speed
of
light


gravity
gets
stronger
as
something
gets
bigger
or
more
massive


for
a
small
thing
like
a
rocket
to
escape
from
a
larger
thing
like
earth
it
has
to
escape
the
pull
of
our
gravity
or
it
will
fall
back


the
speed
that
it
must
travel
upward
to
get
away
from
earth
gravity
is
called
<collocation>escape velocity</collocation>


bigger
planets
like
jupiter
and
stars
have
more
mass
so
have
stronger
gravity
than
earth
so
the
<collocation>escape velocity</collocation>
is
much
faster


john
thought
it
was
possible
for
something
to
be
so
big
that
the
<collocation>escape velocity</collocation>
would
be
faster
than
the
speed
of
light
so
even
light
could
not
escape


in
promoted
the
same
idea
in
the
first
and
second
editions
of
his
book
exposition
du
<collocation>du monde</collocation>
it
was
removed
from
later
editions


some
scientists
thought
might
be
right
but
others
thought
that
light
had
no
mass
and
would
not
be
pulled
by
gravity


his
theory
was
forgotten


in
albert
einstein
wrote
an
explanation
of
gravity
called
general
relativity


it
is
a
very
complicated
theory
but
there
are
two
important
things
about
it
mass
causes
space
and
spacetime
to
bend
or
curve


moving
things
fall
along
or
follow
the
curves
in
space


this
is
what
we
call
gravity


light
always
travels
at
the
same
speed
and
is
affected
by
gravity


if
it
seems
to
change
speed
it
is
really
traveling
along
a
curve
in
spacetime


a
few
months
later
while
serving
in
the
war
the
german
physicist
used
einstein
equations
to
show
that
a
black
hole
could
exist


in
predicted
that
stars
heavier
than
the
sun
could
collapse
when
they
ran
out
of
hydrogen
or
other
nuclear
fuels
to
burn
and
died


in
robert
and
calculated
that
a
star
would
have
to
be
at
least
three
times
as
massive
as
the
sun
to
form
a
black
hole


in
john
wheeler
gave
black
holes
the
name
black
hole
for
the
first
time


before
that
they
were
called
dark
stars


in
stephen
hawking
and
roger
proved
that
black
holes
must
exist


although
the
black
holes
are
invisible
they
can
not
be
seen
some
of
the
matter
that
is
falling
into
them
is
very
bright


formation
of
black
holes
gravitational
collapse
the
gravitational
collapse
of
heavy
stars
is
assumed
to
be
responsible
for
the
formation
of
stellar
mass
black
holes


star
formation
in
the
early
universe
may
have
resulted
in
very
massive
stars
which
upon
their
collapse
would
have
produced
black
holes
of
up
to
solar
masses


these
black
holes
could
be
the
seeds
of
the
black
holes
found
in
the
centers
of
most
galaxies


while
most
of
the
energy
released
during
gravitational
collapse
is
emitted
very
quickly
an
outside
observer
does
not
actually
see
the
end
of
this
process


even
though
the
collapse
takes
a
finite
amount
of
time
from
the
reference
frame
of
matter
a
distant
observer
sees
the
material
slow
and
halt
just
above
the
<collocation>event horizon</collocation>
due
to
gravitational
time
dilation


light
from
the
collapsing
material
takes
longer
and
longer
to
reach
the
observer
with
the
light
emitted
just
before
the
<collocation>event horizon</collocation>
forms
is
delayed
an
infinite
amount
of
time


thus
the
external
observer
never
sees
the
formation
of
the
<collocation>event horizon</collocation>
instead
the
collapsing
material
seems
to
become
dimmer
and
increasingly
eventually
fading
away


explanation
most
black
holes
are
made
when
a
star
dies
and
leaves
behind
a
mass
that
is
at
least
one
solar
mass


stars
die
when
they
run
out
of
hydrogen
or
other
nuclear
fuel
to
burn
and
iron
is
produced


iron
does
not
give
off
energy
and
therefore
the
star
has
no
fuel
and
in
a
short
amount
of
time
the
star
collapses


a
star
death
is
called
a
supernova


stars
are
usually
in
equilibrium
which
means
they
are
making
enough
energy
to
push
their
mass
outward
against
the
force
of
gravity


when
the
star
runs
out
of
fuel
to
make
energy
gravity
takes
over


<collocation>gravity pulls</collocation>
the
center
of
the
star
inward
very
quickly
so
quickly
that
it
would
have
to
be
repeated
several
thousand
times
before
it
took
up
a
single
second
and
it
collapses
into
a
little
ball


this
results
in
the
restart
of
thermonuclear
reactions


the
star
starts
expanding
again
but
again
the
nuclear
fuel
goes
out


this
continues
until
the
star
can
not
make
any
more
energy
and
then
comes
the
final
collapse


the
collapse
is
so
fast
and
violent
that
it
makes
a
shock
wave
and
that
causes
the
rest
of
the
star
to
explode
outward


as
the
gravity
pushes
the
star
inward
the
pressure
in
the
center
of
star
reaches
to
such
an
extreme
level
that
it
enables
heavier
molecules
like
iron
and
carbon
to
interact
to
release
nuclear
energy


the
release
of
the
energy
from
the
star
during
a
very
short
period
of
time
about
one
hour
is
with
such
a
high
rate
that
it
outshines
an
entire
galaxy


the
ball
in
the
center
is
so
dense
a
lot
of
mass
in
a
small
space
or
volume
that
if
you
could
somehow
scoop
only
one
teaspoon
of
material
and
bring
it
to
earth
it
would
sink
to
the
core
of
the
planet


if
the
remaining
mass
is
of
below
one
solar
mass
it
forms
a
white
dwarf


if
it
is
from
solar
mass
it
forms
a
neutron
star
and
if
it
is
above
solar
mass
it
forms
a
black
hole


even
without
a
supernova
a
black
hole
will
form
any
time
there
is
a
lot
of
matter
in
a
small
space
without
enough
energy
to
act
against
gravity
and
stop
it
from
collapsing


if
supernovas
are
so
bright
why
do
we
not
see
them
often


actually
there
are
usually
hundreds
of
years
between
super
nova
sightings


it
is
because
the
period
of
being
a
super
nova
in
a
star
life
cycle
is
only
a
few
hours
out
of
the
billions
of
years
in
a
star
life
span


the
probability
chance
of
looking
at
a
star
in
sky
and
that
being
in
super
nova
state
is
equal
to
the
ratio
of
an
hour
over
several
billion
years


it
is
worth
mentioning
that
all
of
the
heavier
materials
like
carbon
oxygen
all
the
metals
that
make
the
life
on
the
earth
possible
and
are
ingredients
of
all
living
creatures
can
only
form
in
the
extreme
pressure
at
the
center
of
a
super
nova


so
we
are
all
a
remnant
ash
from
one
exploding
star
several
billion
<collocation>years ago</collocation>


supernovas
replenish
the
<collocation>interstellar medium</collocation>
for
the
next
generation
of
stars
also


black
holes
main
black
hole
black
holes
have
also
been
found
in
the
middle
of
almost
every
galaxy
in
the
universe


these
are
called
black
holes
and
are
the
biggest
black
holes
of
all


they
formed
when
the
universe
was
very
young
and
also
helped
to
form
all
the
galaxies


quasars
are
believed
to
be
powered
by
gravity
collecting
material
into
in
the
centres
of
<collocation>distant galaxies</collocation>


since
light
can
not
escape
the
are
at
the
center
of
quasars
the
escaping
energy
is
generated
outside
the
<collocation>event horizon</collocation>
by
gravitational
stresses
and
immense
friction
on
the
<collocation>incoming material</collocation>


huge
central
masses
to
solar
masses
have
been
measured
in
quasars


<collocation>several dozen</collocation>
nearby
large
galaxies
with
no
sign
of
a
<collocation>quasar nucleus</collocation>
contain
a
similar
central
black
hole
in
their
nuclei


therefore
it
is
thought
that
all
large
galaxies
have
one
but
only
a
small
fraction
are
active
with
enough
to
power
radiation
and
so
are
seen
as
quasars

a

by
an

is
making
a

einstein
cross
four
images
from
one
quasar
at
the
middle
of
a
black
hole
there
is
a
gravitational
center
called
a
singularity


it
is
impossible
to
see
it
because
the
gravity
prevents
any
light
escaping


around
the
tiny
singularity
there
is
a
large
area
where
light
which
would
normally
pass
by
gets
sucked
in
as
well


the
edge
of
this
area
is
called
the
<collocation>event horizon</collocation>


the
gravity
of
the
black
hole
gets
weaker
at
a
distance


the
<collocation>event horizon</collocation>
is
the
place
farthest
away
from
the
middle
where
the
gravity
is
still
strong
enough
to
trap
light


outside
the
<collocation>event horizon</collocation>
light
and
matter
will
still
be
pulled
toward
the
black
hole


if
a
black
hole
is
surrounded
by
matter
the
matter
will
form
an
disk
means
gathering
around
the
black
hole


an
disk
looks
something
like
the
rings
of
saturn


as
it
gets
sucked
in
the
matter
gets
very
hot
and
shoots
radiation
into
space


think
of
this
as
the
water
spinning
around
the
hole
before
it
falls
in


most
black
holes
are
too
far
away
for
us
to
see
the
disk
and
jet


the
only
way
to
know
a
black
hole
is
there
is
by
seeing
how
stars
gas
and
light
behave
around
it


with
a
black
hole
nearby
even
objects
as
big
as
a
star
move
in
a
different
way
usually
faster
than
they
would
if
the
black
hole
was
not
there


since
we
can
not
see
black
holes
they
must
be
detected
by
other
means


when
a
black
hole
passes
between
us
and
a
source
of
light
the
light
bends
around
the
black
hole
creating
a
mirror
image


that
effect
is
called
gravitational


hawking
radiation
hawking
radiation
is
black
body
radiation
which
is
emitted
by
black
holes
due
to
quantum
effects
near
the
<collocation>event horizon</collocation>


it
is
named
after
the
physicist
stephen
hawking
who
provided
a
theoretical
argument
for
its
existence
in


hawking
radiation
reduces
the
mass
and
the
energy
of
the
black
hole
and
is
therefore
also
known
as
black
hole
evaporation


because
of
this
black
holes
that
lose
more
mass
than
they
gain
through
other
means
are
expected
to
shrink
and
ultimately
vanish


micro
black
holes
are
predicted
to
be
larger
net
emitters
of
radiation
than
larger
black
holes
and
should
shrink
and
dissipate
faster

there
are
two
ways
to

many
countries

in
other
countries
there
are
laws
that
some
people
have
to
be

the
military
even
if
they

not
want

also
trained
to
fight
on
land
when

beaches


they
work
closely
with

army
which
are
often
no
better
than
common
gangsters
or
criminals

new
people
in
the
military
are
often
called
recruits


they
have
training
at
a
special
camp
sometimes
called
boot
camp


during
this
training
the
recruits
usually
have
very
little
free
time


they
learn
to
understand
the
orders
or
commands
that
are
given
by
the
officers
to
the
troops


the
troops
are
the
military
people
in
a
group

learn
the
right
ways
to
obey
the
orders


they
do
a
lot
of
exercise
to
improve
their
fitness
and
strength


they
learn
about
weapons
first
aid
and
their
uniforms
and
kit


their
kit
is
their
equipment


recruits
also
learn
how
to
march


this
is
the
way
to
walk
together
keeping
in
step


learning
to
march
is
sometimes
called
drill


by
the
time
soldiers
finish
boot
camp
they
should
know
enough
to
be
a
helpful
person
in
their
group


the
camp
usually
finishes
with
a
parade
in
which
the
newly
trained
recruits
show
off
their
marching
and
other
skills
they
have
learned
in
front
of
important
visitors


once
the
recruits
are
fully
trained
they
are
ready
to
defend
protect
their
country
from
attack
or
to
go
to
war
if
necessary
