individual
or
they
might
vote
for
a

systems


countries
that

transportation

by
governments
and
paid
for
by
taxes
from
the
citizens
of
a
country

infrastructure
such
as
roads
and

is
designed
by

engineers
and
<collocation>urban planners</collocation>


vehicles

travel
on
the
infrastructure


vehicles
include
cars
trucks
trains
and
airplanes


vehicles
are
usually
designed
by
<collocation>mechanical engineers</collocation>


vessels
include
boats
ferries
and
barges
which
travel
on
canals
and
use
docks
and
seaports


in
the
same
way
that

can
be

also
needs

an

energy
and
the

transport
uses
a

of
energy


most
transport
uses

and
gas


this
can
create
pollution


<collocation>environmental regulations</collocation>
laws
and
fuels
for

<collocation>liquified natural</collocation>
gas
can
reduce
pollution


but
as
more
vehicles
are
used
more
pollution
is
created


ethanol
and
pollute
less
than
petroleum


kinds
of
transportation
there
are
three
main
kinds
of
transportation


they
are
land
transportation
using
