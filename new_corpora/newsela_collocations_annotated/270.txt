heat
is
not
the
same
as
temperature


the
temperature
of
an
object
is
a
measure
of
the
average
speed
of
the
moving
particles
it
is
made
from
and
the
energy
of
the
particles
is
called
the
internal
energy


when
an
object
is
heated
its
internal
energy
can
increase
to
make
the
object
hotter


the
first
law
of
thermodynamics
says
that
the
increase
in
internal
energy
is
equal
to
the
heat
added
minus
the
work
done
on
the
surroundings


thermal
energy
is
the
type
of
energy
that
a
thing
has
because
of
its
temperature


in
thermodynamics
thermal
energy
is
the
internal
energy
present
in
a
system
in
a
state
of

because
of
its

that

heat
is
defined
as
a

energy
in
transit
from
one
object
to
another
caused
by
a
difference
in

between
two
objects

properties
of
heat
heat
is
a
form
of
energy
and
not
a
physical
substance


heat
has
no
mass


heat
can
move
from
one
place
to
another
in
different
ways
conduction
convection
radiation
the
measure
of
how
much
heat
is
needed
to
cause
some
change
in
temperature
for
a
material
is
the
specific
heat
capacity
of
the
material


if
the
particles
in
the
material
are
hard
to
move
then
more
energy
is
needed
to
make
them
move
quickly
so
a
lot
of
heat
will
cause
a
small
change
in
temperature


a
different
particle
that
is
easier
to
move
will
need
less
heat
for
the
same
change
in
temperature


specific
<collocation>heat capacities</collocation>
can
be
looked
up
in
a
table
like
this
one


unless
some
work
is
done
heat
moves
only
from
hot
things
to
cold
things


measuring
heat
heat
can
be
measured


that
is
the
amount
of
heat
given
out
or
taken
in
can
be
given
a
value


one
of
the
units
of
measurement
for
heat
is
the
joule


heat
is
usually
measured
with
a
calorimeter
where
the
energy
in
a
material
is
allowed
to
flow
into
nearby
water
which
has
a
known
specific
heat
capacity


the
temperature
of
the
water
is
then
measured
before
and
after
and
heat
can
be
found
using
a
formula

broadly
speaking
they

two
kinds

the
first
is
structural
they

is

<collocation>electrical engineering</collocation>


cryptography
is
used
in
atm
bank
cards
computer
passwords
and
shopping
on
the
internet


when
a
message
is
sent
using
cryptography
it
is
changed
or
encrypted
before
it
is
sent


the
method
of
changing
text
is
called
a
code
or
more
precisely
a
cipher


the
changed
text
is
called
ciphertext


the
change
makes
the
message
hard
to
read


someone
who
wants
to
read
it
must
change
it
back
or
decrypt
it


how
to
change
it
back
is
a
secret


both
the
person
that
sends
the
message
and
the
one
that
gets
it
should
know
the
secret
way
to
change
it
but
other
people
should
not
be
able
to


studying
the
to
discover
the
secret
is
called
cryptanalysis
or
cracking
or
sometimes
code
breaking


different
types
of
cryptography
can
be
easier
or
harder
to
use
and
can
hide
the
secret
message
better
or
worse


ciphers
use
a
key
which
is
a
secret
that
hides
the
secret
messages


the
method
need
be
secret


various
people
can
use
the
same
method
but
different
keys
so
they
can
not
read
each
others
messages


since
the
<collocation>caesar cipher</collocation>
has
only
as
many
keys
as
the
number
of
letters
in
the
alphabet
it
is
easily
cracked
by
trying
all
the
keys


ciphers
that
allow
billions
of
keys
are
cracked
by
more
complex
methods

nobody
else
needs
to
know
the
secret
key


the
details
of
asymmetric
cryptography
make
it
less
useful
than
symmetric
cryptography
for
actually
sending
messages


instead
it
is
often
used
for
computer
signatures
when
a
computer
must
know
that
a
file
was
sent
from
a
certain
sender


for
example
computer
software
companies
that
release
updates
for
their
software
can
sign
those
updates
to
prove
that
the
update
was
made
by
them
so
that
hackers
can
not
make
their
own
updates
that
would
cause
harm


computers
can
also
use
asymmetric
ciphers
to
give
each
other
the
keys
for
symmetric
ciphers


computers
computers
can
do
hard
math
very
fast
and
because
of
this
they
can
do
very
strong
encryption


examples
are
computer
algorithms
like
blowfish
and
many
others


using
good
algorithms
like
these
can
make
it
very
hard
to
read
the
information
that
is
sent


people
people
are
better
at
patterns
changing
order
of
words
or
letters
and
using
words
with
different
meanings


because
people
are
slower
than
computers
any
cryptography
they
use
can
probably
be
broken
if
enough
of
the
secret
way
to
change
it
is
known


simple
forms
of
cryptography
that
people
can
do
without
machines
are
caesar
ciphers
and
transposition
ciphers
but
there
are
lots
more


they
are
especially
useful
in
espionage
because
a
spy
wo
be
caught
carrying
a
code
machine
