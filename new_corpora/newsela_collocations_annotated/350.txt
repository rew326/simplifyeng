one
may
say
that
homosexuality
is
the
term
used
for
people
that
feel
romantically
or
sexually
attracted
to
their
own
sex
but
other
definitions
also
exist


when
one
views
homosexuality
as
the
term
for
people
that
feel
romantically
or
sexually
attracted
to
their
own
sex
more
people
are
gay
than
when
one
might
view
homosexuality
as
only
a
term
for
people
who
do
have
sexual
relationships
with
their
own
sex


usually
the
term
is
used
to
view
all
the
people
who
are
romantically
or
sexually
attracted
to
their
own
sex
as
well
as
those
with
such
attractions
who
have
not
had
a
sexual
relationship
with
their
own
sex
yet


nonetheless
the
most
visible
form
of
homosexuality
is
the
actual
relationship


most
evidence
of
homosexuality
in
ancient
cultures
comes
from
drawings
of
the
men
in
an
intimate
relationship
or
sex
because
it
the
most
obvious


the
word
homosexual
comes
from
the
ancient
greek
word
homo
meaning
same
and
the
latin
word
for
gender


people
in
the
community
usually
say
gay
instead
of
homosexual


some
people
also
use
the
term
from
greek
lang
el
homos
meaning
the
same
and
lang
el
meaning
to
love


this
term
emphasizes
romantic
interest
in
the
same
sex
rather
than
sexual
attraction


other
names
there
are
many
different
words
to
describe
homosexual
people


some
of
these
are
used
to
<collocation>insult homosexual</collocation>
people


however
the
community
sometimes
uses
these
words
to
describe
themselves
because
the
word
homosexual
can
sound
too
clinical


this
is
done
to
make
the
words
<collocation>less hurtful</collocation>


some
words
to
describe
homosexual
men
are
gay
and
queer


words
to
describe
homosexual
women
are
lesbian
and
dyke


lesbian
is
used
most
often


dyke
is
used
less
often
and
is
sometimes
used
to
describe
lesbians
who
are
more
masculine
act
or
dress
more
like
men


however
queer
and
dyke
are
sometimes
used
against
gay
people
as
insults
so
they
can
sometimes
be
offensive

out
or
out
of
the
closet
is
a
slang
term
that
means
a
homosexual
person
is
open
about
his
or
her
<collocation>sexual orientation</collocation>


this
means
he
or
she
does
not
hide
the
fact
that
he
or
she
is
homosexual


some
gay
and
lesbian
people
stay
in

closet
because
of
fear
of
what
would
happen
or
because
they
live
in
a
place
that
is
not

for

sometimes
people
who

out
also
say
they
are

out
means
they
are
not

their
<collocation>sexual orientation</collocation>


proud
means
that
they
are
pleased
about
it


proud
or
pride
has
a
special
meaning
in
the
community


it
means
they
are
celebrating
and
being
happy
that
they
are
homosexual


it
is
not
pride
meaning
that
they
have
done
something
to
be
proud
of
but
pride
meaning
the
opposite
of
shame


many
cities
have
pride
parades


these
used
to
be
<collocation>protest marches</collocation>


today
they
are
usually
celebrations
of
the
community


they
usually
occur
in
june
in
memory
of
the
<collocation>stonewall riots</collocation>
that
happened
in
<collocation>new york</collocation>
city
in


these

happened
because
police
harassed
and
arrested
people
for
being

stonewall
or
the
<collocation>stonewall riots</collocation>
are
sometimes
called
the
start
of
the
rights
movement


causes
the
causes
of
homosexuality
and
bisexuality
are
controversial
people
do
not
agree
on
them


some
people
see
homosexuality
and
bisexuality
as
a
choice
that
a
person
makes


however
many
modern
scientists
have
theorized
that
homosexuality
is
not
a
choice


the
causes
of
homosexuality
are
not
all
understood
but
genetics
and
the
effects
of
prenatal
hormones
when
a
baby
is
growing
in
its
mother
and
environment
are
sometimes
thought
to
be
causes


scientists
also
show
that
homosexuality
happens
not
only
in
humans


some
animals
like
penguins
chimpanzees
and
dolphins
often
show
homosexuality
some
even
for
periods
as
is
the
case
with
humans


many
scientists
and
doctors
also
agree
that
no
one
can
change
their
<collocation>sexual orientation</collocation>


doctors
used
to
treat
gay
people
as
if
they
had
<collocation>mental illnesses</collocation>


however
homosexuality
is
no
longer
called
a
disease
by
doctors
in
many
countries


there
are
some
religious
groups
who
still
try
to
cure
homosexuality


this
is
called
reparative
therapy


in
therapies
like
this
one
homosexual
individuals
have
tried
to
change
themselves
to
heterosexual
and
have
even
claimed
they
were
changed
but
most
people
do
not
believe
it
is
possible


reparative
therapy
is
condemned
by
many
medical
and
psychiatry
groups
like
the
american
<collocation>psychological association</collocation>
american
<collocation>psychiatric association</collocation>
royal
college
of
psychiatrists
national
association
of
social
workers
royal
college
of
nursing
and
the
american
academy
of
pediatrics


these
scientific
and
educated
groups
agree
that
<collocation>sexual orientation</collocation>
can
not
change


they
also
agree
that
gay
people
can
be
badly
hurt
by
reparative
therapy


many
people
believe
that
it
is
unfortunate
to
discuss
causes
of
homosexuality
and
bisexuality
without
discussing
causes
of
heterosexuality
too


although
it
is
easy
to
understand
why
heterosexuality
exists
heterosexual
sex
produces
babies
that
does
not
explain
how
the
brain
develops
to
produce
heterosexual
people


heterosexuality
homosexuality
and
bisexuality
all
have
causes
and
some
people
believe
that
to
discuss
only
the
causes
of
homosexuality
and
bisexuality
suggests
that
there
is
something
wrong
with
people
who
have
those
orientations


relationships
further
couple
marriage
gay
people
can
fall
in
love
and
have
relationships


in
most
countries
they
can
not
legally
marry
their
partners


however
they
still
have
relationships
in
the
same
way
as
heterosexual
people


they
often
call
each
other
partners
or
instead
of
spouse
husband
or
wife


instead
of
having
a
marriage
ceremony
they
may
have
a
<collocation>commitment ceremony</collocation>


a
gay
wedding
ceremony


some
homosexual
people
have
<collocation>wedding ceremonies</collocation>
even
though
governments
do
not
recognize
or
accept
them


they
may
call
their
partner
a
spouse
wife
or
husband
despite
the
law


but
to
them
the
important
part
about
marriage
is
not
just
the
name


married
people
get
many
benefits
from
being
married


depending
on
the
country
these
benefits
can
include
paying
less
taxes
getting
their
spouse
insurance
inheriting
property
social
security
benefits
having
or
adopting
children
together
emigrating
to
a
spouse
country
being
able
to
make
choices
for
a
sick
spouse
or
even
being
allowed
to
visit
a
sick
spouse
who
is
in
a
hospital

there
are

countries
that
allow
homosexual
people
to
marry

instead
of
marriage
some
countries
or
states
offer
homosexuals
civil
unions
or
domestic
partnerships


this
gives
them
some
of
the
protections
and
benefits
of
marriage
but
not
all


civil
unions
and
domestic
partnerships
are
sometimes
seen
by
the
community
as
being
second
class
not
as
good
as
first
class


they
do
offer
some
benefits
for
gay
and
lesbian
couples
but
they
also
suggest
that
these
couples
are
not
as
important
or
valid
as
heterosexual
couples


some
people
even
say
this
is
like
the
separate
but
equal
rules
that
were
used
to
segregate
people
by
race
in
the
united
states


they
believe
that
separate
is
never
equal
and
homosexuals
should
not
accept
being
second
class
citizens


religion
main
religion
and
homosexuality
many
religions
teach
that
homosexual
sex
is
a
sin


such
religions
traditionally
include
islam
christianity
and
judaism


usually
it
is
only
the
act
of
<collocation>sexual intercourse</collocation>
that
is
considered
sinful
and
not
natural


not
all
believe
the
attraction
is
sinful
just
the
actions
in
response
to
the
desire


however
some
denominations
different
parts
of
these
religions
and
some
eastern
religions
now
accept
homosexuality


there
are
several
other
religions
that
are
accepting
of
homosexuality
particularly
new
religions


there
are
also
some
religions
which
are
indifferent
to
homosexuality
such
as
zoroastrianism
and


<collocation>problems homosexuals</collocation>
face
further
homophobia
in
modern
times
homosexuality
is
more
accepted
in
western
countries


most
western
countries
have
laws
that
protect
homosexuals
from
violence
and
discrimination


fact
date
july
in
many
other
countries
however
homosexuals
are
not
safe
from
discrimination


a
homosexual
person
can
be
fired
from
a
job
because
he
is
gay
even
if
he
is
a
good
worker


fact
date
july
homosexuals
can
be
denied
renting
a
home
or
being
able
to
eat
in
a
restaurant
because
of
their
<collocation>sexual orientation</collocation>


fact
date
july
in
these
countries
homosexuals
can
experience
discrimination
and
violence


fact
date
july
for
example
islamic
law
is
used
in
some
places
to
kill
homosexuals
or
place
them
in
jail


in
iran
since
some
groups
believe
over
homosexuals
have
been
killed
because
of
their
<collocation>sexual orientation</collocation>


in
after
fourteen
months
of
prison
and
torture
two
<collocation>teenage boys</collocation>
were
hung
in
iran


in
the
<collocation>united kingdom</collocation>
homosexuality
used
to
be
a
crime


oscar
the
famous
irish
writer
was
imprisoned
for
it
and
as
a
result
it
destroyed
his
reputation
and
career
as
a
wit
and
playwright


alan
the
man
who
helped
the
allies
in
<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii
by
breaking
the
enigma
code
used
by
the
germans
was
convicted
of
this
crime
and
ultimately
killed
himself
over
the
effects
of
the
attempt
to
cure
his
homosexuality


today
in
the
<collocation>united kingdom</collocation>
homosexuals
are
safer


homosexual
sex
between
adults
is
not
a
crime


gay
and
lesbian
couples
can
marry
in
england
and
wales


in
scotland
and
northern
ireland
they
can
not
marry
but
they
can
have
civil
partnerships
that
have
some
of
the
rights
and
benefits
of
marriage


gay
people
can
be
in
the
military


so
although
the
<collocation>united kingdom</collocation>
has
changed
many
things
homosexuals
still
do
not
have
full
<collocation>equal rights</collocation>
there


in
most
of
the
world
homosexuals
still
do
not
have
the
same
rights
and
freedoms
that
heterosexuals
have


<collocation>homosexual behavior</collocation>
in
animals
two
male
penguins
in
the
<collocation>new york</collocation>
central
park
zoo
similar
to

became
known
internationally
because
they
live
as
a

later
they
were
given
an
egg
that
needed
hatching
and
care


they
successfully
cared
for
and
hatched
the
egg


<collocation>homosexual behavior</collocation>
has
also
been
seen
in
animals


homosexual
transgender
and
bisexual
behavior
includes
sex
courtship
affection
<collocation>pair bonding</collocation>
and
parenting


<collocation>homosexual behavior</collocation>
is
widespread
among
animals


bruce
did
research
in


it
shows
that
<collocation>homosexual behavior</collocation>
has
been
observed
in
close
to
species
from
primates
to
gut
worms
and
is
well
documented
for
of
them


the
sexual
behavior
of
animals
takes
many
different
forms
even
within
the
same
species


the
motivations
for
these
behaviors
are
only
partly
known
mainly
because
the
species
has
not
been
fully
studied
yet


according
to
the

kingdom
does
it

sexual
diversity
including

his
way
up
the
ranks
to
become
a
general


he
became
the
supreme
<collocation>allied commander</collocation>
who
led
operation
overlord
an
allied
attack
on
germany
which
was
one
of
the
most
important
battles
of
the
war


after
<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii
ended
he
was
considered
a
war
hero


in
the
<collocation>presidential election</collocation>
the
american
public
begged
eisenhower
to
run
for
president


eisenhower
whose
political
views
were
unknown
at
the
time
joined
the
republican
party


he
chose
richard
nixon
as
his
candidate
and
won
the
election
by
beating


presidency
he
served
two
terms
from


eisenhower
was
the
first
president
of
the
united
states
to
be
president
of
all
states


during
the
beginning
of
his
first
term
he
oversaw
a
ceasefire
which
stopped
the
fighting
during
the
korean
war


he
created
nasa
the
united
states
space
program
which
began
a
space
race
against
the
soviet
union


eisenhower
believed
that
the
united
states
should
not
try
to
fight
wars
overseas
but
instead
that
united
states
amount
of
nuclear
weapons
should
be
increased
by
a
lot
so
it
could
have
an
advantage
in
the
cold
war


the
united
states
was
able
to
keep
the
soviet
union
in
check
without
spending
a
lot
of
money


for
this
reason
the
government
had
balanced
budgets
during
his
presidency
and
did
not
have
to
borrow
money


he
intimidated
the
soviet
union
by
making
them
believe
that
the
united
states
would
respond
to
any
act
of
aggression
with
the
use
of
nuclear
weapons


that
policy
is
called
new
look
and
massive
retaliation


he
also
authorized
planes
to
spy
on
the
soviet
union
but
when
a
spy
plane
accidentally
crashed
into
the
soviet
union
near
the
end
of
eisenhower
term
it
hurt
relations
between
the
united
states
and
the
soviet
union


mccarthyism
when
senator
joseph
was
accusing
hundreds
of
people
of
being
<collocation>communist spies</collocation>
without
evidence
was
also
an
issue
during
his
presidency


eisenhower
disliked
joseph
and
tried
to
bring
him
down
behind
the
scenes
but
eisenhower
did
not
like
to
make
enemies
so
he
did
not
talk
about
much


domestically
in
the
country
the
economy
was
doing
very
well
and
the
nation
was
prosperous


eisenhower
supervised
the
creation
of
the
interstate
highway
system
and
created
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare


eisenhower
was
a
<collocation>moderate conservative</collocation>
near
the
center
of
the
political
spectrum


he
wanted
to
continue
some
new
deal
programs
such
as
social
security
but
at
the
same
time
he
wanted
the
government
to
be
limited


at
first
many
criticized
him
for
not
doing
enough
to
give
civil
rights
to
african
americans
but
later
during
his
presidency
he
signed
two
civil
rights
acts
and
sent
federal
troops
to
topeka
kansas
to
make
sure
schools
were
desegregated


when
eisenhower
presidency
ended
he
was
not
very
popular
with
scholars


over
time
his
reputation
slowly
improved
and
historians
now
generally
consider
him
to
be
a
good
president
