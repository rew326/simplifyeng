it
can
take
the
form
of
posters
tv
advertisements
and
radio
announcements


sometimes
it
keeps
the
people
of
a
country
happy
telling
them
that
their
country
is
fighting
well
and
telling
them
how
important
it
is
that
the
enemy
is
defeated


sometimes
it
tries
to
make
people
hate
the
enemy


the
information
could
tell
people
that
the
enemy
is
evil
or
make
them
seem
not
human


sometimes
a
government
gives
propaganda
to
the
enemy
telling
them
that
the
war
is
going
badly
for
them
and
that
they
should
stop
fighting


when
a
country
is
not
at
war
propaganda
can
still
be
used


the
government
may
use
propaganda
to
change
what
people
think
about
a
political
situation


a
group
may
try
to
change
the
way
people
act
towards
an
issue


propaganda
under
some
countries
like
dictatorships
is
used
along
with
censorship


while
propaganda
tries
to
give
people
false
ideas
censorship
forces
the
ones
who
disagree
with
propaganda
to
keep
quiet


then
the
propaganda
can
say
everything
because
nobody
can
question
it
in
public


propaganda
is
also
used
to
win
people
by
tricking
them


some
people
say
that
cults
use
propaganda
to
get
people
to
join
them


examples
for
propaganda

propaganda

propaganda

propaganda

was
used
by
the
soviet
union
from
beginning
to
end


some
great
artists
like
and
el
helped
them
do
it


many
others
such
as
did
not


history
propaganda
has
been
used
in
every
known
civilisation


it
was
used
by
ii
on
his
monuments
in
ancient
egypt
it
was
used
by
ancient
greek
orators
it
was
used
by
<collocation>julius caesar</collocation>
and
all
roman
emperors


the
word
itself
is
formed
from
propagate
meaning
to
multiply


propaganda
was
carried
much
further
by
the
de
propaganda
fide
of
the
catholic
church


this
committee
founded
in
by
pope
gregory
had
action
branches
in
most
european
countries


these
were
the
local
branches
of
the
inquisition
which
sought
out
heretics


with
torture
and
the
threat
of
death
by
burning
at
the
stake
they
forced
heretics
to
recant
to
publicly
withdraw
their
previous
beliefs


the
objective
was
to
remove
all
challenges
to
the
supremacy
of
the
church
in
matters
of
belief


the
handbook
for
noted
punishment
does
not
take
place
primarily
and
for
the
correction
and
good
of
the
person
punished
but

the
public
good

that
others
may
become

commit


is
the
study
of
how
spaces
are
organized
how
the
objects
are
structured
in
terms
of
position


it
also
studies
how
spaces
are
connected


it
is
divided
into
algebraic
differential
and
geometric


a
strip
a
surface
with
only
one
side
and
one
edge
such
shapes
are
an
object
of
study
in


has
sometimes
been
called
geometry
because
in
of
dimensions
there
is
no
difference
between
a
circle
and
a
square
a
circle
made
out
of
a
rubber
band
can
be
stretched
into
a
square
but
there
is
a
difference
between
a
circle
and
a
figure
eight
you
can
not
stretch
a
figure
eight
into
a
circle
without
tearing


the
spaces
studied
in
are
called
spaces


they
vary
from
familiar
manifolds
to
some
very
exotic
constructions


natural
origin
in
many
problems
we
often
divide
a
large
space
into
smaller
areas
for
instance
a
house
is
divided
into
rooms
a
nation
into
states
a
type
of
quantity
into
numbers


each
of
these
smaller
areas
house
state
number
is
next
to
other
small
areas
other
and
the
places
where
the
areas
meet
are
connections


if
we
write
down
on
paper
a
list
of
spaces
and
the
connections
between
them
we
have
written
down
a
description
of
a
space
a
space


all
spaces
have
the
same
properties
connections
and
are
made
of
the
same
structure
a
list
of
smaller
areas


this
makes
it
easier
to
study
how
spaces
behave
in
general
and
to
use
general
algorithms


for
instance
to
program
a
robot
to
navigate
a
house
we
simply
give
it
a
list
of
rooms
the
connections
between
each
room
doors
and
an
algorithm
that
can
determine
the
sequence
of
rooms
to
travel
through
to
reach
any
other
desired
room


we
can
go
further
by
creating
subdivisions
of
subdivisions
of
space


for
instance
a
nation
divided
into
states
divided
into
counties
divided
into
city
boundaries

the
night
sky
without
a
telescope
some
stars
appear
brighter
than
other
stars


this
difference
is
measured
in
terms
of
apparent
magnitude


there
are
two
reasons
for
stars
to
differ
in
apparent
magnitude


if
one
star
is
much
closer
than
another
otherwise
similar
star
it
will
appear
much
brighter
in
just
the
same
way
that
a
candle
that
is
near
looks
brighter
than
a
big
fire
that
is
far
away


if
one
star
is
much
larger
or
much
hotter
than
another
star
at
about
the
same
distance
it
will
appear
much
brighter
in
just
the
same
way
that
if
two
fires
are
the
same
distance
away
the
bigger
or
hotter
one
will
look
brighter


a
star
true
luminosity
is
its
absolute
magnitude


beside
light
stars
also
give
off
a
solar
wind
and
neutrinos


these
are
very
small
particles


stars
are
a
source
of
a
gravity
field


this
is
what
keeps
planets
close
to
them


it
is
also
not
unusual
for
two
stars
to
orbit
each
other


this
happens
when
they
are
close
together


this
is
also
because
of
gravity
in
the
same
way
as
the
earth
orbits
the
sun


these
binary
stars
binary
meaning
two
are
thought
to
be
very
common


there
are
even
groups
of
three
or
more
stars
orbiting
each
other


proxima
centauri
is
the
smallest
star
in
a
group
of
three


stars
are
not
spread
evenly
across
all
of
space


they
are
grouped
into
galaxies


a
typical
galaxy
contains
hundreds
of
billions
of
stars


history
of
seeing
stars
people
have
seen
patterns
in
the
stars
from
<collocation>long ago</collocation>


this
from
is
the
constellation
of
leo
the
lion
as
imagined
by
johannes


stars
have
been
important
to
people
all
over
the
world
for
all
of
history


stars
have
been
part
of
religious
practices


<collocation>long ago</collocation>
people
believed
that
stars
could
never
die


astronomers
organized
stars
into
groups
called
constellations


they
used
the
constellations
to
help
them
see
the
motion
of
the
planets
and
to
guess
the
position
of
the
sun


the
motion
of
the
sun
and
the
stars
was
used
to
make
calendars


the
calendars
were
used
by
farmers
to
decide
when
to
plant
crops
and
when
to
harvest
them


the
life
of
stars
main
<collocation>stellar evolution</collocation>
stars
are
made
in


these
are
big
areas
that
has
more
gas
than
normal
space
has


the
gas
in
a
nebula
is
attracted
to
all
the
other
gas
by
gravity


this
makes
the
gas
in
the
nebula
very
thick


stars
form
in
these
thick
areas


the
orion
nebula
is
an
example
of
a
place
where
gas
is
coming
together
to
form
stars
