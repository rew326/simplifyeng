telescope
a
telescope
is
an
important
tool
for
astronomy
that
gathers
light
and
directs
it
to
a
single
point


some
do
this
with
curved
mirrors
some
with
curved
lenses
and
some
with
both


telescopes
make
things
look
bigger
brighter
and
closer


galileo
was
the
first
person
to
use
a
telescope
for
astronomy
but
he
did
not
invent
them


the
first
telescope
was
invented
in
the
netherlands
in


some
telescopes
not
mainly
used
for
astronomy
are
binoculars
camera
lenses
or
spyglasses

telescope

light
your

there
are
telescopes
for
invisible
light


<collocation>infrared telescopes</collocation>
look
like
normal
telescopes
but
have
to
be
kept
cold
since
all
warm
things
give
off
infrared
light


radio
telescopes
are
like
radio
antennas
usually
shaped
like
large
dishes


and
<collocation>gamma ray</collocation>
telescopes
have
a
problem
because
the
rays
go
through
most
metals
and
glasses


to
solve
this
problem
the
mirrors
are
shaped
like
a
bunch
of
rings
inside
each
other
so
the
rays
strike
them
at
a
shallow
angle
and
are
reflected


these
telescopes
have
to
be
placed
in
satellites
because
not
enough
of
this
radiation
reaches
the
earth


other
telescopes
are
also
put
in
orbit
so
the
earth
atmosphere
does
interfere
