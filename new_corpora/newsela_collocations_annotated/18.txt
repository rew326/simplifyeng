christians
consider
the
holy
bible
to
be
a
sacred
book
inspired
by
god


the
holy
bible
is
a
combination
of
the
hebrew
bible
or
torah
and
a
collection
of
writings
called
the
new
testament


views
on
the
importance
of
these
writings
vary


some
christian
groups
prefer
to
favor
the
new
testament
while
others
believe
the
entire
bible
is
equally
important


also
while
many
christians
prefer
to
consider
the
bible
as
true
inspired
by
god
not
all
groups
believe
that
it
is
completely
accurate


some
of
these
groups
may
think
that
the
bible
is
a
collection
of
stories
meant
to
show
who
god
is
or
even
just
the
opinions

humans

the
issue
of
who
is
a
christian


can
be
very
controversial


christians
often
disagree
over
this
issue
due
to
their
differences
in
opinion
on
spiritual
matters


it

not

provide
a
statement

doctrines
such
as
the
belief
that
<collocation>jesus christ</collocation>
is
god
or
that
god
consists
of
the
father
son
and
spirit
are
not
common
to
people
who
claim
christianity
as
their
religion


fact
date
august
many
christians
choose
to
go
to
church


most
christians
believe
this
to
be
a
sign
of
their
religious
devotion
to
god
and
an
act
of
worship


however
some
christian
groups
think
that
one
can
be
a
christian
without
ever
going
to
a
church


though
there
are
many
different
viewpoints
on
the
issue
most
protestants
believe
all
christians
are
part
of
the
spiritual
church
of
christ
whether
or
not

christians
go

turns

rennet
is
then
used

vegetarian
alternatives

distance

in

words
the

all

mathematicians
use

cubans
stopped
the
amendment
but
the
americans
still
had
a
big
say
in
cuban
politics


americans
owned
most
of
cuba
businesses


the
americans
supported
the
leader
who
was
seen
by
many
cubans
as
corrupt


cuban
revolution
in
fidel
castro
led
a
revolution
against


castro
took
power
of
cuba
with
che
from
argentina
his
brother
and
others
who
fought
against


castro
made
many
changes
to
cuba
and
ended
american
ownership
of
cuban
businesses


this
made
castro
unpopular
in
america
and
the
united
states
banned
all
contact
with
cuba


many
cubans
also
went
to
america
because
of
this


in
the
americans
helped
some
of
these
cubans
to
attack
cuba
and
remove
castro
but
they
failed


castro
then
asked
the
soviet
union
to
help
defend
them
from
the
americans
which
they
did


the
soviet
union
put
nuclear
weapons
in
cuba
and
aimed
them
at
america


american
president
kennedy
demanded
that
they
be
removed
or
a
new
war
would
begin


this
was
known
as
the
<collocation>cuban missile</collocation>
crisis


the
soviet
union
then
removed
the
missiles
when
the
united
states
agreed
to
not
continue
attacking
cuba
and
remove
missiles
from
turkey


cuba
became
a
communist
led
country
like
the
soviet
union
after
this


the
soviet
union
bought
most
of
cuba
sugar
for
expensive
prices


cuba
spent
this
money
on
health
education
and
the
army


this
made
cuba
schools
and
hospitals
some
of
the
best
in
the
world
and
the
army
fought
in
africa
to
support
black
africans
against
the
white
south
african
army


cuba
also
supported
groups
in
south
america
fighting
against
the
dictators
of
those
countries


however
the
cuban
government
began
to
control
most
of
life
in
cuba
under
the
communist
system


disagreeing
with
the
cuban
government
and
fidel
castro
in
public
was
not
allowed


some
cubans
did
not
like
this
and
tried
to
leave
cuba


most
cubans
who
left
went
to
america


some
cubans
who
did
not
like
the
government
and
stayed
were
put
in
jail


many
groups
from
around
the
world
protested
against
cuba
because
of
this
and
demanded
that
fidel
castro
give
up
power


in
the
soviet
union
collapsed


this
meant
that
cuba
which
had
sold
most
of
its
products
to
the
soviet
union
had
no
money
coming
into
the
country


the
americans
made
the
restrictions
against
contact
with
cuba
tighter


america
said
the
restrictions
on
contact
would
continue
unless
fidel
castro
gave
up
power


cuba
became
very
poor
