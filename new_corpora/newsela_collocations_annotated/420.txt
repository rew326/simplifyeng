astrophysics
is
the
study
of
how
stars
and
planets
work
and
how
we
can
learn
about
them


astrophysicists
use
physics
to
explain
what
astronomers
find
and
see


astrophysics
is
also
the
study
of
how
the
universe
started
and
how
it
is
changing
with
time


this
part
of
astrophysics
is
called
cosmology


history
a
long
time
ago
during
the
time
of
the
ancient
greeks
people
thought
that
the
way
things
worked
in
the
sky
was
different
from
the
way
things
worked
on
earth


they
also
thought
that
they
could
not
study
how
things
in
the
sky
worked


this
was
because
they
could
not
do
experiments
with
things
in
the
sky
but
they
could
do
experiments
with
things
that
are
on
the
surface
of
the
earth


when
people
realized
that
by
looking
at
the
sky
they
were
able
to
work
out
how
the
planets
moved
the
science
of
astrophysics
was
born


the
first
people
to
write
books
on
how
they
thought
the
planets
moved
were
copernicus
galileo
and
johannes


sir
<collocation>isaac newton</collocation>
realized
that
the
same
rules
of
mechanics
that
he
had
found
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
also
could
be
used
to
predict
how
the
planets
moved


he
said
as
above
so
below


by
this
he
meant
that
we
can
study
how
things
work
on
this
planet
to
find
out
how
things
work
in
space


later
scientists
found
that
by
looking
at
the
light
from
stars
they
were
able
to
work
out
what
they
were
made
from


this
process
is
called
spectroscopy


types
of
astrophysics
there
are
two
main
types
of
astrophysics
<collocation>observational astrophysics</collocation>
and
<collocation>theoretical astrophysics</collocation>


<collocation>observational astrophysics</collocation>
is
like
astronomy


like
astronomers
observational
astrophysicists
use
telescopes
to
study
the
universe
but
observational
astrophysicists
study
the
physics
of
what
they
see
to
explain
the
universe


theoretical
astrophysicists
use
information
from
astronomers
and
tools
such
as
computers
to
explain
how
the
universe
works


cosmology
is
a
type
of
<collocation>theoretical astrophysics</collocation>


word
order
is
a
part
of
grammar


it
has
to
do
with
the
order
words
are
in
a
sentence


the
word
order
is
often
different
between
languages


for
example
in
english
people
say
i
only
play
tennis
sometimes


in
german
they
would
say
ich
tennis
which
if
they
translate
only
the
words
says
i
play
only
sometimes
tennis


in
norwegian
that
same
sentence
would
be
spiller
bare
tennis
ganger
directly
translated
to
i
play
only
tennis
some
times
in
english


in
portuguese
this
sentence
could
be
eu
translating
each
word
to
english
i
only
play
tennis
some
times


or
even
in
portuguese
people
can
change
the
word
order
to
eu
i
play
tennis
only
some
times
but
they
can
not
say
eu
because
this
means
i
play
only
tennis
sometimes


subject
object
and
verb
in
english
a
simple
sentence
with
a
verb
an
action
subject
who
or
what
is
doing
the
action
and
an
object
whom
or
what
the
action
is
done
to
is
written
in
a
word
order


for
example
in
the
sentence
robert
opens
the
door
robert
is
the
subject
opens
is
the
verb
and
door
is
the
object


in
other
languages
sentences
like
this
can
be
in
different
orders


for
example
in
latin
that
sentence
could
be
written
robert
literally
robert
the
door
opens


it
could
even
be
written
robert


languages
that
let
you
choose
how
to
order
the
words
often
have
a
grammatical
case
system


in
that
sentence
is
the
case
of
door


case
means
that
the
noun
is
the
object
of
the
sentence


robert
is
in
the
<collocation>nominative case</collocation>
which
means
that
it
is
the
subject
of
the
sentence


in
english
changing
the
word
order
to
the
door
opens
robert
will
change
the
meaning
of
the
sentence


in
latin
however
robert
and
robert
mean
the
same
thing
because
is
in
the
case
so
it
is
the
object
and
robert
is
the
subject


changing
the
cases
of
the
words
however
to
will
change
the
meaning
of
the
sentence
is
now
in
the
<collocation>nominative case</collocation>
so
it
is
the
subject
and
robert
is
now
the
object
