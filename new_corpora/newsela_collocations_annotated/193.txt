a
white
dwarf
is
a
compact
star


their
matter
is
squashed
together


gravitation
has
pulled
the
atoms
close
together
and
stripped
off
their
electrons


the
mass
of
a
white
dwarf
mass
is
similar
to
that
of
the
sun
but
its
volume
is
similar
to
that
of
the
earth


white
dwarfs
are
the
final
evolutionary
state
of
all
stars
whose
mass
is
not
high
enough
to
become
a
neutron
star


over
of
the
stars
in
the
milky
way
will
become
white
dwarf
stars


after
the
hydrogen
fusing
lifetime
of
a
star
ends
it
will
expand
to
a
red
giant
which
fuses
helium
to
carbon
and
oxygen
in
its
core


if
a
red
giant
has
not
enough
mass
to
fuse
carbon
around
billion
k
inactive
carbon
and
oxygen
will
build
up
at
its
center


after
shedding
its
outer
layers
to
form
a
<collocation>planetary nebula</collocation>
it
will
leave
behind
the
core
which
is
the
white
dwarf


the
material
in
a
white
dwarf
no
longer
undergoes
fusion
reactions
so
the
star
has
no
source
of
energy


it
is
not
supported
by
the
heat
of
fusion
against
gravitational
collapse


a
star
like
our
sun
will
become
a
white
dwarf
when
it
has
run
out
of
fuel


near
the
end
of
its
life
it
will
go
through
a
red
giant
stage
and
then
lose
most
of
its
gas
until
what
is
left
contracts
and
becomes
a
young
white
dwarf

history
white
dwarfs
were
discovered
in
the
century


the
first
white
dwarf
star
called
b
was
discovered
on
january
by
william
herschel


it
is
part
of
a
three
star
system
called


the
second
white
dwarf
was
discovered
in
a
small
star
near
the
star
sirius


this
companion
star
called
<collocation>sirius b</collocation>
had
a
surface
temperature
of
about
kelvin
so
it
was
thought
of
as
a
hot
star


however
<collocation>sirius b</collocation>
was
about
times
fainter
than
the
primary
sirius
a


scientists
have
discovered
that
the
mass
of
<collocation>sirius b</collocation>
is
almost
the
same
as
that
of
the
sun


this
means
that
once
<collocation>sirius b</collocation>
was
a
star
similar
to
our
own
sun


in
van
discovered
a
white
dwarf
which
is
called
van
star


it
was
the
third
white
dwarf
to
be
discovered


it
is
the
closest
white
dwarf
to
earth
except
for
sirius
its
radiation
and
temperature
a
white
dwarf
has
low
luminosity
total
amount
of
light
given
off
but
a
very
hot
core


the
core
might
be
k
while
the
surface
is
only
a
white
dwarf
is
very
hot
when
it
is
formed
but
since
it
has
no
source
of
energy
it
will
gradually
radiate
away
its
energy
and
cool


this
means
that
its
radiation
which
gives
it
a
blue
or
white
color
at
the
start
lessens
over
time


over
a
very
long
time
a
white
dwarf
will
cool
to
temperatures
at
which
it
will
no
longer
emit
light


unless
the
white
dwarf
gets
matter
from
a
companion
star
or
some
other
source
its
radiation
comes
from
its
stored
heat


this
is
not
replaced


white
dwarfs
cool
slowly
for
two
reasons


they
have
an
extremely
small
surface
area
to
radiate
this
heat
from
so
they
cool
gradually
remaining
hot
for
a
long
time


also
they
are
very
opaque


the
<collocation>degenerate matter</collocation>
that
makes
up
the
bulk
of
a
white
dwarf
has
a
very
<collocation>low opacity</collocation>
in
other
words
it
does
not
lose
heat
and
light
much
by
radiation


eventually
all
white
dwarfs
will
cool
down
into
black
dwarfs
so
called
because
they
lack
the
energy
to
create
light


no
black
dwarfs
exist
yet
because
it
takes
longer
than
the
current
age
of
the
universe
for
a
white
dwarf
to
cool
down


a
black
dwarf
is
what
will
be
left
of
the
star
after
all
of
its
energy
heat
and
light
is
used
up


white
dwarfs
may
and
explode
as
supernovas
if
they
get
more
material


there
is
a
maximum
mass
for
a
white
dwarf
to
remain
stable


this
is
known
as
the
limit


a
dwarf
might
pull
in
material
from
a
companion
star
for
example
bringing
it
over
the
limit


the
extra
mass
would
start
a
reaction


astronomers
think
this
might
be
the
cause
of
type
ia
supernovas

such

even
though
the
media
show
this
differently
studies
have
shown
that
people
with

statistically
violence
is
often
caused
by
factors
such
as
drug
abuse
or
those
related
to
the
personal
social
and
economic
situation


findings
show
that
people
with

that
live
in

community
will
be
victims
of
violence
more
often
that

a
study
that
looked
at
people
diagnosed

<collocation>mental illness</collocation>
living
in

area
found

quarter

victims
of
at

one
violent
crime
over
the
course
of
a
year
this
proportion
was
eleven
times
higher
than
the
average


for
people
which
have
been
diagnosed
with
a
<collocation>mental illness</collocation>
it
is
more
difficult
to
get
a
trial
started
because
fewer
people
believe
them
and
many
people
have
a
prejudice
against
people
with
a
<collocation>mental illness</collocation>


there
are
a
few
specific
diagnoses
which
are
defined
by
conduct
problems
and
violence


these
include
conditions
such
as
<collocation>childhood conduct</collocation>
disorder
<collocation>adult antisocial</collocation>
personality
disorder
or
psychopathy


there
are
findings
about
how
much
specific
symptoms
are
linked
to
an
increase
in
violent
behavior


these
symptoms
include
psychosis
hallucinations
or
delusions
that
can
occur
in
disorders
such
as
schizophrenia
<collocation>delusional disorder</collocation>
or
mood
disorder


the
factors
that
lead
to
violent
behavior
are
more
often
demographic
or
in
nature
such
as
being
young
male
of
<collocation>lower socioeconomic</collocation>
status
or
of
abusing
drugs
including
alcoholism
to
which
some
people
are
particularly
vulnerable


cases
have
led
to
fears
that
serious
crimes
such
as
homicide
have
increased

people
with

<collocation>mental illnesses</collocation>
are
not
treated
in
specialized
institutions

the
evidence
does
not
support
this
conclusion


violence
that
does
occur
in

mental

against
the
mentally

by
the

typically
occurs
in
the

it

for

women


signs
and
symptoms
there
are
many
signs
that
a
person
may
be
suffering
from
depression


one
of
the
most
common
is
a
<collocation>depressed mood</collocation>
which
includes
feeling
sad
and
having
less
interest
or
pleasure
in
things
that
are
normally
enjoyable


other
core
causes
include
low
guilt
tiredness
anxiety
or
pessimism
and
sometimes
thinking
about
suicide


some
changes
are
more
physical
such
as
changes
in
how
much
and
when
a
person
eats
and
sleeps
misusing
drugs
or
alcohol
or
complaining
of
mental
or
physical
fatigue


depression
in
children
is
harder
to
see


children
who
are
depressed
may
have
a
loss
of
appetite
meaning
that
they
do
not
want
to
eat


they
may
also
be
clearly
having
more
trouble
in
everyday
life
than
before


this
can
include
sleep
problems
such
as
nightmares
new
problems
with
behavior
or
grades
at

being
more
agitated

easily
irritable
than

depression
is
a
syndrome
of
many
symptoms
that
relate
to
each
other
and
is
not
just
feeling
sad


medical
measurements
have
shown
that
there
are
big
changes
in
the
chemicals
in
the
brain
and
that
the
whole
brain
slows
down
during
depression


depression
that
is

get
worse

is
also

also
be
called
<collocation>affective disorder</collocation>


there
are
many
of
depression
melancholia

depression
is
very
severe
bad


it
can
cause
many
physical
changes
like
sleep

appetite
changes
weight

and
withdrawal
from
other
people


<collocation>psychotic depression</collocation>
is
much
like
melancholia
but
with
hallucinations
or
delusions


atypical
depression
causes
anxiety
and
panic
attacks


chronic
disorder
is
a
mild
depression
that
lasts
for
at
least
two
years


it
often
begins
in
adolescence
and
lasts
for
many
years


seasonal
<collocation>affective disorder</collocation>
sad
is
when
the
depression
seems
to
be
tied
to
the
winter
season


it
usually
starts
in

autumn
and
goes

in

causes
of
depression
depression
comes
from
the
brain
but
scientists
are
still
trying
to
find
out
exactly
why
it
happens


these
things
can
cause
depression

make
it
worse

is
known
to
often
be
inherited
meaning
that

much
more
likely
to
get
it

if
they
are

has
it
