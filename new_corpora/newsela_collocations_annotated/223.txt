in

a
house
is
a
building
that
is
made
for
people
to
live
in


it
is
a
permanent
building
that
is
meant
to
stay
standing


it
is
not
a
place
to
live
that
can
be
easily
packed
up
and
carried
away
like
a
tent
or
moved
like
a
caravan


if
people
live
in
the
same
house
for
more
than
a
short
stay
then
they
call
it
their
home


houses
come
in
many
different
shapes
and
sizes


they
may
be
as
small
as
just
one
room
or
they
may
have
hundreds
of
rooms


they
also
come
in
many
different
shapes
and
may
have
just
one
level
or
several
different
levels


a
house
is
sometimes
joined
to
other
houses
at
the
sides
to
make
row
houses
but
it
is
not
part
of
a
big
building
with
lots
of
levels


that
type
of
home
is
called
an
apartment
or
a
flat
or
a
unit


one
of
the
differences
between
a
house
and
an
apartment
is
that
a
house
has
a
front
door
to
the
outside
world
whereas
the
main
door
of
an
apartment
usually
opens
onto
a
passage
or
landing
that
can
be
used
by
other
people
in
the
building


houses
have
a
roof
to
keep
off
the
rain
and
sun
and
walls
to
keep
out
the
wind
and
cold


they
have
window
openings
to
let
in
light
and
a
floor


houses
of
different
countries
look
different
to

a
house
is
a
building
for
people
to
live
in


it
is
usually
built
for
a
family
parents
and
their
children
to
live
in


most
modern
houses
have
special
areas
or
rooms
for
a
person
or
a
family
group
to
do
the
things
that
they
need
to
live
comfortably


a
modern
house
has
a
place
to
cook
food
a
place
to
eat
places
to
sleep
and
a
place
to
wash


these
things
are
usually
done
in
separate
rooms
which
are
called
the
kitchen
the
sitting
room
the
bedrooms
the
bathroom
and
the
toilet
or
lavatory


many
houses
have
a

<collocation>dining room</collocation>
for
eating
meals
and
a

laundry


in
some
houses
the
toilet
is
in
the

and
in
other
houses
it
is
separate


many
houses
may
also
have
a
study
or
computer
room
and
a
family
room
where
the
children
can
play
games
and
watch
television


detached
house
in
some
countries
such
as
the
united
states
canada
australia
and
new
zealand
many
families
live
in
a
detached
house
which
is
separate
from
other
buildings
and
surrounded
by
its
own
yard
but
is
close
enough
to
town
to
have
shops
good
transport
and
entertainment
nearby


in
many
other
countries
including
most
of
europe
owning
a
house
like
this
is
something
that
only
the
richer
families
can
afford
and
is
just
a
dream
for
most
people

they
often
have
to
share
a

with
many
other
families
and
have
to
do
the

outside


the
house
might
be
made
of
materials
that
can
be
found
nearby
like
mud
bricks
and
grass
or
from
materials
like
corrugated

there
are
thousands
of
small
houses
crowded

with
narrow
alleys

cottage
a
small

is
often
called
a

this
word
comes
from

a
house
that
has
one
main
storey
with
a
second

are
usually
found
in

in
the
countryside


they
are
nearly
always
built

material
that
can
be

nearby


in

is
used
to
mean

just
one
big
roof


each
house
has
a
pathway
to
one
side
leading
from
the
front
to
the
backyard


houses
are
very
common
in
some
cities
and
can
be
single

or
several

high


a
which
is
sometimes
called
a
<collocation>terrace house</collocation>
see
the

in
the
introduction
is
a
house
that
is
part
of
a
row
of
houses
which
are
joined
at
the
side
walls


many
cities
and
towns
have
thousands
of
row
houses
because
they
are
a
good
way
to
build
lots
of
houses
close
together


many
row
houses
have
two
<collocation>rooms downstairs</collocation>
and
two
<collocation>rooms upstairs</collocation>
with
a
kitchen
or
wash
area
out

houses
like
this
were
built
for
poor
factory
workers
and
coal
miners
in
many
cities
and
towns


are
not
always
small


some

bungalow
a
bungalow
in
sydney
in
some
places
the
word
bungalow
is
used
for
any
house
that
is
all
on
one
level


the
word
came
from
india
and
for
a
long
time
was
used
for
a
house
that
is
built
all
on
one
level
and
has
a
verandah
where
people
can
sit
or
work
outdoors
but
under
a
shady
roof


a
bungalow
often
has
a
hall
down
the
middle
of
the
house
to
let
the
<collocation>breeze blow</collocation>
through


bungalows
are

parts
of
the

in
regions
with
flooding
a
bungalow
is
often
built
up
on
wooden
stilts
or
a
high
basement


in
the
bungalows
were
nearly
always
built
of
wood
but
from
the
it
became
fashionable
to
build
them
of
brick
as
well


a
farmhouse
in
belgium
farmhouse
a
farmhouse
may
look
like
a
cottage
a
bungalow
or
a
mansion
but
in
many
countries
a
farmhouse
can
look
quite
different
to
a
house
in
a
town
because
as
well
as
having
a
place
for
people
to
live
it
also
has
a
place
for
animals


three
typical
types
of
farmhouses
are
found


many
farm
houses
are
long
and
have
two
doors


one
door
leads
to
the
rooms
used
by
the
family


the
other
door
opens
into
a
stable
for
the
cows
sheep
and
chickens


the
stable
part
often
has
a
loft
where
hay
can
be
kept
to
feed
the
animals
in
the
winter


another
type
of
farmhouse
has
two
storeys
with
a
big
stable
and
storeroom
underneath
with
the
rooms
for
the
family
on
the
upper
floor


another
type
of
farmhouse
has
buildings
such
as
the
family
house
the
barn
and
the
stable
all
joined
together
around
a
central
courtyard


<collocation>old farmhouses</collocation>
of
these
three
types
can
be
found
in
many
parts
of
europe
and
great
britain


mansion
a
mansion
in
netherlands
a
mansion
is
a
big
grand
house
usually
with
two
storeys
and
sometimes
more


a
mansion
often
has
beautiful
architecture
and
shows
that
the
person
for
whom
it
was
designed
and
built
was
rich


mansions
often
have
beautiful
gardens


sometimes
a
mansion
does
not
belong
to
a
private
family
but
to
a
town
council
to
a
big
business
company
to
a
church
or
college
and
is
a
place
for
a
person
with
an
important
job
to
live
and
to
entertain
guests


a
mansion
often
has
rooms
which
are
not
found
in
ordinary
houses
such
as
a
drawing
room
a
ballroom
a
library
and
a
music
room


mansions
often
need
servants
to
help
keep
them
in
order
and
there
are
often
special
rooms
where
the
servants
do
particular
jobs
such
as
cleaning
the
<collocation>silver tableware</collocation>


mansions
are
the

washington
where
the

lives
and

where
the

lives


house
is
really
a
palace


palace
a
palace
is
a
house
that
is
very
grand


palaces
are
some
of
the
most
famous
and
beautiful
houses
in
the
world


they
have
often
been
built
by
people
who
were
extremely
rich
and
who
wanted
to
leave
behind
them
a
sign
that
their
family
was
important


some
palaces
have
taken
a
long
time
to
build


they
have
been
changed
and
added
to
by
different
family
members
or
changed
by
people
from
different
families
that
have
owned
them
over
many
hundreds
of
years


one
of
the
palaces
in
the
world
is
palace
where
the
monarch
of
england
who
is
currently
queen
elizabeth
ii
lives


the
largest
palace
in
the
world
is
the
louvre
which
was
built
in
paris
for
the
kings
of
france


it
now
holds
a
famous
art
gallery


what
are
houses
built
from


houses
are
usually
built
from
types
of
material
that
can
easily
be
made
or
bought
near
the
place
where
the
house
is
built


because
of
this
old
houses
in
different
towns
and
different
villages
look
quite
different
to
each
other
even
in
the
same
country


in
modern
times
building
materials
can
be
transported
easily
and
this
means
that
a
builder
has
much
more
choice
about
the
types
of
material
to
use
for
a
house


mud
and
clay
a
farmhouse
in
venezuela
made
of
wooden
slats
and
<collocation>clay daub</collocation>


in
many
parts
of
the
world
mud
or
clay
are
the
main
building
materials


clay
is
a
type
of
soil
that
sticks
together
more
strongly
than
most
other
types
of
soil


there
are
three
main
ways
of
building
walls
with
mud
and
clay


one
way
to
make
a
house
of
clay
is
simply
to
pile
up
the
mud
or
wet
clay
with
the
hands
and
flatten
it
into
a
wall
shape


often
animal
hair
straw
and
dung
is
mixed
with
the
mud
so
that
the
fibers
stringy
bits
help
hold
it
together


some
<collocation>wooden beams</collocation>
and
thin
wooden
slats
are
used
to
hold
the
roof
which
is
also
made
of
mud
or
clay


the
roof
is
flat
and
strong
enough
to
walk
on
but
must
slope
a
bit
in
case
of
rain


the
walls
are
often
protected
from
rain
with
plaster
and
paint


in
many
countries
the
walls
are
white
but
in
other
places
all
the
houses
are
painted
different
bright


these
types
of
houses
are
only
found
in
very
dry
countries


houses
built
in
this
way
give
good
protection
against
the
very
hot
sun
and
hot
dry
winds
of
the
dessert


in
the
cold
nights
they
stay
quite
warm


a
second
way
to
make
the
walls
of
a
house
out
of
mud
of
clay
is
wattle
and
daub


wattle
is
weaving
from
sticks


first
long
sticks
are
stuck
into
the
ground
and
then
very
thin
sticks
are
woven
through
them
like
making
a
basket


the
<collocation>thin wattle</collocation>
wall
is
then
or
stuck
all
over
on
the
inside
and
the
outside
with
damp
clay
mud
or
plaster
usually
with
some
chopped
straw
or
animal
hair
to
help
it
stick
together


wattle
and
daub
are
often
found
in
quite
damp
places
where
bendy
<collocation>willow trees</collocation>
or
also
called
wattle
trees
grow


the
walls
need
good
protection
from
the
rain
so
houses
like
this
often
have
roofs
that
have
big
eaves
the
roof
sticks
out
all
around
the
house
so
that
the
water
does
not
run
down
the
walls


wattle
and
daub
houses
often
have
big
roofs
made
of
straw
reeds
banana
leaves
palm
leaves
wooden
shingles
or
big
sheets
of
bark


another
way
to
make
a
house
of
mud
or
clay
is
to
shape
the
wet
soil
into
bricks
before
building
the
walls


the
bricks
can
be
shaped
by
hand
but
more
often
they
are
shaped
in
boxes
or
moulds
so
that
all
the
bricks
are
just
the
same
size
and
shape


they
are
left
in
the
hot
sun
until
they
have
dried
hard


then
walls
can
be
made
which
are
the
same
thickness
all
the
way
up


clay
bricks
that
are
dried
in
the
sun
were
used
in
egypt
and
mesopotamia
for
thousands
of
years


brick
and
<collocation>tile houses</collocation>
in
england
fired
bricks
it
was
discovered
that
if
clay
was
used
rather
than
mud
very
strong
bricks
could
be
made
by
firing
or
baking
them
in
a
kiln
a
special
oven


fired
bricks
were
like
pottery
they
did
not
wash
away
easily
when
they
got
rained
on
and
would
sometimes
last
for
thousands
of
years


the
bricks
were
joined
to
each
other
with
a
type
of
cement
called
mortar


some
houses
built
by
the
ancient
romans
are
still
standing
years
later


bricks
became
one
of
the
most
common
building
materials


in
most
cities
nearly
all
the
houses
are
built
of
bricks
because
they
are
long
lasting
they
do
not
need
repairing
very
often


brick
houses
are
generally
made
strong
by
having
all
the
main
walls
two
bricks
thick


two
walls
are
built
side
by
side
which
are
bonded
or
joined
to
each
other
by
having
some
bricks
set
so
they
make
a
bridge
between
the
two
layers


the
pattern
of
the
bonded
bricks
can
be
seen
from
the
outside


the
two
main
patterns
are
called
flemish
bond
and
british
bond


the
tall
narrow
city
houses
of
are
painted
in
different
colors


because
brick
walls
are
heavy
a
brick
house
needs
to
have
a
very
firm
base
or
foundation
to
sit
on


this
often
means
digging
deep
into
the
ground
to
lay
a
foundation
before
a
brick
house
can
be
built


houses
with
brick
walls
often
have
tiled
roofs
because
the
tiles
can
often
be
made
at
the
brick
factory


modern
bricks
and
tiles
come
in
a
big
range
of
colors
because
different
materials
can
be
transported
from
different
areas


people
who
are
employing
a
builder
to
build
a
home
are
nowadays
often
shown
pictures
of
all
the
colors
of
bricks
and
tiles
that
are
available


this
means
that
although
in
old
towns
every
house
is
made
of
the
same
type
of
bricks
in
a
modern
suburb
every
house
may
look
quite
different


the
bricks
range
from
white
through
shades
of
red
yellow
and
brown
and
are
sometimes
very
patterned
while
the
<collocation>roof tiles</collocation>
include
blue
green
and
yellow
as
well
as
the
traditional
red
orange
and
brown


in
some
countries
the
clay
for
bricks
does
not
set
very
hard
and
washes
away
more
easily


if
the
bricks
are
not
very
hard
then
it
is
usual
to
cover
them
with
plaster
or
cement
which
can
then
be
painted


in
other
places
brick
walls
are
not
very
fashionable
so
the
walls
are
plastered
and
made
more
elegant
with
decoration


plastering
or
over
brickwork
is
called
render
or
stucco


in
many
countries
such
as
austria
italy
and
spain
the
brick
houses
are
usually
covered
with
stucco
and
are
often
painted

<collocation>historic timber</collocation>
house
in
texas
<collocation>timber houses</collocation>
made
of
timber
are
found
wherever
there
are
or
there
has
once
been
big
forests


<collocation>timber houses</collocation>
are
also
often
found
in
seaside
towns
where
the
sea
air
makes
brick
and
stone
houses
feel
cold
and
damp


one
of
the
oldest
ways
to
make
a
timber
house
is
to
cut
into
logs


the
logs
are
then
split
in
half
so
that
there
is
a
flat
side
for
the
inside
of
the
wall
and
a
round
side
for
the
outside


the
logs
then
have
big
notches
or
holes
cut
into
the
ends
so
that
when
they
are
piled
up
they
<collocation>logs lock</collocation>
together
at
the
corners
of
the
building
without
any
nails


houses
like
this
can
be
seen
in
canada
in
switzerland
in
scandinavia
in
eastern
europe
and
in
japan


many
houses
are
made
with
a
wooden
frame
or
skeleton


on
the
outside
of
the
frame
to
keep
out
the
weather
rows
of
flat
boards
are
nailed
which
overlap
each
other
so
that
the
rain
can
not
come
in


walls
like
this
are
called
clapboard
or


<collocation>clapboard houses</collocation>
are
generally
painted
to
preserve
the
timber


in
england
and
some
parts
of
the
united
states
they
are
nearly
always
painted
white


in
australia
where
houses
are
very
common
they
are
usually
painted
in
bright
colors


in
england
and
australia
<collocation>clapboard houses</collocation>
are
usually
quite
small
but
in
the
united
states
there
are
very
many
<collocation>grand mansions</collocation>
that
are
built
in
this
way


some
houses
with
a
<collocation>wooden frame</collocation>
have
a
brick
wall
on
the
outside
and
a
wall
of
plastered
board
on
the
inside


this
is
called
brick
veneer


a
farmhouse
in
germany
houses
a
type
of
house
is
the
house


these
are
seen
in
the
british
isles
france
and
across
northern
europe
and
the
alps


these
houses
date
mainly
from
about
to
about


houses
are
houses
that
have
a
<collocation>wooden frame</collocation>
built
up
of
lots
of
thick
timber
pieces
that
are
generally
quite
short


the
timbers
are
arranged
in
a
pattern
with
lots
of
diagonal
pieces
to
act
as
braces


the
strong
<collocation>wooden frame</collocation>
is
then
filled
in
with
all
sorts
of
other
material


in
some
houses
the
is
mainly
of
brick


in
other
houses
wattle
and
daub
is
used
between
the
timber


other
houses
have
of
rubble
rough
stones
in
clay
or
mud


the
is
generally
plastered
over
and
painted
white
or
in
some
places
a
color
while
the
timbers
are
often
stained
black


if
they
are
not
stained
they
turn
pale
<collocation>silvery gray</collocation>


hundreds
of
these
houses
exist
including
some
that
are
quite
grand


in
the
and
early
there
was
a
fashion
to
copy
on
modern
brick
houses


a
cottage
of
undressed
stone
with
brick
chimneys
in
australia
a
cottage
of
dressed
stone
in
scotland
stone
houses
in
places
where
there
is
lots
of
stone
many
houses
are
built
of
it


in
many
parts
of
the
world
little
cottages
are
built
of
stone


many
mansions
and
palaces
are
also
built
of
stone


some
of
the
oldest
houses
in
the
world
are
made
of
stone


they
are
circular
houses
with
walls
of
flat
stone
slabs
laid
carefully
on
each
other


the
<collocation>walls sloped</collocation>
gently
inwards
to
meet
in
a
stone
roof


other
prehistoric
stone
houses
had
roofs
of
thatch


in
parts
of
the
world
where
there
is
stone
that
can
be
broken
into
flat
slabs
then
walls
can
be
built
up
without
any
mortar
to
join
the
stones
together


but
the
wind
blows
through
the
gaps
so
the
walls
need
timber
or
render
on
the
inside
to
keep
out
the
weather


stone
houses
of
this
type
often
have
roofs
made
of
flat
stones
as
well


stone
roofs
are
very
heavy
and
are
laid
on
very
<collocation>thick beams</collocation>


many
stone
cottages
are
built
of
flint
or
rubble
or
cobble


these
are
broken
stones
that
are
brought
from
nearby
hills
or
stones
picked
up
from
the
farmer
fields
or
gathered
from
a
river
bed


the
walls
are
built
up
with
stones
and
mortar


in
some
places
where
flint
is
used
the
hard
stones
are
split
or
so
that
when
they
are
placed
on
the
outside
of
the
wall
they
show
a
shiny
flat
surface
which
is
more
attractive
than
the
dull
lumpy
outside
of
a
flintstone


some
types
of
stone
particularly
limestone
and
sandstone
can
easily
be
cut
into
big
blocks
that
can
be
built
up
like
bricks


it
can
also
be
dressed
or
smoothed
on
its
surfaces


in
villages
that
are
near
a
limestone
or
sandstone
quarry
where
the
stone
is
cut
many
of
the
cottages
are
built
of
neatly
cut
stones


but
in
towns
that
are
far
away
from
the
quarries
it
is
only
the
mansions
and
palaces
that
are
built
of
stone
because
it
is
very
heavy
and
expensive
to
carry
across
the
country


the
good
thing
about
the
types
of
stone
that
are
used
for
grand
houses
is
that
they
can
easily
be
carved
into
decoration


grand
houses
often
have
decorative
carvings
around
the
doors
and
windows


the
building
stones
may
also
have
special
textures
at
the
basement
or
the
corners
of
the
building


grand
stone
houses
often
have
roofs
of
thin
stone
called
slate


they
also
have
roofs
of
expensive
materials
like
copper
and
lead

houses
