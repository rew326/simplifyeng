if
is
called
a
natural
number
then
the
natural
numbers
are
the
same
as
the
whole
numbers


if
is
not
called
a
natural
number
then
the
natural
numbers
are
the
same
as
the
counting
numbers


so
if
the
words
natural
numbers
are
not
used
then
there
will
be
less
confusion
about
whether
zero
is
included
or
not


but
unfortunately
some
say
that
zero
is
not
a
whole
number
either
and
some
say
whole
numbers
can
be
negative


<collocation>positive integers</collocation>
and
integers
are
another
way
to
include
zero
or
exclude
zero
but
only
if
people
know
those
words


negative
numbers
negative
numbers
are
numbers
less
than
zero


one
way
to
think
of
negative
numbers
is
using
a
number
line


we
call
one
point
on
this
line
zero


then
we
will
label
write
the
name
of
every
position
on
the
line
by
how
far
to
the
right
of
the
zero
point
it
is
for
example
the
point
one
is
one
centimeter
to
the
right
the
point
two
is
two
centimeters
to
the
right


now
think
about
a
point
which
is
one
centimeter
to
the
left
of
the
zero
point


we
can
not
call
this
point
one
as
there
is
already
a
point
called
one


we
therefore
call
this
point
minus
as
it
is
one
centimeter
away
but
in
the
opposite
direction

all
the
normal
operations
of
mathematics
can
be
done
with
negative
numbers
if
people
add
a
negative
number
to
another
this
is
the
same
as
taking
away
the
positive
number
with
the
same
numerals


for
example
is
the
same
as
and
equals


if
they
take
away
a
negative
number
from
another
this
is
the
same
as
adding
the
positive
number
with
the
same
numerals


for
example
is
the
same
as
and
equals


if
they
multiply
two
negative
numbers
together
they
get
a
positive
number


for
example
times
is


if
they
multiply
a
negative
number
by
a
positive
number
or
multiply
a
positive
number
by
a
negative
number
they
get
a
negative
result

<collocation>rational numbers</collocation>
<collocation>rational numbers</collocation>
are
numbers
which
can
be
written
as
fractions


this
means
that
they
can
be
written
as
a
divided
by
b
where
the
numbers
a
and
b
are
integers
and
b
is
not
equal
to


some
<collocation>rational numbers</collocation>
such
as
need
a
finite
number
of
digits
after
the
decimal
point
to
write
them
in
decimal
form


the
number
one
tenth
is
written
in
decimal
form
as


numbers
written
with
a
<collocation>finite decimal</collocation>
form
are
rational


some
<collocation>rational numbers</collocation>
such
as
need
an
infinite
number
of
digits
after
the
decimal
point
to
write
them
in
decimal
form


there
is
a
repeating
pattern
to
the
digits
following
the
decimal
point


the
number
one
eleventh
is
written
in
decimal
form
as


a
percentage
could
be
called
a
rational
number
because
a
percentage
like
can
be
written
as
the
fraction


it
can
also
be
written
as
the
decimal


sometimes
a
ratio
is
considered
as
a
rational
number


<collocation>irrational numbers</collocation>
<collocation>irrational numbers</collocation>
are
numbers
which
can
not
be
written
as
a
fraction
but
do
not
have
imaginary
parts
explained
later


is
irrational


<collocation>irrational numbers</collocation>
often
occur
in
geometry


for
instance
if
we
have
a
square
which
has
sides
of
meter
the
distance
between
opposite
corners
is
the
square
root
of
two
which
equals


this
is
an
irrational
number


mathematicians
have
proved
that
the
square
root
of
every
natural
number
is
either
an
integer
or
an
irrational
number


one
irrational
number
is
pi


this
is
the
circumference
distance
around
of
a
circle
divided
by
its
diameter
distance
across


this
number
is
the
same
for
every
circle


the
number
pi
is
approximately


an
irrational
number
can
not
be
fully
written
down
in
decimal
form


it
would
have
an
infinite
number
of
digits
after
the
decimal
point


unlike
these
digits
would
not
repeat
forever


real
numbers
real
numbers
is
a
name
for
all
the
sets
of
numbers
listed
above
the
<collocation>rational numbers</collocation>
including
integers
the
<collocation>irrational numbers</collocation>
this
is
all
numbers
that
do
not
involve
<collocation>imaginary numbers</collocation>


<collocation>imaginary numbers</collocation>
<collocation>imaginary numbers</collocation>
are
formed
by
real
numbers
multiplied
by
the
number
i


this
number
is
the
square
root
of
minus
one


there
is
no
number
in
the
real
numbers
which
when
squared
makes
the
number


therefore
mathematicians
invented
a
number


they
called
this
number
i
or
the
imaginary
unit


<collocation>imaginary numbers</collocation>
operate
under
the
same
rules
as
real

the
sum
of
two
<collocation>imaginary numbers</collocation>
is
found
by
pulling
out
factoring
out
