date
december
von
a
german
robber
baron
the
term
robber
baron
was
first
used
in
the
and
centuries
to
describe
rich
men
who
lived
in
large
castles
along
major
transportation
rivers
like
the
rhine
in
europe


they
would
send
ships
out
onto
these
rivers
to
stop
anybody
who
was
traveling
through
who
did
not
know
better
and
collect
a
tax
from
them
on
any
money
or
goods
on
these
ships


they
were
not
officially
allowed
to
collect
these
taxes


it
was
only
the
holy
roman
emperor
who
could
decide
what
taxes
to
be
charged
how
much
and
who
could
charge
it


second
it
is
a
slang
term
used
of
certain
rich
and
ruthless
industrialists
and
bankers
especially
in
the
late
and
early
century


wineries
are
large
plantations
built
along
the
fertile
banks
of
major
rivers
like
the
rhine


location
the
rivers
provided
plenty
of
water
for
the
grapes
in
the
winery
allowed
easy
transportation
of
goods
carried
off
wastes
and
trash
and
kept
a
heavy
mist
over
the
river
and
the
fields
which
was
cool
and
kept
the
sun
out


the
sun
was
bad
for
the
grapes
so
it
was
good
to
keep
it
out


purpose
once
the
grapes
ripened
and
were
picked
they
were
placed
in
a
large
vat
where
workers
would
jump
in
and
crush
them
with
their
feet


the
juice
would
flow
down
to
a
conical
opening
covered
by
a
filter
which
kept
out
the
grapes


the
juice
flowed
along
a
pipe
to
a
barrel
cask
or
and
was
allowed
to
ferment
or
age
thus
allowing
wine
to
be
made

sucrose
the

sucrose


fructose
is
the

as
chemicals
sucrose
and
fructose
are
both
made
by
two
smaller
sugars


glucose
is
the
more

of
these

the
human

changes
regular
sugar
into
the
smaller

chemical

of

call

this
is

sugars
are
made

carbohydrates

be
simple

<collocation>complex carbohydrates</collocation>


simple
carbohydrates
are
made

only
one

a

of
the

<collocation>complex carbohydrates</collocation>
are
made
of
many
of
the

starch

from
many
many


starch
is
the
way
non
scientists
say
<collocation>complex carbohydrates</collocation>


when
starch
is
eaten
the
human
body
breaks
it
apart
into
smaller
sugars


this
starts
in
the
mouth


when
one
holds
a
food
with
starch
in
their
mouth
for
a
few
minutes
it
starts
to
<collocation>taste sweet</collocation>


this
is
because
the
starch
is
broken
into

that
<collocation>taste sweet</collocation>


brazil
