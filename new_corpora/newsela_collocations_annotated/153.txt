also
migrate


they
often
collect
in
<collocation>huge flocks</collocation>
of
thousands
of
birds
that
move
together
like
a
whirling
cloud


birds
that
live
in
bushes
and
branches
have
<collocation>triangular wings</collocation>
that
help
the
bird
change
direction


many
forest
birds
are
expert
at
getting
up
speed
by
flapping
and
then
gliding
steadily
among
the
trees
tilting
to
avoid
things
as
they
go


members
of
the
<collocation>kingfisher family</collocation>
are
expert
at
this
type
of
flying


birds
such
as
owls
that
hunt
at
night
have
wings
with
soft
rounded
feathers
so
that
they
do
not
flap
loudly


birds
that
are
awake
at
night
are
called
nocturnal
birds


birds
that
are
awake
during
the
day
are
diurnal


a
wandering
albatross
and
arctic
tern
might
spend
several
years
without
coming
to
land


they
can
sleep
while
gliding
and
have
wings
which
when
they
are
stretched
right
out
look
like
the
wings
of
a
<collocation>jet plane</collocation>


bird
like
chickens
that
feed
mainly
on
the
ground
and
only
use
their
wings
to
fly
to
safety
have
small
wings


<collocation>flightless birds</collocation>
some
birds
do
not
fly


these
include
running
birds
like
ostriches
and
emus
and
birds
the
large
penguin
family


ostriches
and
emus
do
not
need
to
fly
because
although
they
feed
and
nest
on
the
ground
their
great
size
and
their
speed
is
their
protection


some
other
birds
have
not
been
so
lucky


some
birds
such
as
the
dodo
and
the
kiwi
were
birds
that
lived
in
safety
on
islands
where
there
was
nothing
dangerous
to
eat
them


they
lost
the
power
of
flight


kiwis
are
endangered
because
european
settlement
to
new
zealand
brought
animals
like
cats
dogs
and
rats
which
<collocation>kill kiwis</collocation>
and
eat
their
eggs


however
kiwis
and
also
the
rare
new
zealand
<collocation>ground parrot</collocation>
have
survived


in
the
case
of
dodos
they
were
fat
and
delicious


they
were
killed
and
eaten
by
sailors
until
there
was
none
left


other
<collocation>flightless birds</collocation>
which
have
disappeared
are
the
great
auk
and
the


penguins
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
at
sea
where
they
are
in
danger
from
seals


on
land
they
usually
live
in
areas
where
there
were
few
dangers
until
the
arrival
of
european
settlers
with
dogs
and
cats


their
wings
have
adapted
to
life
in
the
sea
and
have
become
flippers
which
help
them
in
swimming
very
fast


behaviour
swans
are
mated

mating
although
birds
are
creatures
like
mammals
they
do
not
give
birth
to
live
babies


they
lay
eggs
like
lizards
do


unlike
most
reptiles
the
shell
of
a
bird
egg
is
hard


the
baby
bird
grows
inside
the
egg
and
after
a
few
weeks
breaks
out
or
hatches


birds
in
cold
climates
usually
have
a
breeding
season
once
a
year
in
the
spring


<collocation>migratory birds</collocation>
can
have
two
springs
and
two
mating
seasons
in
a
year


so
can
birds
that
live
in
hot
climates


when
the
breeding
season
arrives
the
birds
choose
partners


some
birds
are
mated
for
life
like
married
couples


these
birds
include
pigeons
geese
and
cranes


other
birds
look
for
new
partners
each
year
and
sometimes
a
male
bird
or
cock
will
have
several
wives


for
birds
that
choose
new
mates
part
of
the
breeding
season
is
display


the
male
bird
will
do
all
sorts
of
things
to
attract
females


these
include
singing
dancing
showing
off
the
feathers
and
building
a
beautiful
nest


some
male
birds
have
splendid
feathers
for
attracting
females


the
most
famous
is
the
peacock
who
can

the
feathers
above
his
tail
into
a

nesting
once
the
birds
have
found
partners
they
find
a
suitable
place
to
lay
eggs


the
idea
of
what
is
a
suitable
place
differs
between
species
but
most
build
bird
nests


robins
will
make
a
beautiful
little
round
nest
of
woven
grass
and
carefully
line
it
with
feathers
bits
of
fluff
and
other
soft
things


swallows
like
to
nest
near
other
swallows


they
make
nests
from
little
blobs
of
clay
often
on
a
beam
near
the
roof
of
a
building
where
it
is
well
sheltered


many
birds
like
a
hollow
tree
to
nest
in


eagle
nests
are
often
just
piles
of
dead
wood
on
the
top
of
the
tallest
tree
or
mountain


scrub
turkeys
scratch
together
a
huge
pile
of
leaves
that
may
be
metres
across


lay
their
eggs
on
rock
shelves
with
no
nest
at
all


their
eggs
are
shaped
so
that
they
roll
around
in
circles


a
cuckoo
does
not
make
its
own
nest


it
lays
its
egg
in
the
nest
of
another
bird
and
leaves
it
for
them
to
care
for


the
cuckoo
eggs
are
camouflaged
to
look
like
the
host
eggs


when
the
nest
has
been
prepared
the
birds
mate
so
that
the
eggs
are
and
the
chicks
will
start
growing


unlike
mammals
birds
only
have
one
opening
as
the
exit
hole
for
body
fluids
and
for
reproduction


the
opening
is
called
the
cloaca


a
female
bird
called
a
hen
has
two
ovaries
of
which
the
left
one
usually
produces
eggs


most
male
birds
have
no
sex
organs
that
can
be
seen


but
inside
the
male
are
two
testes
which
produce
sperm
which
is
stored
in
the
cloaca


birds
mate
by
rubbing
their
together
although
with
some
birds
particularly
large
water
birds
the
male
has
a
sort
of
a
penis
inside
the
cloaca


hatching
once
the
hen
has
mated
she
produces
fertile
eggs
which
have
chicks
growing
inside
them


she
lays
the
eggs
in
the
nest


there
might
be
just
one
egg
or
a
number
of
them
called
a
clutch


emus
might
lay
as
many
as
fifteen
huge
dark
green
eggs
in
a
clutch


after
the
eggs
are
laid
they
are
incubated
or
kept
warm
so
the
chicks
form
inside


most
birds
stay
together
for
the
<collocation>whole nesting</collocation>
season
and
one
advantage
is
that
the
work
is
shared


many
birds
take
turns
sitting
on
the
eggs
so
that
each
adult
can
feed


this
is
not
always
the
case


with
emus
the
male
does
all
the
sitting
and
all
the


with
emperor
penguins
it
is
also
the
male
that
cares
for
the
egg


there
is
only
one
egg
which
he
keeps
on
his
feet
and
under
his
feathers
standing
in
a
big
group
of
males
without
feeding
until
the
chick
is
hatched


while
the
eggs
are
hatching
the
females
are
at
sea
feeding
so
that
they
can
care
for
the
chicks
when
they
return


some
birds
put
the
eggs
inside
or
on
top
of
the
mound
of
leaves
and
twigs


the
<collocation>mound acts</collocation>
like
a
compost
heap


the
decomposition
of
the
rotting
leaves
causes
the
temperature
to
rise


this
is
heat
released
by
the
chemical
action
of
bacterial
and
fungal
respiration


it
is
the
same
reaction
as
that
which
keeps
mammals
and
birds
at
a
high
temperature


the
parents
leave
the
mound


when
the
<collocation>chicks hatch</collocation>
they
are
able
to
feed
themselves


many
small
birds
take
weeks
to
hatch
eggs


albatrosses
take
days


during
this
time
the
female
loses
a
lot
of
her
body
weight


the
quickest
hatching
time
is
for
the
cuckoo


some
types
of
cuckoos
take
only
days


this
means
that
when
they
hatch
in
the
nest
of
their
<collocation>foster parents</collocation>
the
eggs
that
the
parents
have
laid
are
not
yet
ready


newborn
cuckoos
are
naked
blind
and
ugly
but
they
are
strong


they
get
under
any
eggs
that
are
in
the
nest
and
throw
them
out
before
they
hatch


that
means
that
the
cuckoo
has
the
whole
care
of
both
parents


<collocation>baby cuckoos</collocation>
grow
fast
and
often
get
bigger
than
the
parents
who
feed
them


when
baby
birds
hatch
in
most
types
of
birds
they
are
fed
by
both
parents
and
sometimes
by
<collocation>older aunties</collocation>
as
well


their
mouths
are
open
all
the
time
and
are
often
very
brightly
colored
which
acts
as
a
a
trigger
which
stimulates
the
parent
to
feed
them


for
birds
that
eat
grain
and
fruit
the
parents
eat
and
partly
digest
the
food
for
the
babies

families
many
birds
particularly
those
that
mate
for
life
are
very
sociable
and
keep
together
in
a
family
group
which
might
be
anything
from
or
adult
birds
and
their
young
to
a
very
large
flock


as
chicks
grow
they
change
the
fluffy
down
that
covers
them
as
babies
for
real
feathers


at
this
stage
they
are
called


other
family
members
may
help
care
for
fledgling
chicks
feeding
them
and
protecting
them
from
attack
while
parents
are
feeding


when
the
have
their
new
feathers
they
come
out
of
the
nest
to
learn
to
fly


in
some
types
of
birds
like
pigeons
the
parents
watch
over
this
and
as
the
young
ones
get
stronger
will
give
them
flying
lessons
teaching
them
how
to
glide
how
to
fly
in
spirals
and
how
to
land
like
an
expert


flocks
flocks
of
birds
can
be
very
highly
organised
in
a
way
that
takes
care
of
all
the
flock
members


studies
of
small
flocking
birds
like
tree
sparrows
show
that
they
clearly
communicate
with
each
other
as
sometimes
thousands
of
birds
may
fly
in
close
formation
and
spiral
patterns
without
colliding
or
flying
into
each
other


two
common
behaviors
in
flocking
birds
are
guarding
and
reconnaissance


when
a
flock
of
birds
is
feeding
it
is
common
for
one
bird
to
perch
on
a
high
place
to
keep
guard
over
the
flock


in
the
same
way
when
a
flock
is
asleep
often
one
bird
will
remain
awake


it
is
also
common
for
large
flocks
to
send
one
or
two
birds
ahead
of
them
when
they
are
flying
to
a
new
area


the
birds
can
spy
the
lie
of
the
land
to
find
food
water
and
good
places
to
perch


communication
all
birds
make
sounds
to
communicate


the
types
of
noises
that
they
make
are
different


all
birds
have
cries
which
are
the
sounds
to
communicate


some
birds
can
also
sing


these
birds
are
called
songbirds


some
songbirds
are
robins
larks
canaries
nightingales
and
crows


birds
that
are
not
songbirds
are
pigeons
seagulls
eagles
owls
and
ducks


parrots
are
not
songbirds
even
though
they
can
be
taught
to
sing
human
songs

communication

studies
the
austrian
naturalist
studied
the
way
in
which
birds
communicate
or
talk
to
each
other


he
found
that
each
type
of
bird
had
a
number
of
sounds
which
they
made
automatically
when
ever
they
felt
a
certain
way


every
sound
had
an
action
that
went
with
it


so
if
the
bird
was
frightened
it
acted
frightened
and
made
a
frightened
sound


this
told
the
other
birds
around
it
that
something
frightening
was
happening


if
a
flock
of
birds
were
flying
over
a
field
they
would
be
calling
fly


but
a
hungry
bird
seeing
something
good
to
eat
down
below
might
start
calling
food


if
other
birds
were
also
hungry
they
would
make
the
same
call
until
more
birds
were
calling
food


than
fly


at
this
point
the
mind
of
the
flock
would
be
changed


some
of
the
birds
would
start
to
yell
fly
downwards


fly
downwards


as
they
sank
from
the
sky
until
the
whole
flock
was
all
noisily
calling
the
same
thing


these
communication
sounds
are
often
short
hard
sounds
like
chirps
squeaks
squawks


sometimes
the
calls
are
longer
and
more
musical


they
include
the
sound
of
a
pigeon
and
the


of
a
rooster


the
bird
can
not
change
these
sounds


they
always
make
them
in
the
same
way


the
bird
is
locked
into
making
each
sound
every
time
a
particular
idea
comes
into
its
head


the
connection
between
how
they
feel
and
how
they
call
is
innate
they
are
born
with
it


some
calls
in
some
species
are
learned


then
it
is
the
tendency
to
learn
which
is
inherited


songbirds
all
birds
make
noises
bird
but
not
all
sing


songbirds
are
many
of
which
have
<collocation>beautiful melodic</collocation>
songs


songs
have
different
functions


danger
cries
are
different
from
territorial
songs
and
mating
calls
are
a
third
type


fledgling
may
also
have
different
calls
from
adults


<collocation>recognition calls</collocation>
for
partners
are
quite
common


as
to
where
the
song
comes
from
there
are
three
kinds
of
species
those
where
the
song
is
entirely
inherited
and
the
bird
always
sings
the
same
song
in
the
same
situations


those
where
the
song
is
partly
inherited
but
the
bird
tunes
it
in
by
copying
others


in
this
case
the
<collocation>slight differences</collocation>
between
the
calls
of
different
birds
may
be
used
by
partners
for
identification


those
where
the
song
is
entirely
learned
and
the
bird
often
copies
sounds
from
its
environment


most
singing
birds
that
are
kept
as
pets
like
canaries
have
several
tunes
and
some
variations


the
same
species
of
bird
will
sing
different
songs
in
different
regions


a
good
example
of
this
is
the


this
is
an
australia
bird
which
is
like
a
black
and
white
crow


in
the
autumn
families
get
together
in
large
flocks
and
do
a
lot
of
singing


from
some
areas
sing
much
more
complex
songs
than
others


generally
from
the
blue
mountains
are
the
<collocation>finest singers</collocation>


the
song
of
the
can
be
sung
as
a
solo
but
is
often
performed
as
a
choir


one
bird
will
take
the
lead
and
sing


all
the
other
birds
will
join
in
and
sing


when
all
the
birds
know
the
song
the
choir
will
sing
the
warble
part
and
the
soloist
will
sing
the
woo


the
song
changes
from
year
to
year
and
from
place
to
place


the
jackdaw

noticed
that
when
birds
sing
they
often
use
a
lot
of
their
regular
calls
as
part
of

can
be

and
sometimes
even
the
remains

that
birds
