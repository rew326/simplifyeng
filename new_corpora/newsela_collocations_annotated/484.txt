medical
care
transgender
people
who
wish
to
take
medicine
and
have
surgery
to
change
their
bodies
face
several
problems


in
order
to
change
their
bodies
they
must
have
doctors
who
are
willing
to
help
them
and
make
the
changes


they
sometimes
can
not
do
this
because
doctors
will
not
help
them


they
may
also
not
be
able
to
do
this
because
even
if
a
doctor
would
treat
them
they
may
not
be
able
to
afford
the
medicine
or
surgery


but
the
declaration
of
<collocation>montreal affirms</collocation>
that
such
medical
care
be
provided
for
them
by
public
health
insurance


disease
versus
difference
many
transgender
people
do
not
like
being
labeled
as
having
a
disease
<collocation>gender identity</collocation>
disorder
even
though
it
is
an
accepted
diagnosis
and
a
medical
condition
that
can
only
be
treated
with
medicine
surgery
or
therapy


in
some
places
the
government
labels
being
transgender
a
disease


the
principle
of
the
principles
disagrees
with
such
medical
classifications


however
many
transgender
people
depend
on
this
diagnosis


some
people
can
only
get
medical
and
surgical
treatment
paid
for
by
their
government
if
it
is
to
treat
a
disease
so
if
it
is
not
considered
a
disease
they
will
not
get
the
medicines
and
surgery
they
need


also
some
laws
protect
transgender
people
from
and
discrimination


in
places
that
do
not
have
these
laws
transgender
people
may
only
be
protected
under
laws
that
protect
people
with
diseases
or
disabilities
so
their
condition
needs
to
be
labeled
one
of
these


doctors
do
not
agree
on
one
way
of
viewing
being
transgender


some
doctors
view
the
condition
as
a
<collocation>birth defect</collocation>
that
can
easily
be
fixed
others
may
not
even
recognize
being
transgender
as
a
medical
condition


this
argument
still
goes
on
in
both
the
transgender
community
and
in
the
medical
community
that
treats
them


violence
about
of
transgender
people
have
been
sexually
assaulted


legal
problems
transgender
people
have
problems
with
laws
and
regulations
about
sex


to
be
seen
and
treated
as
the
sex
they
wish
transgender
people
usually
have
to
change
their
first
name


they
also
may
want
to
change
their
identity
documents
to
say
the
correct
sex


for
example
a
transgender
woman
may
wish
to
change
her
birth
certificate
or
driving
license
to
say
her
new
female
name
and
to
say
that
she
is
a
female


these
changes
can
protect
transgender
people
from
discrimination


for
example
transgender
people
often
have
difficulty
traveling
because
their
appearance
does
not
match
their
identity
papers


these
changes
can
also
be
necessary
for
transgender
people
to
be
allowed
to
marry
their
spouses
in
places
where
it
is
illegal
for
homosexual
people
to
marry


these
changes
can
even
protect
transgender
people
from
a
wide
variety
of
violence


some
transgender
people
are
only
recognized
when
their
documents
reveal
them


being
revealed
as
transgender
can
put
people
in
danger
because
of
fear
and
misunderstanding
of
transgender
people


unfortunately
in
many
places
this
is
hard
or
impossible
for
transgender
people
to
change
their
identity
documents
with
or
without
undergoing
<collocation>genital surgery</collocation>
which
is
required
in
many
places
contrary
to
the
definition
of
the
principles


this
is
changing
however


recently
the
<collocation>united kingdom</collocation>
passed
the
gender
<collocation>recognition act</collocation>
of


this
act
allows
people
to
have
their
change
of
sex
officially
recognized
without
surgery


once
changed
they
have
all
the
rights
privileges
and
responsibilities
of
their
new
gender
