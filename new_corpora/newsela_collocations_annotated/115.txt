nickname

sometimes
the


this
comes
from
one
of
two
toffee
shops
that
were
near
their
stadium
at
the
time
the
club
started


both
ye
toffee
house
and
old
mother
toffee
shop
claim
to
have
started
off
the
nickname


at
first
ye
toffee
house
was
very
popular
with
fans

became
close
to
old

toffee
shop

they
sold
sweets
called
mints

ye
toffee
house
got
a
licence
to
throw
free
toffees
to
the
crowd
inside
the
ground
before
the
match


this
tradition
continues
even
today


a
teenage
girl
is
chosen
from
the
crowd
to
throw
toffees
to
the
crowd
before
the
match
at
half
time
and
after
the
match


at
other

history
early
years
the
club
was
formed
in
by
players
from
derbyshire
county
cricket
club
who
wanted
something
to
do
in
the
winter


they
started
out
by
playing
at
the
racecourse
ground
derby


the
rams
as
derby
county
are
known
were
one
of
the
first
members
of
the
football
league
when
it
started
in


back
in
the
club
moved
to
a
new
stadium
the
baseball
ground


it
was
called
this
because
baseball
had
been
played
there
much
earlier
beforehand
and
it
became
their
home
for
the
next
years


when
they
moved
derby
county
had
changed
their
club
colors
to
the
black
and
white
they
still
use
today
at
matches


in
derby
got
to
their
first
fa
cup
final
but
lost


the
same
happened
again
in
and


derby
went
down
to
the
football
league
second
division
for
the
first
time
in
but
they
came
back
up
to
the
<collocation>first division</collocation>
in


in
they
were
relegated
again
but
won
the
second
division
the
next
year
to
get
promoted


<collocation>world war</collocation>
i
meant
that
they
had
to
wait
until
to
play
<collocation>first division</collocation>
football
again


after
just
two
seasons
they
were
relegated
yet
again
in


after
derby
next
promotion
in
the
club
got
much
better
and
were
one
of
the
top
teams
from
the
late
all
the
way
through
to
the
season
which
was
interrupted
when
<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii
broke
out


fa
cup
win
the
fa
cup
restarted
in
the
season


derby
got
to
the
final
again
but
this
time
they
beat
athletic
to
win
the
cup


some
people
had
thought
the
reason
derby
kept
losing
in
the
fa
cup
was
that
they
were
cursed
by
gypsies
as
the
baseball
ground
was
built
on
the
site
of
a
<collocation>gypsy camp</collocation>


some
players
even
thought
so
and
before
the
final
they
asked
the
gypsies
to
lift
the
curse


the
football
league
began
again
the
next
season
but
derby
did
not
play
well
and
were
relegated
in


things
went
from
bad
to
worse
and
in
they
were
relegated
to
the
football
league
third
division
north
for
the
first
time
in
their
history


derby
were
too
good
for
that
league
though
and
finished
second
at
the
first
try


then
they
did
even
better
next
season
by
finishing
first
and
going
back
up
to
the
top
division


the
clough
years
in
<collocation>brian clough</collocation>
took
over
derby
county
with
peter
helping
him


derby
were
back
in
division
two
but
clough
got
them
promoted
to
the
<collocation>first division</collocation>
in


he
led
them
to
their
first
ever
championship
in


derby
could
not
win
the
title
again
the
next
season
but
they
did
get
to
the
of
the
european
cup
but
they
lost
to


a
lot
of
people
in
england
thought
after
the
match
that
the
italian
club
had
paid
money
to
the
referee
as
a
bribe


this
was
never
proved


clough
left
the
club
after
an
argument
with
derby
chairman
sam


clough
later
became
manager
of
forest
where
he
went
on
to
win
a
<collocation>first division</collocation>
championship
and
two
european
cups


after
clough
derby
won
the
league
again
in
this
time
with
dave
as
manager


he
used
to
play
for
the
club
as
captain
under
clough


when
left
in
derby
got
slowly
worse
until
they
went
down
in


derby
stay
in
the
second
division
was
not
a
happy
one
and
they
were
relegated
to
the
football
league
third
division
in


it
was
exactly
years
since
the
club
formed

just
nine
years
after

and
went
on
to
finish
