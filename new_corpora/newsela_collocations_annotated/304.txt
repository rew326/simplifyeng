a
battery
is
a
device
that
can
create
electricity
using
a
chemical
reaction


it
converts
energy
stored
in
molecules
inside
the
battery
into
electricity


they
produce
direct
current
dc
electricity
electricity
that
flows
in
one
direction
and
does
not
switch
back
and
forth


using
the
electricity
from
an
outlet
in
a
house
or
building
is
cheaper
and
uses
less
energy
but
a
battery
can
provide
electricity
in
areas
that
do
not
have
electric
power
distribution


it
is
also
useful
for
things
that
moved
around
and
cords
would
get
in
the
way

what
is
inside
a
battery
the
chemistry
it
can
be
one
cell
or
a
group
of
cells


each
cell
has
an
anode
cathode
and
electrolyte


the
electrolyte
is
the
main
material
inside
the
battery


it
is
often
a
type
of
acid
and
can
be
dangerous
to
touch


the
anode
reacts
with
the
electrolyte
to
produce
electrons
this
is
the
negative
or
end


the
cathode
reacts
with
the
electrolyte
and
wants
electrons
this
is
the
positive
or
end


an
electric
current
happens
when
a
wire
connects
the
anode
to
the
cathode
and
the
electrons
move
from
one
end
to
the
other


but
a
battery
can
be
damaged
by
just
a
wire
connecting
the
two
ends
so
a
load
is
also
needed
between
the
two
ends


the
load
is
something
that
slows
the
electrons
down
and
usually
does
something
useful
like
a
in
a
flashlight
or
the
electronics
in
a
calculator


batteries
connected
in
parallel
shown
in
a
schematic
and
a
drawing
the
electrolyte
can
be
liquid
or
solid


a
battery
is
called
a
wet
cell
or
dry
cell
battery
depending
on
the
type
of
electrolyte


the
chemical
reactions
that
occur
in
a
battery
are
<collocation>exothermic reactions</collocation>


this
type
of
reaction
makes
heat


for
example
if
you
leave
your
laptop
on
for
a
long
time
and
then
touch
the
battery
it
will
be
warm
or
hot


batteries
are
recharged
by
reversing
the
chemical
reaction
that
occurs
within
the
battery


but
a
battery
can
only
be
recharged
a
given
amount
of
time
recharge
life


even
with
built
in
batteries
can
not
be
recharged
forever


moreover
each
time
a
battery
is
recharged
its
ability
to
hold
a
charge
goes
down
a
bit


batteries
should
not
be
charged
as
various
harmful
and
<collocation>corrosive substances</collocation>
can
leak
out
such
as
<collocation>potassium hydroxide</collocation>


the
cells
can
be
connected
to
make
a
bigger
battery


connecting
the
positive
of
one
cell
to
the
negative
of
the
next
cell
is
called
connecting
them
in
series


the
voltage
of
each
battery
are
added
together


two
six
<collocation>volt batteries</collocation>
connected
in
series
will
make
volts


connecting
the
positive
of
one
cell
to
the
positive
of
the
other
and
the
negative
to
the
negative
is
called
connecting
them
in
parallel


the
<collocation>voltage stays</collocation>
the
same
but
the
current
is
added
together


voltage
is
the
pressure
pushing
the
electrons
through
the
wires
it
is
measured
in
volts


current
is
how
many
electrons
can
go
at
once
it
is
measured
in
amps


the
combination
of
current
and
voltage
is
the
power
watts
volts
<collocation>x amps</collocation>
of
the
battery


<collocation>battery sizes</collocation>
batteries
come
in
many
different
shapes
sizes
and
voltages


aa
aaa
c
and
d
cells
including
<collocation>alkaline batteries</collocation>
have
about
volts


the
voltage
of
a
cell
depends
on
the
chemicals
used


the
electric
charge
it
can
supply
depends
on
how
large
the
cell
is
as
well
as
what
chemicals


the
charge
a
battery
delivers
is
usually
measured
in


since
the
<collocation>voltage stays</collocation>
the
same
more
charge
means
a
bigger
cell
can
supply
more
amps
or
run
for
a
longer
time


history
the
very
first
batteries
were
invented
in
the
middle
east
around


then
they
were
buried
and
forgotten
about


fact
date
february
the
first
battery
was
invented
in
by
volta


nowadays
his
battery
is
called
the
voltaic
pile


later
batteries
were
bottles
with
a
fluid
and
some
metal
rods
in
them


people
had
to
be
careful
not
to
turn
these
batteries
so
the
fluid
would
spill


in
many
modern
batteries
the
fluid
is
soaked
up
in
a
kind
of
paste


and
everything
is
put
in
a
completely
sealed
case


because
of
this
case
nothing
can
spill
out
of
the
battery


an
exception
is
car
batteries
they
still
have
liquid

cells
and

are
not
batteries
because
they
do
not

the
energy
inside

a
capacitor
is
not
a
battery
because
it
does
not

the
energy
in
a
chemical

a
capacitor
can
store
electricity
and
create
electricity
much
faster
than
a
battery
but
it
usually
costs
too
much
to
make
it
as
big
as
a

can
be


scientists
and

are
working
to

better

possible
to

a

once
all

the

has
to

a
special
chemical
treatment


this
is
called
developing

through
that

the

become
visible
you

different

exist


some
require

if
it

accidentally
used
again
this
results
in
an
artifact
called
a
multiple

when
not
in
use
the
film
needs
to
be
covered
from
light
otherwise
it
will
record
any
lights
that
shine
on
it


this
will
make
it
useless
to
record
a

later
on


film
comes
in
a
can
called

amount
of
light
to
make
a

if
the
picture
is
too
bright

too
dark
it
will
not

the
longer
that
the

keeps
recording
the
more

it
will
get


if

being
photographed
is

it
will
be
recorded
faster


if

films
that

are
known
as

advantage
is
that
it
bonds
together
bricks
and
stones
better
than
any
other
method
known
to
mankind


concrete
is
strong
in
compression
but
weak
in
tension


for
some
purposes
it
needs
to
be
reinforced
with
steel
rods


these
rods
can
be
galvanised
to
prevent
rusting
and
corrosion


reinforced
concrete
buildings
can
be
made
to
link
all
the
parts
together
the
foundations
walls
floors
and
roofs
but
concrete
construction
does
not
make
buildings


concrete
is
as
old
as


it
was
not
invented
by
romans
but
much
used
by
them


some
kinds
of
concrete
are
waterproof
and
some
kinds
even
set
underwater


additives
there
are
many
additives
to
make
concrete
better
set
faster
set
slower
make
stronger
reduce
corrosion
and
so
on


the
romans
discovered
that
adding
<collocation>volcanic ash</collocation>
produced
a
concrete
which
would
set
under
water


the
romans
also
knew
that
adding
horse
hair
made
concrete
less
liable
to
crack
as
it
set
and
that
adding
blood
made
it
more


modern
concrete
was
made
in
by
british
engineer
john


he
added
pebbles
and
<collocation>powdered brick</collocation>
to
the
cement


in
english
inventor
joseph
invented
portland
cement
which
has
remained
the
main
cement
used
in
concrete
production


he
burnt
limestone
and
clay
together


the
burning
process
changed
the
chemical
properties
of
the
materials
and
created
a
stronger
cement
than
plain
crushed
limestone
alone
could
produce


the
century
saw
the
invention
of
reinforced
concrete
by
french
gardener
joseph
in
patented
in


with
improvements
by


this
is
concrete
with
steel
bars
in
it
called
reinforcing
bars


glass
fiber
or
plastic
fiber
is
beginning
to
replace
steel
bars


many
modern
chemicals
can
be
added
to
the
mixture
to
achieve
special
objectives


are
chemicals
which
improve
workability
which
means
the
ability
to
shape
the
concrete
before
it
has
set


pigments
can
change
the
dull
gray
color


corrosion
inhibitors
can
reduce
rusting
on
the
steel
bars


<collocation>air entrainment</collocation>
is
blowing
little
bubbles
in
the
concrete
before
it
sets


this
helps
the
concrete
survive
the
freezing
and
thawing
of
a
cold
climate


blast
furnace
slag
can
be
mixed
with
concrete


it
turns
the
color
into
almost
pure
white
and
makes
the
concrete
stronger
