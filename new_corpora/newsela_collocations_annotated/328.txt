global
warming
is
a
slow
steady
rise
in
earth
surface
temperature


temperatures
today
are
c
f
higher
than
<collocation>years ago</collocation>


the
basic
cause
seems
to
be
a
rise
in
atmospheric
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
as
predicted
by
a
<collocation>hundred years</collocation>
ago


when
people
use
<collocation>fossil fuels</collocation>
like
coal
and
oil
this
adds
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
to
the
air


when
people
cut
down
the
earth
forests
deforestation
this
means
less
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
is
taken
out
of
the
atmosphere
by
plants


if
the
earth
temperature
becomes
hotter
the
sea
level
will
also
become
higher


this
is
partly
because
water
expands
when
it
gets
warmer


it
is
also
partly
because
warm
temperatures
make
glaciers
melt


the
sea
level
rise
may
cause
coastal
areas
to
flood


weather
patterns
including
where
and
how
much
rain
or
snow
there
is
will
change


deserts
will
probably
increase
in
size


<collocation>colder areas</collocation>
will
warm
up
faster
than
warm
areas


strong
storms
may
become
more
likely
and
farming
may
not
make
as
much
food


these
effects
will
not
be
the
same
everywhere


the
changes
from
one
area
to
another
are
not
well
known


people
in
government
and
panel
on
<collocation>climate change</collocation>
have
talked
about
global
warming


they
do
not
agree
on
what
to
do
about
it


some
things
that
could
reduce
warming
are
to
burn
less
<collocation>fossil fuels</collocation>
adapt
to
any
temperature
changes
or
try
to
change
the
earth
to
reduce
warming


the
<collocation>kyoto protocol</collocation>
tries
to
reduce
pollution
from
the
burning
of

have

to
it

has

many
times
over
the

of
the

including
the
coming

ages


for
more

we
have
more
details


since
the
people
have
recorded
the

by

were

that

could

from
to
today
the
average
temperature
for
the
world
has
increased
by
about
starting

started
measuring
the
temperature
of
the
earth


before
there
were
not
enough
temperature
measurements
for

to
know

warm

cold
it
was


use
<collocation>proxy measurements</collocation>
to
try
to
figure
out
past
temperatures
before
there
were
thermometers


this
means
measuring
things
that
change
when
it
gets
colder
or
warmer


one
way
is
to
cut
into
a
tree
and
measure
how
far

the
growth

are


trees
that
live
a
long
time
can
give
us
an
idea
of
how
temperature
and
rain
changed
while
it
was
alive


for
most
of
the
past
years
the
temperature
did
change
much


there
were
some
times
where
the
temperatures
were
a
little
warmer

was

the

about
of
the

is
called

the
change
is
so
small
that
scientists
can
barely
measure
how
it
affects
the
temperature
of
the
earth


if
the
sun
was
causing
the
earth
to
warm
up
it
would
warm
both
the
surface
and
high
up
in
the
air


but
the
air
in
the
<collocation>upper stratosphere</collocation>
is
actually
getting
colder
so
scientists
do
think
changes
in
the
sun
have
much
effect

and
dirt
in

as

people
also
add
to

some
of

dirt
falls
out
within

some
is

so
small
that
it
could
stay
in

for

some
responses

people
try

by

have
tried

have
been

people
can
also
use
energy
sources
that
do
burn

or
can
prevent
the
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
from
getting
out


people
can
also
change
how
they
live
because
of
any
changes
that
global

will
bring


for
example
they
can
go
to
places
where
the

is
better
or
build
walls
around
cities
to
keep
flood
water
out


like
the

these

cost

will

etymology
the
term
global
warming
was
first
used
in
its
modern
sense
on
august
in
a
science
paper
by
wally
in
the
journal
science
called
are
we
on
the
brink
of
a
pronounced
global
warming


choice
of
words
was
new
and
represented
a
significant
recognition
that
the
climate
was
warming
previously
the
phrasing
used
by
scientists
was
inadvertent
climate
modification
because
while
it
was
recognized
humans
could
change
the
climate
no
one
was
sure
which
direction
it
was
going


the
national
academy
of
sciences
first
used
global
warming
in
a
paper
called
the
report
it
said
if
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
continues
to
increase
we
find
no
reason
to
doubt
that
climate
changes
will
result
and
no
reason
to
believe
that
these
changes
will
be
negligible


the
report
made
a
distinction
between
referring
to
surface
temperature
changes
as
global
warming
while
referring
to
other
changes
caused
by
increased
co
as
<collocation>climate change</collocation>


global
warming
became
more
widely
popular
after
when
nasa
climate
scientist
james
used
the
term
in
a
testimony
to
congress


he
said
global
warming
has
reached
a
level
such
that
we
can
ascribe
with
a
high
degree
of
confidence
a
cause
and
effect
relationship
between
the
<collocation>greenhouse effect</collocation>
and
the
observed
warming


his
testimony
was
widely
reported
and
afterward
global
warming
was
commonly
used
by
the
press
and
in
<collocation>public discourse</collocation>

in
chemistry
an
alkali
is
an
aqueous
from
water
solution
with
a
ph
value
of
more
than
seven


the
word
alkali
comes
from
the
arabic
meaning
from
the
ashes
since
ashes
mixed
with
water
used
as
cleaning
products
such
as
soaps
are
made
of
alkali
materials
an
alkali
is
where
a
base
is
dissolved
in
water


often
it
is
the
salt
of
an
alkali
metal
an
alkali
is
the
opposite
to
an
acid
and
can
be
neutralised
brought
down
to
ph
by

acid
