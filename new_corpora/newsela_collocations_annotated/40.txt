capacity

children

a

period
from
about
months

may

summary
living
organisms
are
open
systems


they
are
always
changing
because
they
exchange
materials
and
information
with
their
environment


they
undergo
metabolism
maintain
homeostasis
possess
a
capacity
to
grow
respond
to
stimuli
and
reproduce


through
natural
selection
they
adapt
to
their
environment
in
<collocation>successive generations</collocation>


more
complex
living
organisms
can
communicate
through
various
means


many
life
forms
can
be
found
on
earth


the
properties
common
to
these
organisms
plants
animals
fungi
and
bacteria
are
a
carbon
and
cellular
form
with
complex
organization
and
genetic
information


at
present
the
earth
is
the
only
planet
we
have
detailed
information
about


the
question
of
whether
life
exists
elsewhere
in
the
universe
is
open


there
have
been
a
number
of
claims
of
life
elsewhere
in
the
universe


none
of
these
have
been
confirmed
so
far


the
best
evidence
of
life
outside
of
earth
is
fossil
evidence
of
possible
bacterial
life
on
mars


definitions
of
life
one
explanation
of
life
is
called
the
cell
theory


the
cell
theory
has
three
basic
points
all
living
things
are
made
up
of
cells


the
cell
is
the
smallest
living
thing
that
can
do
all
the
things
needed
for
life


all
cells
must
come
from
cells


something
is
often
said
to
be
alive
if
it
grows
takes
in
food
uses
the
food
for
energy
and
passes
waste
products
see
metabolism
moves
meaning
it
must
either
move
itself
or
have
movement
inside
of
itself
reproduces
either
sexually
with
another
living
thing
or
by
creating
copies
of
itself
and
reacts
to
its
surroundings
however
not
all
living
things
fit
every
point
on
this
list


mules
can
not
reproduce
and
neither
can
worker
ants
viruses
and
spores
are
not
actively
alive
until
the
conditions
are
right


they
do
however
fit
the
<collocation>biochemical definitions</collocation>
they
are
made
of
the
same
kind
of
chemicals


the
<collocation>thermodynamic definition</collocation>
of
life
is
any
system
which
can
keep
its
entropy
levels
below
maximum
usually
through
adaptation
and
mutations
