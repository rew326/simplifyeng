tapeworms
are
the
class
of
segmented
flatworms


they
are
parasitic
which
means
that
they
need
another
larger
creature
as
a
host


tapeworms
live
inside
the
intestines
of
vertebrate
animals


this
includes
humans


when
a
vertebrate
has
a
tapeworm
they
may
lose
weight
and
become
weaker


tapeworms
can
be
up
to
or
feet
metres
long


they
eat
by
absorbing
material
directly
through
their
epidermis
outside
layer


the
head
of
a
tapeworm
has
four
suckers
and
two
rings
of
hooks


the
body
of
a
tapeworm
is
in
segments
pieces
that
are
like
each
other


each
segment
can
produce
eggs


little
segments
of
the
tapeworm
sometimes
break
off
and
pass
out
through
the
stool
of
the
host
with
the
eggs


little
segments
of
its
body
fall
off


they
go
out
of
the
host
body
and
are
eaten
by
the
next
host
which
is
another
type
of
vertebrate


tapeworms
are
hermaphrodite
with
both
sexes


cross
fertilization
occurs
between
two
tapeworms
in
the
same
intestine


they
have
a
life
cycle
with
a
secondary
or
intermediate
host


for
example
human
tapeworms
have
cows
or
pigs
as
<collocation>intermediate hosts</collocation>


the
definitive
host
humans
in
this
case
is
the
one
where
fertilization
takes
place


tapeworms
do
have
a
gut
so
they
have
to
absorb
nutrients
directly
across
their
skin

herbivores
are
animals
that

they

humans
are
because
they
eat
meat
as
well
as
vegetable
matter


people
who
eat
mostly
plants
are
usually
called
vegetarians


herbivores
such
as
deer
elephants
horses
have
teeth
that
are
adapted
to
grind
vegetable
tissue


many
animals
that
eat
fruit
and
leaves
sometimes
eat
other
parts
of
plants
for
example
roots
and
seeds


usually
such
animals
can
not
chew
or
digest
meat


but
some
<collocation>herbivorous animals</collocation>
will
eat
eggs
and
occasionally
other
animal
protein


some
herbivores
can
be
classified
as
because
they
eat
mainly
fruit
or
browsers
which
eat
mostly
leaves


animals
that
eat
mostly
grass
are
grazing
animals


the
diets
of
some
<collocation>herbivorous animals</collocation>
change
with
the
seasons


in
the
temperate
zones
of
the
earth
some
seasons
are
hot
and
some
are
cold
so
different
plants
are
available
at
different
times
of
the
year

this
is
an
example

interactions
according
to
the
theory
of
predator
prey
interactions
the
relationship
between
herbivores
and
plants
is
cyclic


when
prey
plants
are
numerous
their
predators
herbivores
increase
in
numbers
reducing
the
plant
population
which
in
turn
causes
herbivore
number
to
decline


the
prey
population
eventually
recovers
starting
a
new
cycle


this
suggests
that
the
population
of
the
herbivore
fluctuates
around
the
carrying
capacity
of
the
food
source
in
this
case
the
plant


there
will
always
be
pockets
of
plants
not
found
by
herbivores


this
is
important
for
specialist
herbivores
which
feed
on
only
one
species
of
plant
it
prevents
these
specialists
from
wiping
out
their
food
source


eating
a
second
plant
type
helps
herbivores
populations
stabilize


alternating
between
two
or
more
plant
types
provides
population
stability
for
the
herbivore
while
the
populations
of
the
plants
oscillate


when
an
invasive
herbivore
or
plant
enters
the
system
the
balance
is
thrown
off
and
the
diversity
can
change
or
even
collapse


in
some
ways
it
is
easier
to
be
an
herbivorous
animal
than
a
carnivorous
animal


<collocation>carnivorous animals</collocation>
have
to
find
and
catch
the
animals
that
they
eat
and
sometimes
the
animals
that
they
want
to
eat
fight
them


<collocation>herbivorous animals</collocation>
have
to
find
the
plants
that
they
want
to
eat
but
they
do
not
have
to
catch
them


many
plants
have
some
defense
against
herbivores
such
as
spines
toxins
poisons
or
a
bad
taste


there
are
many
more
<collocation>herbivorous animals</collocation>
living

early
years
beethoven
in


very
little
is
known
about
beethoven
childhood


he
was
baptized
on
december
and
was
probably
born
a
few
days
before
that


father
had
been
chef
at
the
court
of
the
of
trier
at
fortress
opposite
to


his
father
was
a
fairly
unimportant
musician
who
worked
at
the
court
of
the
of
cologne


this
court
was
in
and
it
was
here
that
he
lived
until
he
was
a
young
man


his
father
gave
him
his
first
lessons
in
piano
and
violin


beethoven
was
a
<collocation>child prodigy</collocation>
like
mozart
but
while
mozart
as
a
little
boy
was
taken
all
over
europe
by
his
father
beethoven
never
traveled
until
he
was


by
that
time
his
<collocation>piano teacher</collocation>
was
a
man
called
who
had
learned
the
piano
from
carl
bach
the
son
of
bach


said
to
the
that
the
young
beethoven
should
be
given
the
chance
to
travel
so
he
was
allowed
to
go
to
vienna


there
he
seemed
to
have
had
one
or
two
lessons
from
mozart
but
then
beethoven
got
a
letter
saying
that
his
mother
was
dying
so
he
hurried
back
to


soon
his
mother
died
and
beethoven
had
to
help
to
look
after
the
family
because
his
father
had
become
an
alcoholic


beethoven
played
the
viola
in
the
orchestra
of
the
he
started
to
compose
and
made
many
friends


some
of
these
friends
were
musicians
and
others
were
very
important
people
many
of
them
were
aristocrats
who
would
be
able
to
help
him
in
his
career


in
the
let
beethoven
travel
to
vienna
again


they
expected
him
to
return
after
a
while


however
beethoven
never
left
vienna


he
stayed
there
for
the
rest
of
his
life


he
would
have
loved
to
have
had
some
more
composition
lessons
from
mozart
but
mozart
had
just
died
so
he
had
lessons
from
haydn
instead


haydn
was
a
good
teacher
but
a
year
later
he
went
off
to
england


therefore
beethoven
took
lessons
from
a
man
called
who
was
not
famous
like
haydn


he
was
a
good
teacher
too
and
he
made
him
write
lots
of
<collocation>technical exercises</collocation>


he
showed
him
how
to
write
advanced
counterpoint
and


this
helped
him
to
be
a
great
composer


beethoven
wanted
to
become
famous
as
a
pianist
and
composer
so
he
started
to
get
to
know
important
aristocratic
people


some
of
these
people
had
already
heard
him
in
when
they
had
traveled
there
so
his
name
was
becoming
known
in
vienna


it
also
helped
that
he
could
say
he
was
the
pupil
of
the
famous
joseph
haydn


there
were
a
lot
of
aristocratic
people
in
vienna
who
liked
music
and
many
had
their
own
private
orchestras


some
of
them
started
to
give
beethoven
places
to
live
when
the
of
stopped
sending
him
money
in


beethoven
started
to
perform
in
private
houses
and
he
became
known
for
his


in
he
performed
one
of
his
<collocation>piano concertos</collocation>
at
a
concert


he
also
had
his
first
publication
his
opus


this
was
a
group
of
three
piano
trios


haydn
had
heard
them
at
a
private
concert
a
year
before
and
had
advised
beethoven
not
to
publish
the
third
one


however
he
did
publish
it
and
that
was
the
one
which
became
the
most
successful


his
opus
was
a
group
of
three
<collocation>piano sonatas</collocation>
which
he
played
at
the
court
of
his
friend
prince


when
he
published
them
he
dedicated
them
to
haydn


beethoven
was
starting
to
become
famous
traveling
to
places
like
prague
and


he
wrote
much
chamber
music


he
was
perhaps
a
little
jealous
of
the
success
that
haydn
had
with
his
<collocation>latest symphonies</collocation>
he
had
written
for
london


in
he
gave
his
first
public
concert
with
his
own
music


he
conducted
his
first
symphony
as
well
as
the
septet


by
now
several
publishers
were
trying
to
persuade
him
to
let
them
publish
his
new
works


beethoven
was
becoming
famous
as
a
composer


and
during
this
period
beethoven
produced
his
most
famous
<collocation>piano sonata</collocation>
in
c
sharp
minor
nicknamed
moonlight


this
was
written
for
his
girlfriend


however
he
was
far
from
happy
because
he
realized
that
he
was
starting
to
become
deaf


and
when
he
asked
for
marriage
her
parents
refused
and
married
her
to
another
man
instead


middle
period
beethoven
seems
to
have
tried
to
forget
these
bad
thoughts
by
working
very
hard


he
composed
a
lot
more
music
including
his
third
symphony
called
the


originally
he
gave
it
the
title
in
honor
of
napoleon
whom
he
admired


but
when
napoleon
crowned
himself
emperor
in
beethoven
began
to
think
that
he
was
just
a
tyrant
who
wanted
a
lot
of
power
