inertia
is
the
resistance
of
an
object
to
any
change
in
its
motion
including
a
change
in
direction


an
object
will
stay
still
or
keep
moving
at
the
same
speed
and
in
a
straight
line
unless
it
is
acted
upon
by
an
outside
force


for
example
a
<collocation>rubber ball</collocation>
will
not
start
bouncing
around
unless
someone
picks
it
up
and
throws
it


basically
if
an
object
is
not
moving
it
wo
start
moving
unless
something
else
acts
upon
it


the
same
idea
can
be
applied
to
motion
an
object
in
motion
will
stay
in
motion
unless
some
outside
opposing
force
acts
upon
it


inertia
is
also
called
sir
<collocation>isaac newton</collocation>
first
law
of
motion


the
first
law
of
motion
says
that
every
body
perseveres
in
its
state
of
being
at
rest
or
of
moving
uniformly
straight
ahead
except
insofar
as
it
is
compelled
to
change
its
state
by
forces
impressed


cohen

this
basically
means
every
