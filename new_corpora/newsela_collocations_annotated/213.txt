some
large
cities
like
<collocation>new york</collocation>
city
and
london
have
more
than
one
airport


two
large
makers
of
aircraft
are
and
boeing


advances
in
technology
have
made
aircraft
more
efficient
in
recent
years


things
like
and
more
efficient
have
helped
to
do
this


parts
most
aircraft
have
certain
parts
in
common


wings
the
wings
are
the
most
important
part
because
they
are
what
makes
the
plane
fly


the
wings
create
a
force
called
lift
that
goes
against
gravity
which
makes
the
plane
get
off
the
ground


when
air
flows
around
the
wing
which
happens
when
the
plane
moves
forward
the
wing
pushes
air
down
which
in
turn
pushes
the
plane
up


lift
can
also
be
explained
using
principle
since
wings
are
designed
so
that
air
goes
faster
on
the
top
of
the
wing
than
on
the
bottom
the
higher
pressure
on
the
bottom
will
push
the
plane
up


some
wings
have
panels
on
the
back
called
flaps


flaps
can
be
extended
to
make
the
wing
bigger


this
makes
the
wing
make
more
lift
but
also
more
drag


this
lets
the
plane
fly
slower
without
stalling
so
flaps
are
often
used
during
takeoff
and
landing


tail
the
tail
also
called
the
vertical
stabilizer
is
a
large
flat
panel
normally
at
the
back
of
the
plane


this
helps
the
plane
fly
straight


some
planes
have
more
than
one
tail
like
the


some
planes
also
have
no
tail
like
the
flying
wing
design


engines
<collocation>engines push</collocation>
the
plane
forward


this
makes
sure
that
air
goes
over
the
wings
which
makes
the
plane
fly


some
aircraft
such
as
gliders
do
have
engines


instead
they
use
gravity
to
give
them
forward
speed


fuselage
the
fuselage
is
the
part
of
the
plane
that
people
go
inside


it
is
normally
shaped
like
a
cylinder


it
might
have
windows
or
doors


<collocation>landing gear</collocation>
the
<collocation>landing gear</collocation>
is
what
supports
the
plane
on
the
ground


it
can
be
wheels
if
the
plane
lands
on
the
ground
or
skids
if
the
plane
lands
in
the
water


many
planes
can
retract
bring
inside
the
fuselage
their
<collocation>landing gear</collocation>
to
make
less
drag

some
aircraft
are

by
air
forces
to
defend
countries


these
aircraft
may
use
guns
or
missiles
for
combat
with
other
aircraft
or
they
may
drop
bombs
on

targets


aircraft
allow
people
to

longer
distances
and
faster
than
ships
or
trains


aircraft
can
fly
from
<collocation>new york</collocation>
to
london
in
about
hours


it
would
take
one
week
or
more
on
a

airplanes
are
also
used
by
the
military
to
see
many
things
on
the
ground
easily


this
is
called
surveillance
or
reconnaissance


often
aircraft
will
take
photographs
as
well
which
can
be
used
for
military
planning
later


transportation
aircraft
have
long
been
used
for
moving
people
from
place
to
place
for
things
like
holidays


problems
sometimes
people
are
scared
to
fly


they
may
think
that
the
plane
could
crash
or
be
hijacked
by
terrorists


however
statistics
show
that
riding
in
a
plane
is
safer
than
driving
in
a
car


the
september
attacks
helped
spread
this
fear
of
