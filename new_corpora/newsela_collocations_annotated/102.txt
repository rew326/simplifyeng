earth
moon
a
natural
satellite
in
astronomy
is
a
smaller
body
which
moves
around
a
larger
body


the
smaller
body
is
held
in
orbit
by
gravitation


the
term
is
used
for
moons
which
go
around
planets
and
it
is
also
used
for
small
galaxies
which
orbit
larger
galaxies


bodies
which
orbit
planets
are
called
moons


they
vary
in
size
and
are


the
earth
has
only
one
moon


some
other
planets
have
many
moons
and
some
have
none


when
people
write
just
the
moon
they
are
usually
talking
about
the
moon
of
the
earth


earth
moon
is
written
with
a
capital
letter
moon


the
latin
word
for
the
moon
is
luna
which
is
why
the
adjective
used
to
talk
about
the
moon
is
lunar


for
example
lunar
eclipse


anything
that
goes
around
a
planet
is
called
a
satellite


moons
are
natural
satellites


people
also
use
rockets
to
send
machines
into
orbit
around
the
earth


these
machines
are
called
artificial
satellites


they
help
us
to
communicate
the
telephones

moons
do

we
can
see
the
earth
moon
because
it
acts
like
a
mirror
and
reflects
the
light
of
the
sun


the
same
half
of
the
moon
faces
toward
earth
at
all
times
no
matter
where
it
moves


but
different
parts
of
the
moon
are
lit
up
by
the
sun
so
it
looks
different
at
different
times
of
the
month


this
change
as
seen
from
earth
is
called
the
phases
of
the
moon
or
lunar
phases


a
moon
cycle
is
the
time
the
moon
takes
to
change
from
looking
very
bright
and
round
to
looking
very
small
and
thin
and
then
back
to
bright
and
round
again


in
the
case
of
the
earth
moon
this
is
about
four
weeks


it
does
this
about
times
in
one
year


the
moon
cycle
is
about
days
a
bit
shorter

orbits
the
orbit
of
a
moon
or
other
satellite
is
affected
by
two
forces
gravity
and
the
<collocation>centripetal force</collocation>


for
example
the
earth
moon
is
kept
in
orbit
by
the
gravitational
pull
from
the
earth


this
is
also
the
way
the
earth
is
attracted
to
the
sun
and
stays
in
its
orbit


the
orbit
of
the
earth
moon
actually
causes
the
tides
and
waves
on

they
are

it

everyday
gravity
weight
vs
mass
in
everyday
talk
we
say
things
fall
because
the
earth
<collocation>gravity pulls</collocation>
on
them


we
talk
as
if
our
weight
was
a
given


actually
weight
changes
when
the
pull
of
gravity
changes


the
moon
is
much
smaller
and
the
pull
of
gravity
on
the
moon
is
about
that
of
earth


so
any
object
on
the
moon
weighs
of
its
weight
on
earth


what
does
not
change
is
the
amount
of
matter
in
an
object


that
is
called
its
mass


on
earth
mass
and
weight
are
the
same
for
<collocation>practical purposes</collocation>


the
trip
to
the
moon
shows
they
are
not
really
the
same


from
this
we
learn
two
things


the
weight
of
an
object
is
variable
its
mass
is
constant


the
pull
of
gravity
varies
according
to
the
mass
of
an
object


the
earth
pulls
more
strongly
than
the
moon


a
person
also
exerts
a
gravitational
pull
but
it
is
so
tiny
it
is
ignored
for
all
<collocation>practical purposes</collocation>


the
earth
has
mass


every
particle
of
matter
has
mass


so
the
earth
pulls
on
every
object
and
person
and
they
pull
on
the
earth


<collocation>gravity pulls</collocation>
on
the
mass
and
gives
it
weight


gravity
vs
gravitation
these
words
mean
almost
the
same
thing
in
everyday
use


sometimes
scientists
use
gravity
for
the
force
that
pulls
objects
towards
each
other
and
gravitation
for
the
theory
about
the
attraction


history
of
gravitational
theory
newton
law
of
<collocation>universal gravitation</collocation>


galileo
in
the
late
century
galileo
did
a
famous
experiment
about
gravity
where
he
dropped
balls
from
the
tower
of
pisa


he
later
rolled
balls
down
inclines


with
these
experiments
galileo
showed
that
gravitation
accelerates
all
objects
at
the
same
rate
regardless
of
weight


the
man
who
really
worked
it
all
out
was
johannes
who
after
pages
of
calculations
and
many
false
starts
and
ideas
finally
got
these
three
laws
<collocation>elliptical orbit</collocation>
law
the
planets
orbit
the
sun
in
<collocation>elliptical orbits</collocation>
with
the
sun
at
one
focus


law
the
line
connecting
a
planet
to
the
sun
sweeps
out
equal
areas
in
equal
amounts
of
time


law
of
periods
the
time
required
for
a
planet
to
orbit
the
sun
called
its
period
is
proportional
to
the
long
axis
of
the
raised
to
the
power


the
constant
of
proportionality
is
the
same
for
all
the
planets


newton
in
english
mathematician
<collocation>isaac newton</collocation>
wrote
the
principia


in
this
book
he
wrote
about
the
law
of
gravitation


newton
said
that
the
closer
two
objects
are
to
each
other
the
more
gravity
will
affect
them


his
theory
about
gravitation
was
used
to
predict
the
existence
of
the
planet
neptune
based
on
changes
in
the
orbit
of
uranus


newton
theory
was
later
used
to
predict
the
existence
of
another
planet
closer
to
the
sun
than
mercury


when
this
was
done
it
was
learned
that
his
theory
was
not
entirely
correct


these
mistakes
in
his
theory
were
corrected
by
albert
einstein
theory
of
general
relativity


newton
theory
is
still
commonly
used
for
many
things
because
it
is
much
more
simple
to
work
with
than
the
theory
of
general
relativity
and
is
usually
accurate
enough
for
many
uses


dynamic
equilibrium
why
does
the
earth
not
fall
into
the
sun


the
answer
is
simple
but
very
important


it
is
because
the
earth
moving
round
the
sun
is
in
a
dynamic
equilibrium


the
speed
of
the
earth
movement
creates
a
centrifugal
force
which
balances
the
gravitational
force
between
the
sun
and
the
earth


why
does
the
earth
continue
spinning


because
there
is
no
force
to
stop
it


newton
first
law
if
a
body
is
at
rest
it
remains
at
rest
or
if
it
is
in
motion
it
moves
at
the
same
speed
until
it
is
acted
on
by
an
external
force


there
is
a
kind
of
analogy
between
centrifugal
force
and
gravitational
force
which
led
to
the
principle
of
general
relativity


weightlessness
a
situation
when
a
thing
<collocation>motion balances</collocation>
out
the
pull
of
gravity
on
it


general
relativity
the
special
theory
of
relativity
describes
systems
where
gravity
is
not
an
issue
by
contrast
gravity
is
the
central
issue
of
the
general
theory
of
relativity


in
general
relativity
there
is
no
gravitational
force
deflecting
objects
from
their
natural
straight
paths


instead
gravity
is
seen
as
changes
in
the
properties
of
space
and
time


in
turn
this
changes
the
paths
that
objects
will
naturally
follow


the
curvature
is
in
turn
caused
by
the
energy
momentum
of
matter


spacetime
tells
matter
how
to
move

converge
on

of

predicts
that
the
path
of
light
is
bent
in
a
gravitational
field
light
passing
a

is
deflected

this
effect
has
been
confirmed
by
observing
the
light
of
stars
or
distant

being
deflected
as
it
passes
the

closely
related
to
<collocation>light deflection</collocation>
is
the
gravitational

delay
or

the
phenomenon
that
light
signals
take
longer
to
move
through
a
gravitational

than
they
would
in
the
absence
of
that
field


there
have
been
numerous
successful
tests
of
this

<collocation>gravitational waves</collocation>
are

them
in

<collocation>gravitational waves</collocation>
can

although

has
not

there
is
indirect
evidence
for
its
existence


the

was
