of
a
traffic

badly
injured
her
she
had
periods
of
severe
pain
for
the
rest
of
her
life


after
this
accident
no
longer
continued
her
medical
studies
but
took
up
painting


she
used
ideas
about
things
that
had
happened
to
her


her
paintings
are
often
shocking
in
the
way
they
show
pain
and
the
harsh
lives
of
women
especially
her
feelings
about
not
being
able
to
have
children


of
her
paintings
are
of

although
she
organized

shows
several
times
with
european
surrealists
she
herself
did
not
like
that
label


fact
date
january
her
attention
to
female
themes
and
the
honesty
in
her
painting
them
made
her
something
of
a
feminist
cult
figure
in
the
last
decades

fear
and
loathing
in
las
vegas
a
<collocation>savage journey</collocation>
to
the
heart
of
the
american
dream
is
a
book
written
by
hunter
thompson


the
book
is
based
on
an
article
thompson
wrote
for
<collocation>rolling stone</collocation>
magazine


it
was
later
made
into
a
movie
directed
by
terry
and
starring
johnny
and
<collocation>del toro</collocation>


the
novel
fear
and
loathing
in
las
vegas
accounts
for
two
trips
to
las
vegas
nevada
that
hunter
thompson
and
attorney
oscar
zeta
took
in
march
and
april


the
first
trip
spawned
from
an
thompson
was
writing
for
<collocation>rolling stone</collocation>
magazine
about
the
television
journalist
whom
officers
of
the
angeles
<collocation>county sheriff</collocation>
office
had
shot
and
killed
with
a
tear
gas
grenade
fired
at
close
range
during
the
national
chicano
moratorium
march
against
the
vietnam
war
in


thompson
was
using
a
prominent
political
activist
and
attorney
as
a
central
source
for
the
story
and
the
two
found
it
difficult
for
a
mexican
to
talk
openly
with
a
white
reporter
in
the
racially
tense
atmosphere
of
angeles
california


the
two
needed
a
more
comfortable
place
to
discuss
the
story
and
decided
to
take
advantage
of
a
<collocation>sports illustrated</collocation>
magazine
offer
to
write
photograph
captions
for
the
<collocation>annual mint</collocation>
desert
race
being
held
in
las
vegas


the
thompson
and
personae
on
which
duke
and
gonzo
were
based


thompson
wrote
that
he
concluded
their
march
trip
by
spending
some
hours
alone
in
a
hotel
room
feverishly
writing
in
my
notebook
about
his
experiences


the
genesis
of
fear
and
loathing
in
las
vegas
a
<collocation>savage journey</collocation>
to
the
heart
of
the
american
dream
is
in
that
notebook


what
originally
was
a
for
<collocation>sports illustrated</collocation>
grew
to
a
feature
story
for
<collocation>rolling stone</collocation>


thompson
said
<collocation>publisher jann</collocation>
had
liked
the
first
or
so
jangled
pages
enough
to
take
it
seriously
on
its
own
terms
and
tentatively
scheduled
it
for
publication
which
gave
me
the
push
i
needed
to
keep
working
on
it


he
had
first
submitted
a
word
manuscript
to
<collocation>sports illustrated</collocation>
that
was
aggressively
rejected


weeks
later
thompson
and
returned
to
las
vegas
to
report
for
<collocation>rolling stone</collocation>
on
the
national
<collocation>district attorneys</collocation>
association
conference
on
narcotics
and
dangerous
drugs
being
held
from
the
to
april
and
to
add
material
to
the
larger
fear
and
loathing
narrative


besides
attending
the
attorneys
conference
thompson
and
looked
for
ways
in
vegas
to
explore
the
theme
of
the
american
dream
which
was
the
basis
for
the
novel
second
half
which
thompson
referred
at
the
time
as
vegas
ii


on
april
he
began
writing
the
full
manuscript
in
a
hotel
room
in
arcadia
california
in
his
spare
time
while
completing
strange
rumblings
in
the
article
chronicling
the
slain
