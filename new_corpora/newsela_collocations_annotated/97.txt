bank


it
lets
other

borrow
money


the
banks
then
let
people

companies
take
the
money
from

the

then
pay
money
at
a
rate
called
the

rate


this
number
is
set
by

federal
reserve
board
and
is
changed
however
money
is

the
paid
rate
is
called
the
overnight
lending
rate
because
money
is
borrowed
for
a
small
time

giving

what
astrophysicists
do
is
ask
whether
a
particular
model
of
the
universe
is
consistent
with
what
is
known
through
observations
and
measurements
of
the
universe


if
the
<collocation>observable universe</collocation>
is
smaller
than
the
entire
universe
in
some
models
it
is
many
orders
of
magnitude
smaller
or
even
infinitesimal
observation
is
limited
to
a
part
of
the
whole


consideration
of
the
shape
of
the
universe
can
be
split
into
two
local
geometry
which
relates
especially
to
the
curvature
of
the
universe
especially
in
the
<collocation>observable universe</collocation>
and
global
geometry
which
relates
to
the
of
the
universe
as
a
whole
measurement
of
which
may
not
be
possible


the
<collocation>observable universe</collocation>
is
the
basis
for
testing
any
model
of
the
universe


it
is
a
spherical
volume
a
ball
centered
on
the
observer
regardless
of
the
shape
of
the
universe
as
a
whole


every
location
in
the
universe
has
its
own
<collocation>observable universe</collocation>
which
may
or
may
not
overlap
with
the
one
centered
on
earth


recent
measurements
have
led
nasa
to
state
we
now
know
that
the
universe
is
flat
with
only
a
margin
of
error
