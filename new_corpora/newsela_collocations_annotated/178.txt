a
tax
form
tax
is
money
that
people
are
forced
to
pay
to
the
government


in
ancient
times
people
from
one
city
or
region
would
attack
people
from
another
place
and
make
them
pay
tribute


tribute
meant
that
the
conquered
people
would
pay
money
or
other
things
and
the
conqueror
would
stop
attacking
them


a
famous
tribute
was
the
when
people
from
denmark
conquered
part
of
england
and
made
the
english
pay
thousands
of
silver
coins


in
a
tax
the
government
makes
the
people
of
a
country
state
or
city
pay
money


this
money
goes
to
pay
people
who
work
for
the
government
and
to
pay
for
things
that
the
government
does
such
as
build
roads
and
bridges


types
of
taxes
there
are
many
different
kinds
of
taxes


some
taxes
are
based
on
how
much
money
a
person
earns


the
more
money
is
earned
the
more
a
person
must
pay


this
is
called
an
<collocation>income tax</collocation>


there
are
three
different
types
of
income
taxes
flat
<collocation>income tax</collocation>
everybody
pays
the
same
percentage
of
their
income


russia
has
a
flat
<collocation>income tax</collocation>
and
everybody
in
russia
has
to
pay
of
the
income


progressive
<collocation>income tax</collocation>
the
more
money
a
person
makes
the
higher
percentage
of
their
income
they
have
to
pay


the
united
states
and
several
european
countries
have
this
tax


an
example
of
this
tax
is
if
a
person
who
makes
per
year
pays
of
their
income
and
a
person
who
makes
per
year
pays
of
their
income


regressive
<collocation>income tax</collocation>
the
more
money
a
person
makes
the
lower
percentage
of
their
income
they
have
to
pay
the
opposite
of
the
progressive
<collocation>income tax</collocation>


this
tax
is
very
uncommon


other
taxes
are
based
on
how
much
a
person
buys


this
is
a
sales
tax
or
value
added
tax
vat


some
people
suggest
replacing
the
<collocation>income tax</collocation>
with
a
larger
sale
tax


that
idea
is
called
the
fair
tax


there
are
also
taxes
based
on
how
much
a
person
owns
called
property
tax


things
like
houses
have
a
property
tax
on
them


see
also
the
<collocation>stamp act</collocation>
which
led
to
a
tax
on
stamping
documents


in
the
united
states
for
example
the
national
government
has
an
<collocation>income tax</collocation>
most
states
have
an
<collocation>income tax</collocation>
or
a
sales
tax
or
both
and
cities
and
towns
may
have
a
sales
tax
or
a
property
tax


in
some
states
such
as
ohio
the
sales
tax
is
different
in
each
county


in
adam
smith
said
there
should
be
four
principles
about
taxes
the
tax
people
pay
should
be
related
to
their
capacity
and
the
amount
of
money
they
earn
it
should
be
clear
how
much
tax
a
person
had
to
pay
paying
taxes
should
be
done
in
a
way
that
that
is
comfortable
to
the
taxpayer
this
both
applies
to
the
way
in
which
taxes
are
paid
and
also
to
the
time
when
taxes
must
be
paid


collecting
taxes
should
be
as
cheap
as
possible
to
the
state
what
the
government
does
with
money
it
gets
from
taxes
the
government
uses
the
money
collected
from
taxes
to
pay
for
things


for
example
people
who
work
for
the
government
must
be
paid
so
some
taxes
are
used
to
pay
these
people


taxes
are
sometimes
also
used
in
ways
that
help
everybody
like
to
pay
for
education
health
care
and
to
keep
things
like
roads
bridges
sewers
and
certain
buildings
in
good
shape


people
who
oppose
taxes
libertarians
are
against
all
taxes
or
against
high
taxes


anarchists
are
opposed
to
all
taxes


anarchists
are
also
opposed
to
any
form
of
government


congressman
paul
is
against
high
taxes

a

the
<collocation>gulf stream</collocation>

of

used
to
be
covered
by
a
swamp
called
the

when
florida
was
first
being
settled
farmers
found
out
the
soil
there
was
very
good
for
growing
plants


so
they
could
use
more
of
the
land
to
plant
they
drained
a
lot
of
the
water
away
in


in
the
state
put
in
levees
and
canals
to
make
more
room
for
farming
and
