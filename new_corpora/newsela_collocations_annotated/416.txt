cabbage
kimchi
kimchi
is
a
traditional
korean
food
made
from
vegetables
widely
with
<collocation>chili pepper</collocation>


it
often
contains
things
like
chinese
cabbage
radish
garlic
red
pepper
<collocation>spring onion</collocation>
shrimp
ginger
salt
and
sugar


kimchi
is
usually
very
strong
for


there
are
many
different
types
and
koreans
typically
eat
kimchi
in
every
meal


it
is
a
staple
of
korean
food


kimchi
can
be
stored
for
a
long
time
and
it
does
not
go
bad
easily


however
when
it
is
exposed
to
hot
weather
for
certain
time
kimchi
<collocation>turns sour</collocation>


so
it
should
not
be
put
out
unless
it
is
going
to
be
eaten
soon


in
korea
<collocation>kimchi pots</collocation>
are
a
common
sight


they
are
large
terra
cotta
pots
where
the
kimchi
is
stored
until
it
can
be
eaten
or
until
it
ferments


a
<collocation>typical batch</collocation>
of
kimchi
takes
about
weeks
to
ferment
but
some
varieties
can
be
eaten
right
away


some
must
be
stored
for
over
a
year
to
be
finished


the
fermentation
gives
the
kimchi
a
pickle
like
quality
and
generally
soggy
or
limp
kimchi
is
not
good


preparation
the
most
common
variety
of
kimchi
is
made
from
cabbage
radish
garlic
red
pepper
salt
and
sugar


the
cabbage
is
soaked
in
salt
water
for
a
few
hours


<collocation>coarse rock</collocation>
salt
is
then
rubbed
in
between
the
leaves
of
the
cabbage


red
peppers
are
also
rubbed
in
and
most
kimchi
has
a
lot
of
pepper
in
it


the
radish
is
usually
cut
into
long
thin
strips
and
added
to
the
mix


a
little
sugar
is
added
to
help
the
fermentation
process
along
much
in
the
same
way
beer
is
made


the
amounts
of
each
ingredient
vary
between
the
type
of
kimchi
you
are
making
and
the
personal
taste
of
the
maker


most
kimchi
has
a
special
taste
with
shrimp
or
fish


the
kimchi
is
allowed
to
ferment
for
a
period
of
time
usually
outdoors
in
a
large
<collocation>kimchi pot</collocation>


it
is
also
quite
common
for
these
pots
to
be
buried
under
ground


kimchi
can
be
kept
for
a
long
time
and
does
not
go
bad


koreans
make
kimchi
with
their
families
in
december
