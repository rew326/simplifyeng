a

composite
image
of
antarctica
antarctica
is
covered
by
an
ice
sheet
about
four
kilometres
thick


under
the
ice
it
is
mostly
land
although
the
ice
shelves
are
over
the
ocean


antarctica
has
some
important
features
hidden
by
the
ice


one
is
lake
which
has
been
covered
by
ice
for
at
least
million
years


the
lake
is
km
long
and
km
wide


another
is
the
huge
mountain
chain
which
are
the
size
of
the
alps
yet
entirely
buried
under
the
ice


the
range
has
a
nearby
<collocation>massive rift</collocation>
valley
similar
to
the
east
african
great
rift
valley


it
is
called
the
lambert
system


scientists
used
radar
that
can
work
under
ice
to
survey
the
whole
of
antarctica

<collocation>plants few</collocation>
land
plants
grow
in
antarctica


most
are
moss
lichen
and
algae


this
is
because
antarctica
does
not
have
much
moisture
water
sunlight
good
soil
or
a
warm
temperature


plants
usually
only
grow
for
a
few
weeks
in
the
summer


the
most
important
organisms
in
antarctica
are
the
plankton
which
grow
in
the
ocean


animals
one
important
source
of
food
in
the
antarctic
is
the
krill
which
is
a
general
term
for
the
small
<collocation>marine crustaceans</collocation>


krill
are
near
the
bottom
of
the
food
chain
they
feed
on
and
to
a
<collocation>lesser extent</collocation>


krill
are
a
food
form
suitable
for
the
larger
animals
for
whom
krill
makes
up
the
largest
part
of
their
diet


so
whales
penguins
seals
and
even
some
of
the
birds
that
live
in
the
antarctic
depend
on
krill


whales
are
the
largest
animals
in
the
ocean
and
in
antarctica


they
are
mammals
not
fish


that
means
that
they
breathe
air
and
do
not
lay
eggs


many
different
kinds
of
whales
live
in
the
oceans
around
antarctica


men
have
hunted
whales
for
hundreds
of
years


whale
meat
is
used
for
food


whales
have
a
thick
layer
of
fat
or
blubber
that
can
be
melted
down
to
make
oil


the
oils
are
used
to
light
lamps


penguins
only
live
south
of
the
equator


several
different
kinds
live
in
and
around
antarctica


the
biggest
ones
can
stand
nearly
feet
tall
and
can
weigh
almost
pounds


the
smallest
kinds
are
only
about
one
foot
tall


penguins
are
large
birds
that
swim
very
well
but
can
not
fly


they
have
black
backs
and
wings
with
white
fronts


the
penguins
have
a
thick
layer
of
blubber
that
keeps
them
warm


their
feathers
are
very
tightly
packed
and
they
are
on
top
of
each
other
to
make
another
thick
cover


they
also
have
a
layer
of
woolly
down
under
the
feathers


the
feathers
themselves
are
coated
with
a
type
of
oil
that
makes
them
waterproof


the
penguins
eat
fish
and
are
at
home
in
the
ocean


they
come
up
on
the
land
or
ice
to
lay
their
eggs
and
raise
the
chicks


the
animals
nest
together
in
a
huge
group


history
of
its
discovery
this
snow
surface
is
what
most
of
antarctica
surface
looks
like


antarctica
is
bigger
than
europe
for
a
long
time
people
had
believed
that
there
was
a
great
continent
in
the
far
south
of
earth


they
thought
this
terra
would
balance
the
lands
in
the
north
like
europe
asia
and
north
africa


people
have
believed
this
from
the
times
of
ptolemy
century
ad


he
suggested
this
idea
to
keep
the
balance
of
all
known
lands
in
the
world


pictures
of
a
large
land
in
the
south
were
common
in
maps


in
the
late
century
people
discovered
that
south
america
and
australia
were
not
part
of
the
mythical
antarctica


however
geographers
still
believed
that
antarctica
was
much
bigger
than
it
really
was


european
maps
continued
to
show
this
unknown
land
until
captain
james
cook
ships
resolution
and
adventure
crossed
the
<collocation>antarctic circle</collocation>
on
january
in
december


they
crossed
it
again
in
january


in
fact
cook
did
come
within
about
convert
mi
km
of
the
antarctic
coast


however
he
was
forced
to
go
back
because
of
ice
in
january


the
first
confirmed
sighting
of
antarctica
were
by
three
different
men


according
to
different
organizations
ships
captained
by
three
men
saw
antarctica
in


the
three
men
were
fabian
von
a
captain
in
the
russian
imperial
navy
edward
a
captain
in
the
royal
navy
and
palmer
an
american
<collocation>seal hunter</collocation>
out
of
connecticut


the
first
recorded
landing
on
mainland
antarctica
was
by
the
american
sealer
john
davis


he
landed
on
west
antarctica
on
february


however
some
historians
are
not
sure
about
this
claim


people
began
discovering
different
parts
of
antarctica
and
mapping
them


this
was
slow
work
because
they
could
only
work
in
the
summer


at
last
a
map
was
made
and
people
began
to
talk
about
exploring
the
land
not
only
the
sea


however
this
would
have
been
very
hard
work


they
would
have
to
break
through
the
ice
that
was
around
antarctica


then
they
would
have
to
land
on
it
and
bring
in
enough
things
to
live
on
while
they
explored
the
land


the
first
serious
exploration
of
the
antarctic
land
was
the
nimrod
expedition
led
by
ernest
in


they
were
the
first
to
climb
<collocation>mount erebus</collocation>
and
to
reach
the
south
<collocation>magnetic pole</collocation>


himself
and
three
other
members
of
his
expedition
made
several
firsts
in
december
february


they
were
the
first
humans
to
cross
the
ross
ice
shelf
and
the
mountain
range
via
the
glacier


they
were
the
first
to
set
foot
on
the
south
<collocation>polar plateau</collocation>


robert
<collocation>falcon scott</collocation>
the
most
well
known
of
all
of
the
explorers
wanted
to
be
the
first
man
to
reach
the
south
pole


at
the
same
time
another
team
from
norway
lead
by
started


they
both
raced
each
other
to
the
south
pole
but
in
the
end
won
because
he
had
made
a
good
use
of
his
<collocation>sleigh dogs</collocation>


scott
had
used
ponies
and
<collocation>motor sleds</collocation>
but
when
he
got
to
the
south
pole
he
found
a
message
from
showing
that
he
had
beaten
scott


on
his
way
back
scott
and
three
companions
met
a
blizzard
and
froze
to
death
while
waiting
for
it
to
finish


the
people
who
found
him
eight
months
later
also
found
his
records
and
diary
which
he
had
written
to
the
day
he
died


people
people
of
the
antarctic
live
in
there
for
a
short
time
to
learn
more
about
antarctica
so
most
of
the
people
who
live
there
are
scientists


they
study
the
weather
animals
glaciers
and
the
air
around
our
earth


some
scientists
drill
<collocation>ice cores</collocation>
to
find
out
about
the
weather
<collocation>long ago</collocation>


people
who
work
in
the
antarctic
must
be
very
careful
because
a
blizzard
can
start
any
time
and
any
where


when
they
go
far
away
from
their
shelter
they
must
always
take
lots
of
food
just
in
case


today
people
explore
antarctica
using
snowmobiles
which
are
faster
than
dogs
and
can
pull
<collocation>heavier loads</collocation>


many
come
to
antarctica
just
for
a
short
visit
as
a
trip


there
are
companies
in
south
america
that
have
vacations
to
antarctica
so
people
pay
to
take
a
ship
down
there


some
people
may
just
take
their
own
boats

date
august
the
south
pole
is
the
most
southern
point
on
the
earth


it
is
in
antarctica


in
fact
there
are
two
main
poles


one
is
fixed
and
one
moves
around


the
magnetic
north
and
south
poles
are
where
a
magnetic
compass
points


people
can
tell
they
are
near
these
poles
by
looking
at
a
compass


from
the
south
pole
everywhere
is
north
but
a
compass
is
not
reliable
very
close
to
the
poles


the
geographic
north
and
south
poles
are
the
poles
the
earth
spins
around
the
ones
people
see
on
a
globe
where
all
the
lines
meet


these
poles
stay
in
the
same
place
and
are
usually
the
ones
we
mean
if
we
just
say
north
or
south
pole


people
can
tell
that
they
are
at
these
poles
by
looking
at
the
stars
at
the
poles
a
star
just
circles
around
at
the
same
height
never
dipping
to
the
horizon


antarctica
is
a
very
cold
place


for
many
weeks
in
the
middle
of
winter
the
sun
never
rises


in
the
middle
of
summer
late
december
through
late
march
the
sun
never
sets


at
the
pole
itself
there
is
a
winter
where
the
sun
never
rises


once
the
sun
does
come
up
it
is
the
beginning
of
a
six
month
summer
where
a
person
can
stand
there
at
any
hour
on
the
clock
and
observe
the
sun
above
the
horizon
appearing
to
slowly
travel
around
him


exploration
the
south
pole
is
hard
to
reach


unlike
the
north
pole
which
is
covered
by
the
sea
and
flat
the
south
pole
is
on
a
mountainous
continent


this
continent
is
called
antarctica


it
is
covered
by
thick
ice
more
than
a
mile
thick
in
the
center


the
south
pole
is
very
high
up
and
is
very
windy


it
is
far
from
places
where
people
live
and
ships
going
there
often
have
to
find
their
way
through
thick
sea
ice


once
ashore
explorers
have
to
travel
more
than
a
<collocation>thousand miles</collocation>
to
get
to
the
pole


they
must
cross
a
floating
ice
shelf
then
up
onto
the
land
up
steep
mountain
glaciers
covered
in
broken
twisted
ice
slowly
sliding
to
the
sea
and
across
a
high
level
land
plateau
covered
in
ice
and
swept
by
strong
freezing
winds


two
expeditions
early
in
the
century
led
by
robert
<collocation>falcon scott</collocation>
and
then
ernest
failed
to
reach
the
south
pole
but
returned
safely


turned
back
quite
close
to
the
pole
but
it
was
late
in
the
season
and
supplies
were
low


he
knew
that
he
would
be
risking
the
lives
of
his
men
so
he
turned
back


the
first
men
to
reach
the
south
pole
were
a
group
from
norway
led
by


they
arrived
at
the
pole
on
december
and
left
the
norwegian
flag


and
his
men
returned
home
safely


story
is
one
of
excellent
planning
good
leadership
and
willingness
to
learn
from
others
this
made
<collocation>extreme endurance</collocation>
unnecessary
and
perhaps
made
the
successful
expedition
less
of
a
story
and
therefore
perhaps
less
famous
than
the
next
one


the
most
famous
south
pole
expedition
is
perhaps
the
one
that
failed
badly


this
was
the
british
expedition
not
just
it
included
people
from
the
british
empire
who
at
that
time
were
considered
british
citizens
led
by
robert
<collocation>falcon scott</collocation>


scott
and
four
other
men
dragging
their
equipment
on
had
hoped
to
be
first
to
the
pole


when
they
arrived
they
saw
a
norwegian
flag


a
letter
left
for
scott
showed
that
and
his
men
had
beaten
them
by
a
month
by
using
dogs
to
pull
their


on
their
journey
back
from
the
pole
scott
team
found
that
food
dumps
were
short
of
supplies
particularly
kerosene


kerosene
was
very
important
not
just
for
cooking
but
for
melting
ice


once
it
ran
out
they
would
have
no
water
to
drink


one
man
collapsed
and
died
while
walking


knew
his
<collocation>frostbitten feet</collocation>
could
not
carry
him
back
to
base
and
that
he
might
delay
his
companions
and
risk
their
lives


he
committed
suicide
by
walking
out
of
their
tent
into
the
cold


scott
and
his
remaining
two
companions
died
of
starvation
thirst
and
cold
trapped
in
the
tent
by
bad
weather
until
their
supplies
ran
out


next
spring
the
three
bodies
in
the
tent
were
found
by
a
team
from
the
main
part
of
the
expedition
who
had
spent
the
winter
in
the
expeditions
hut
by
the
sea


scott
letters
to
his
wife
written
in
the
tent
when
he
knew
he
was
going
to
die
have
just
been
made
public


apart
from
ernest
expedition
to
cross
the
antarctic
another
<collocation>heroic failure</collocation>
but
saved
all
his
men
after
a
very
courageous
sea
crossing
in
an
open
boat
and
a
crossing
of
an
unknown
mountain
range
while
starving
and
freezing
this
was
the
end
of
the
heroic
age
of
exploration


motors
planes
radios
and
gps
ensured
that
following
expeditions
were
never
truly
unsupported


today
there
is
an
american
science
base
at
the
south
pole


it
is
named

is
the
ocean
around

the
most
northern
parts
of

are
around
the
arctic

cover
almost
all
of

can
use
the
arctic

eskimo
is
a
term
more
frequently
used
in
mainstream
united
states
where
the
concerns
and
of
arctic
peoples
are
easily
dismissed
as
they
have
little
political
power
in

ate
both
raw
and
cooked
meat
and
fish


whale
blubber
was
burned
as
fuel
for
cooking
and
lamps


were
also
nomads
but
they
did
not
domesticate
any
animals
except
for
dogs
which
they
used
to
pull
their
sleds
and
help
with
the
hunting


they
were
living
off
the
land


they
were
very
careful
to
make
good
use
of
every
part
of
the
animals
they
killed


respect
for
the
land
and
the
animals
they
harvested
was
and
is
a
focal
part
of
their
culture


lived
in
tents
made
of
animal
skins
during
the
summer


in
the
winter
they
lived
in
<collocation>sod houses</collocation>
and
igloos


they
could
build
an
igloo
out
of
snow
bricks
in
just
a
couple
of
hours


snow
is
full
of
air
spaces
which
helps
it
hold
in
warmth


with
just
a
<collocation>blubber lamp</collocation>
for
heat
an
igloo
could
be
warmer
than
the
air
outside


the
made
very
clever
things
from
the
bones
antlers
and
wood
they
had


they
invented
the
broken
link
harpoon
harpoon
which
was
used
to
<collocation>hunt seals</collocation>
and
whales


they
built
boats
from
wood
or
bone
covered
with
animal
skins


they
invented
the
kayak
for
one
man
to
use
for
hunting
the
ocean
and
among
the
pack
ice


sleds
could
be
built
from
wood
bone
or
even
animal
skins
wrapped
around
frozen
fish


dishes
were
made
from
carving
soapstone
bones
or
musk
<collocation>ox horns</collocation>


they
wore
two
layers
of
skins
one
fur
side
in
the
other
facing
out
to
stay
warm


had
to
be
good
hunters
to
survive


when
an
animal
was
killed
in
a
hunt
it
was
thanked
respectfully
for
offering
itself
to
the
hunter


they
believed
it
intended
to
provide
itself
as
a
gift
towards
the
survival
of
the
hunter
and
his
children


their
gratitude
was
deeply
sincere
and
is
an
important
aspect
of
their
belief
system


in
the
winter
seals
did
not
come
out
onto
the
ice


they
only
came
up
for
air
at
holes
they
chewed
in
the
ice


would
use
their
dogs
to
find
the
air
holes
then
wait
patiently
until
the
seal
came
back
to
breathe
and
kill
it
with
a
broken
link
harpoon
harpoon


in
the
summer
the
seals
would
lie
out
on
the
ice
enjoying
the
sun


the
hunter
would
have
to
slowly
creep
up
on
a
seal
to
kill
it
