structure
uncircumcised
penis
with
retracted
foreskin
and
exposed
glans
the
human
penis
is
made
up
of
three
types
of
tissue


it
has
two
corpora
special
pieces
of
muscle
next
to
each
other
and
a
corpus
spongy
muscle
between
them


the
end
of
the
corpus
forms
the
glans
penis
underneath
the
foreskin
in
<collocation>uncircumcised men</collocation>
or
exposed
in
circumcised
men


the
area
on
the
bottom
of
the
penis
where
the
foreskin
is
attached
is
known
as
the
frenulum


the
urethra
the
tube
where
urine
and
semen
travel
through
runs
down
the
corpus
spongy
tissue
and
opens
at
the
tip
of
the
penis


sperm
are
made
in
the
testes
organs
and
stored
in
the
epididymis
layer
of
tissue
around
the
testes


during
ejaculation
sperm
are
pushed
up
the
vas
deferens


fluids
are
added
by
the
seminal
vesicles
the
prostate
gland
and
the
glands
to
make
semen


erection
the
picture
on
the
left
shows
a
penis
that
is
flaccid
not
erect
and
the
one
on
the
right
shows
an
erect
penis
main
erection
a
penis
can
become
erect
if
a
man
is
sexually
aroused
or
sometimes
during
sleep
even
though
there
is
no
<collocation>sexual stimulation</collocation>


in
an
erection
the
penis
fills
with
blood


the
blood
makes
the
penis
become
longer
thicker
and
harder


veins
taking
blood
away
from
the
penis
get
smaller
so
less
blood
is
taken
through


arteries
bringing
blood
to
the
penis
get
wider
bringing
more
blood
to
the
penis


ejaculation
main
ejaculation
ejaculation
is
when
semen
is
pushed
from
the
penis


it
usually
happens
during
an
orgasm


men
can
ejaculate
during
<collocation>sexual intercourse</collocation>
or
by
masturbation


when
a
man
has
<collocation>sexual intercourse</collocation>
with
a
woman
he
places
his
erect
penis
within
her
vagina
and
moves
it
in
and
out


the
vagina
is
warm
and
soft
and
it
places
pressure
on
the
man
penis


this
makes
the
man
have
an
orgasm
and
ejaculate


during
orgasm
muscles
push
semen
from
the
penis
and
into
the
vagina


<collocation>semen moves</collocation>
through
the
urethra
and
comes
out
of
the
hole
at
the
tip
of
the
penis


in
masturbation
a
man
can
excite
his
own
penis
and
other
sensitive
areas
of
his
body
such
as
the
scrotum
by
rubbing
the
genital
area


ejaculation
may
also
happen
during
sleep
called
a
<collocation>wet dream</collocation>


a
man
must
have
started
puberty
before
he
can
ejaculate


<collocation>penis size</collocation>
in
humans
main
human
<collocation>penis size</collocation>
the
length
and
thickness
of
the
penis
is
different
for
different
men


the
size
of
a
soft
penis
not
erect
is
much
smaller
than
when
it
is
erect


some
penises
grow
more
when
they
get
hard
than
other
penises


in
most
cases
whether
a
penis
is
big
or
small
it
can
still
be
used
for
sex


it
averages
out
to
be
around
to
inches
long
when
not
erect


the
average
size
of
an
erect
human
penis
is
between
cm
in


the
average
circumference
of
a
penis
is
cm

circumcision
the
foreskin
is
a
fold
of
skin
that
covers
the
end
of
the
penis


cutting
off
the
foreskin
is
called
circumcision


the
foreskin
is
connected
to
the
head
of
the
penis


during
circumcision
the
foreskin
is
removed
from
the
penis


circumcision
is
usually
performed
on
infant
males
for
religious
or
cultural
reasons


some
men
have
the
<collocation>foreskin cut</collocation>
off
when
they
are
adults
because
they
have
problems
with
their
foreskin


some
men
have
the
<collocation>foreskin cut</collocation>
off
because
they
want
to
change
how
their
penis
looks


in
some
religions
babies
and
young
boys
have
their
<collocation>foreskin cut</collocation>
off


this
is
expected
in
islam
and
judaism


it
is
not
required
according
to
christianity
but
it
is
allowed
and
is
quite
common
among
some
christians


in
judaism
baby
boys
are
required
to
have
their
foreskin
removed
as
a
sign
of
the
covenant
made
with
god

why
were
the
jews
killed


there
was
hatred
and
persecution
of
jews
in
europe
for
hundreds
of
years


many
people
wrongly
thought
that
all
jews
were
rich
mean
and
not
social


these
simple
ideas
were
popular
in
the
german
speaking
world
and
elsewhere
in
the
late


hitler
was
born
in
austria
during
this
time
when
many
people
disliked
jews


he
may
have
been
jealous
of
jewish
success
in
austria
but
he
also
wrote
down
his
belief
that
jews
were
to
blame
for
economic
problems
and
that
they
were
to
blame
for
germany
and
austria
losing
<collocation>world war</collocation>
many
people
agreed
with
hitler
ideas
and
supported
him
as
the
leader
of
the
nazis


deaths
the
numbers
below
are
not
known
entirely
because
many
of
those
killed
were
never
written
down


the
numbers
given

are
those
most
thinkers
agree
on

polish

led

the
nazis
led
an
<collocation>unprecedented mass</collocation>
slaying
of
millions
of
jews


jews
were
forced
to
wear
the
golden
star
of
david
on
any
highly
noticeable
part
of
their
upper
body


jews
were
rounded
up
by
the
thousands
and
crammed
into
trains
that
took
them
to
concentration
camps
as
well
as
death
camps


most
of
the
jews
killed
in
the
holocaust
were
not
german
they
were
from
poland
or
the
soviet
union


millions
of
jews
were
murdered
by
the
usage
of
gas
chambers
used
to
suffocate
hundreds
of
people
at
a
time
in
<collocation>packed rooms</collocation>
and
ovens
where
jews
were
burned
alive


others
were
sent
to
dig
giant
holes
in
the
ground
where
after
days
of
hard
work
they
were
shot
buried
and
burned
in
a
mass
grave


others
were
shot
beaten
or
stabbed
to
death


still
others
were
trampled
by
other
jews
in
merciless
marches
from
one
camp
to
another


on
the
other
hand
there
were
people
who
saved
jews
from
the
holocaust
out
of
conscience
and
with
courage
against
oppression


they
were
later
awarded
righteous
among
the
nations


<collocation>holocaust denial</collocation>
some
people
say
the
holocaust
did
not
happen
at
all
or
they
say
that
it
is
described
wrongly
