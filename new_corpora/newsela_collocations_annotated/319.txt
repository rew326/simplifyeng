where
the
word
catholic
came
from
the
oldest
document
that
uses
the
name
catholic
church
is
a
letter
written
by
a
man
named


lived
in
the
ancient
city
of


in
the
year
wrote
a
letter
addressed
to
the
christian
community
in
the
ancient
city
of
smyrna


in
this
letter
encouraged
the
christian
community
to
be
loyal
to
their
leader
the
bishop


wrote
wherever
the
bishop
shall
appear
there
let
the
multitude
of
the
people
also
be
even
as
wherever
<collocation>jesus christ</collocation>
is
there
is
the
catholic
church


groups
who
call
themselves
catholic
many
different
denominations
groups
of
christians
call
themselves
catholic


often
these
groups
have
special
beliefs
about
their
leaders
called
bishops


they
believe
jesus
of
nazareth
whom
christians
believe
is
the
son
of
god
appointed
the
first
bishops
who
appointed
future
bishops
who
eventually
appointed
each
community
current
bishops


this
appointing
of
leaders
is
called
succession


the
groups
that
use
the
term
catholic
to
talk
about
themselves
are
the
catholic
church
which
is
also
called
the
roman
catholic
church


eastern
orthodox
and
<collocation>oriental orthodox</collocation>
old
catholic
anglican
and
some
lutheran
and
other
groups
others
who
believe
in
succession
but
do
not
often
call
themselves
catholic


communities
that
believe
they
lost
their
succession
but
asked
a
different
community
to
ordain
new
leaders
for
them


ordain
or
consecrate
is
a
word
for
the
ceremony
that
makes
a
bishop
or
new
religious
leader


not
all
communities
believe
that
other
communities
use
the
term
catholic
properly


also
not
all
communities
believe
that
the
other
communities
have
succession
either


for
example
the
catholic
church
believes
that
the
eastern
orthodox
have
succession


however
the
catholic
church
does
believe
that
that
the
or
lutherans
have
succession


eastern
orthodox
have
similar
beliefs
about
and
lutherans


however
not
all
eastern
orthodox
believe
that
the
catholic
church
has
succession


different
members
of
the
eastern
<collocation>orthodox churches</collocation>
have
different
opinions


however
the
and
lutherans
generally
believe
that
all
christians
are
part
of
the
catholic
church


these
groups
have
a
very
different
understanding
of
the
term
catholic


history
how
it
was
started
catholicism
was
started
by
jesus
of
nazareth
a
jewish
man
whom
christians
believe
was
the
son
of
god
a
christian
belief
known
as
the
trinity


christians
believe
jesus
to
be
a
descendant
of
david
a
jewish
king
from
a
long
time
ago


jesus
was
executed
killed
by
the
romans
in
the
year
ad


christians
believe
jesus
rose
from
the
dead
and
spoke
to
his
followers
called
the
twelve
apostles


christians
also
believe
that
jesus
rose
into
heaven
and
then
sent
the
holy
spirit
to
guide
his
followers
at
an
event
known
as
pentecost


one
of
his
followers
the
apostle
named
saint
peter
was
appointed
leader
by
jesus
and
later
became
recognized
as
the
first
pope
or
bishop
of
rome
soon
after
that
he
was
captured
and
died
in
rome


catholics
believe
saint
peter
was
given
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
meaning
that
jesus
made
him
and
the
apostles
in
charge
of
forgiving
sins


today
the
pope
is
pope
francis
who
is
the
leader
of
the
catholic
church


the
word
pope
comes
from
the
latin
word
for
father


in
the
first
council
of
agreed
on
how
to
organize
the
church


the
council
agreed
the
church
had
five
patriarchs
patriarch
was
the
highest
type
of
church
leader


the
five
leaders
were
the
archbishops
of
rome
the
pope
alexandria
constantinople
and
jerusalem


the
patriarch
of
rome
was
honored
as
first
among
equals


quarrels
within
the
church
in
time
several
churches
split
off
from
the
catholic
church
because
of
differing
opinions
of
theology


this
caused
breaks
in
the
church
called


most
happened
because
people
had
different
beliefs
about
what
is
true


in
a
church
division
happened
when
all
the
church
leaders
meeting
at
the
church
council
in
the
city
of
excommunicated
cut
off
three
leaders
because
they
held
to
and
would
not
accept
the
view
that
jesus
had
two
natures
fully
divine
and
fully
human


these
three
were
the
bishops
of
egypt
syria
and
armenia


of
course
these
three
bishops
did
not
accept
being
excommunicated
either
so
the
churches
under
them
are
still
known
today
as
<collocation>oriental orthodox</collocation>
churches


in
the
church
split
in
two
in
the
schism


the
church
in
western
europe
which
followed
the
pope
became
known
as
the
roman
catholic
church
and
the
churches
in
the
rest
of
the
world
which
did
not
think
that
the
pope
should
lead
all
christians
became
known
as
the
orthodox
church
orthodox
means
correct
belief
as
they
believe
that
they
have
kept
the
teachings
of
the
early
church
and
the
roman
catholics
have
not


the
next
split
was
the
<collocation>protestant reformation</collocation>


protestants
resisted
the
central
authority
of
the
church
in
rome
and
rejected
many
practices
beliefs
and
disciplines


the
reformation
started
in
germany
where
martin
luther
sent
his
demands
for
change
to
the
church


because
of
politics
in
europe
many
nations
supported
luther


the
lutheran
church
was
started


later
the
calvinist
or
presbyterian
church
started


in
england
king
henry
started
the
anglican
church


he
wanted
to
divorce
his
first
wife
but
the
pope
would
not
grant
him
permission


at
first
the
church
of
king
henry
the
church
of
england
was
very
similar
to
the
catholic
church


the
major
difference
was
that
the
king
was
head
of
the
church
instead
of
the
pope


later
under
his
son
edward
vi
the
anglican
church
became
more
reformed
or
protestant


and
several
other
<collocation>protestant denominations</collocation>
still
believe
they
are
reformed
catholics


puritanism
arose
among
who
thought
the
reforms
did
go
far
enough


after
the
reformation
many
other
churches
began
because
of
disagreements
over
beliefs
and
practices
of
earlier
protestant
doctrine


according
to
the
religious
congregations
and
membership
study
this
accounts
for
most
of
the
<collocation>protestant denominations</collocation>
in
the
united
states


there
are
about
of
these


two
examples
of
these
protestant
or
reformed
churches
are
methodist
and
baptist


<collocation>religious beliefs</collocation>
what
is
the
same
as
other
christians
the
ten
commandments
the
belief
that
god
knows
everything


the
belief
that
<collocation>jesus christ</collocation>
died
rose
again
and
one
day
will
come
again
in
glory
to
judge
the
living
and
the
dead


the
importance
of
worshipping
god


what
is
different
from
eastern
orthodox
christians
catholics
are
different
from
followers
of
the
eastern
orthodox
church
in
that
they
have
a
different
approach
to
the
trinity


christians
believe
that
god
has
three
aspects
the
father
the
son
and
the
holy
spirit


eastern
<collocation>orthodox churches</collocation>
believe
these
are
three
different
persons
of
one
divine
essence
roman
catholics
believe
god
is
of
one
substance
in
three
persons
consubstantiation


the
filioque
clause
creed
what
is
different
from
<collocation>mainstream protestants</collocation>
catholics
believe
in
the
real
presence
of
christ
in
the
eucharist
this
is
called
transubstantiation


roman
catholics
believe
god
can
forgive
sins
through
the
sacrament
of
reconciliation
penance
done
by
a
priest
while
most
protestants
do
not
believe
the
priest
is
needed
roman
catholics
believe
it
is
important
to
live
by
scripture
and
tradition
which
the
teaching
of
the
church
magisterium
the
bishops
in
communion
with
the
pope
come
from
while
most
protestants
believe
in
sola
the
bible
alone
roman
catholics
believe
that
papal
authority
and
the
bible
are
infallible
while
most
protestants
believe
in
an
infallible
bible
but
not
an
infallible
pope


papal
infallibility
has
been
declared
twice
in
the
history
of
the
catholic
church


once
to
state
that
mary
was
conceived
without
sin
and
another
to
state
that
mary
was
assumed
into
heaven
body
and
soul


the
bible
roman
catholics
use
often
include
a
few
texts
that
are
usually
not
used
by
protestants


the
best
known
are
called
the
books


roman
catholics
venerate
saints
especially
the
virgin
mary
mother
of
god


saints
means
that
roman
catholics
give
special
honor
to
saints
people
in
heaven
because
they
believe
that
saints
can
pray
for
them
directly
to
god


many
protestants
do
not
because
they
regard
saints
as
worshiping
saints


because
they
believe
that
only
god
should
be
worshipped
they
do
not
venerate


many
protestants
also
simply
do
not
believe
that
any
veneration
is
necessary


the
interpretation
of
mary
as
the
mother
of
god
differs


nails
distinguish
fingernail
a
nail
is
a
metal
object
with
a
flat
head
and
a
long
sharp
tip


a
hammer
or
nail
gun
is
used
to
put
it
into
another
object


it
is
often
used
to

a
dictatorship
is
a
country
where
one
person
or
political
party
has
the
power
to
do
whatever
he
she
or
they
want


the
ruler
is
called
a
dictator


in
a
dictatorship
people
usually
do
not
have
many
rights
or
much
freedom


dictators
come
to
power
for
a
number
of
reasons
or
social
problems
such
as
massive
unemployment
inflation
and
unrest
among
the
population


dictators
are
normally
backed
by
powerful
groups
such
as
landowners
private
company
owners
bank
owners
and
in
some
cases
institutions
like
the
roman
catholic
church
to
put
in
place
law
and
order
by
force


this
force
is
generally
directed
at
the
poorer
parts
of
society
such
as
unemployed
workers
<collocation>ethnic minorities</collocation>
working
class
areas
and
<collocation>shanty towns</collocation>


examples
of
this
are
the
dictatorships
in
latin
america


dictators
normally
need
to
do
a
number
of
things
to
put
in
place
their
dictatorships
they
need
to
get
rid
of
their
opponents
which
may
be
political
or
religious
some
are
imprisoned
exiled
sent
outside
their
country
or
killed


dictators
will
then
need
to
prohibit
or
not
allow
political
parties
that
oppose
their
rule


they
will
confiscate
the
political
parties
property
or
offices
and
such
things


dictators
may
suppress
or
persecute
some
religious
groups
or
institutions


dictators
will
also
need
to
undo
or
close
down
democratic
institutions
such
as
parliament
and
in
some
cases
the
congress


some
social
organizations
such
as
civil
rights
groups
<collocation>human rights</collocation>
organizations
legal
aid
centers
students
unions
teachers
federations
trade
or
workers
unions
are
also
undone
and
those
who
persist
with
such
activities
may
be
killed


dictators
will
normally
rewrite
an
existing
constitution
or
put
in
place
a
completely
new
one


this
makes
their
power
constitutional
which
then
can
not
be
disputed


dictators
then
maintain
their
rule
with
state
terrorism
which
normally
involves
a
secret
police
death
squads
random
or
<collocation>night curfew</collocation>
<collocation>indefinite arrest</collocation>
without
trial
and
a
network
of
torture
centers
and
concentration
camps


some
dictatorships
create
a
fictional
or
non
existent
internal
inside
their
country
enemy
which
they
claim
to
be
at
war
with
to
justify
give
reason
for
their
use
of
much
military
violence
against
a
whole
unarmed
population


a
dictatorship
that
is
ruled
by
soldiers
is
called
a
military
dictatorship
or
junta


an
<collocation>absolute monarchy</collocation>
the
system
where
there
are
kings
and
queens
who
have
full
power
over
their
country
can
be
considered
to
be
a
dictatorship
but
are
usually
not
called
dictators


a
dictatorship
is
usually
not
liked
by
the
people
because
most
do
like
to
be
dictated
around


most
dictators
are
selfish
and
rule
over
the
people
just
for
power

electricity
in

electricity
is
a
force
caused
by
electric
charge


it
is
a
form
of
energy
which
we
use
to
power
machines
and
<collocation>electrical devices</collocation>


when
the
charges
are
not
moving
electricity
is
called
<collocation>static electricity</collocation>


when
the
charges
are
moving
they
are
an
electric
current
sometimes
called
dynamic
electricity


<collocation>static electricity</collocation>
occurs
when
the
number
of
electrons
of
atoms
in
a
material
are
either
more
than
usual
or
less
than
usual


if
the
electrons
stay
where
they
are
the
atom
that
has
too
many
or
too
few
electrons
will
attract
or
sometimes
repel
other
atoms


if
the
electrons
move
from
where
there
are
too
many
to
where
there
are
too
few
a
flow
of
electrons
will
occur
an
electrical
current


there
is
electricity
in
nature
as
well
as
electricity
that
is


we
see
electricity
in
nature
as
lightning
and
as
the
way
some
things
attract
each
other
and
stick
together


scientists
have
found
we
can
make
electricity
if
we
pass
a
magnet
close
to
a
metal
wire
or
if
we
put
the
right
chemicals
in
a
jar
with
two
different
kinds
of
metal
rods


we
can
also
make
<collocation>static electricity</collocation>
by
rubbing
two
things
for
instance
a
<collocation>wool cap</collocation>
and
a
plastic
ruler
together


this
may
make
a
spark


scientists
have
observed
that
electricity
can
flow
like
water
from
one
place
to
another
either
as
a
spark
or
as
a
current
in
a
metal


they
now
know
that
all
matter
has
an
electric
charge
but
this
is
mostly
canceled
out
by
the
presence
of
matter
with
an
opposite
charge


we
only
see
an
effect
when
there
is
too
much
or
too
little
electric
charge
in
one
place
so
that
it
is
not
canceled
out


since
the
<collocation>nineteenth century</collocation>
electricity
has
been
used
in
every
part
of
our
lives


until
then
it
was
just
a
curiosity
or
a
force
of
nature
seen
in
a
thunderstorm


people
make
most
our
electric
energy
in
generators


the
biggest
generators
are
in
power
stations


some
of
our
electricity
comes
from
<collocation>photovoltaic cells</collocation>
or
from
batteries


electricity
arrives
at
our
homes
through
wires
from
the
places
where
it
is
made


it
is
used
by
electric
lamps
for
producing
light
<collocation>electric heaters</collocation>
to
produce
heat


it
is
also
used
by
many
devices
such
as
washing
machines
<collocation>electric cookers</collocation>
for
doing
work


in
factories
electricity
is
used
for
running
machines
and
computers


the
people
who
deal
with
electricity
and
<collocation>electrical devices</collocation>
in
our
homes
and

are
called

works
because
electric
charges
push
and
pull
on
each
other


there
are
two
types
of
electric
charges
positive
charges
and
negative
charges


similar
charges
repel
each
other


this
means
that
if
you
put
two
positive
charges
close
together
and
let
them
go
they
would
move
apart


two
negative
charges
also
repel


but
different
charges
attract
each
other


this
means
that
if
you
put
a
positive
charge
and
a
negative
charge
close
together
they
would
smack
together


a
short
way
to
remember
this
is
the
phrase
opposites
attract
likes
repel


electric
charges
push
or
pull
on
each
other
if
they
are
not
touching


this
is
possible
because
each
charge
makes
an
electric
field
around
itself


an
electric
field
is
an
area
that
surrounds
a
charge


at
each
point
near
a
charge
the
electric
field
points
in
a
certain
direction


if
a
positive
charge
is
put
at
that
point
it
will
be
pushed
in
that
direction


if
a
negative
charge
is
put
at
that
point
it
will
be
pushed
in
the
exact
opposite
direction


all
the
matter
in
the
world
is
made
of
tiny
positive
and
negative
charges


the
positive
charges
are
called
protons
and
the
negative
charges
are
called
electrons


protons
are
much
bigger
and
heavier
than
electrons
but
they
both
have
the
same
amount
of
electric
charge
except
that
protons
are
positive
and
electrons
are
negative


because
opposites
attract
protons
and
electrons
stick
together


a
few
protons
and
electrons
can
form
bigger
particles
called
atoms
and
molecules


atoms
and
molecules
are
still
very
tiny


it
is
impossible
to
see
them
without
a
very
powerful
microscope


any
big
object
like
your
body
has
more
atoms
and
molecules
in
it
than
anyone
could
count


because
negative
electrons
and
positive
protons
stick
together
to
make
big
objects
all
big
objects
that
we
can
see
and
feel
are
electrically
neutral


electrically
is
a
word
meaning
describing
electricity
and
neutral
is
a
word
meaning
balanced


that
is
why
we
do
not
feel
objects
pushing
and
pulling
on
us
from
a
distance
like
they
would
if
everything
was
electrically
charged


all
big
objects
are
electrically
neutral
because
there
is
exactly
the
same
amount
of
positive
and
negative
charge
in
the
world


we
could
say
that
the
world
is
exactly
balanced
or
neutral


this
seems
very
surprising
and
lucky


scientists
still
do
not
know
why
this
is
so
even
though
they
have
been
studying
electricity
for
a
long
time


electric
current
a
drawing
of
an
electrical
circuit
the
current
i
flows
from
round
the
circuit
back
to
electricity
is
sent
on
wires


in
some
materials
electrons
are
stuck
tightly
in
place
while
in
other
materials
electrons
can
move
all
around
the
material


protons
never
move
around
a
solid
object
because
they
are
so
heavy
at
least
compared
to
the
electrons


a
material
that
lets
electrons
move
around
is
called
a
conductor


a
material
that
keeps
each
electron
tightly
in
place
is
called
an
insulator


examples
of
conductors
are
copper
aluminum
silver
and
gold


examples
of
are
rubber
plastic
and
wood


copper
is
used
very
often
as
a
conductor
because
it
is
a
very
good
conductor
and
there
is
so
much
of
it
in
the
world


but
sometimes
other
materials
are
used


inside
a
conductor
electrons
bounce
around
but
they
do
not
keep
going
in
one
direction
for
long


if
an
electric
field
is
set
up
inside
the
conductor
the
electrons
will
all
start
to
move
in
the
direction
opposite
to
the
direction
the
field
is
pointing
because
electrons
are
negatively
charged


a
battery
can
make
an
electric
field
inside
a
conductor


if
both
ends
of
a
piece
of
wire
are
connected
to
the
two
ends
of
a
battery
called
the
electrodes
the
loop
that
was
made
is
called
an
electrical
circuit


electrons
will
flow
around
and
around
the
circuit
as
long
as
the
battery
is
making
an
electric
field
inside
the
wire


this
flow
of
electrons
around
the
circuit
is
called
electric
current


a
conducting
wire
used
to
carry
electric
current
is
often
wrapped
in
an
insulator
such
as
rubber


this
is
because
wires
that
carry
current
are
very
dangerous


if
a
person
or
an
animal
touched
a
bare
wire
carrying
current
they
could
get
hurt
or
even
die
depending
on
how
strong
the
current
was


you
should
be
careful
around
<collocation>electrical sockets</collocation>
and
<collocation>bare wires</collocation>
that
might
be
carrying
current


it
is
possible
to
connect
an
electrical
device
to
a
circuit
so
that
electrical
current
will
flow
through
a
device


this
current
will
make
the
device
do
something
that
we
want
it
to
do


<collocation>electrical devices</collocation>
can
be
very
simple


for
example
in
a
light
bulb
current
flows
through
a
special
wire
called
a
filament
which
makes
it
glow


<collocation>electrical devices</collocation>
can
also
be
very
complicated


electricity
can
be
used
to
drive
an
electric
motor
inside
a
tool
like
a
drill
or
a
pencil
sharpener


electricity
is
also
used
to
power
modern
electronic
devices
including
telephones
computers
and
televisions


some
