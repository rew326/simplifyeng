in


within
a
year
they
were
promoted
again
and
the
club
has
not
been
relegated
again
since


this
makes
them
the
english
football
team
with
the
most
consecutive
seasons
in
the
top
league
of
english
football

cup
champions
their
first
and
only
european
title
to
date


in
several
liverpool
and
fans
died
when
the
crowd
started
fighting
at
a
stadium
in
germany


decided
that
liverpool
fans
were
mainly
to
blame


because
of
this
all
english
clubs
were
not
allowed
to
play
against
european
teams


this
denied
the
chance
to
defend
their
european
title
and
the
team
gradually
broke
up
selling
many
of
their
best
players
to
other
european
clubs


the
club
did
not
do
very
well
in
the
early
nearly
getting
relegated
twice
and
going
through
lots
of
money
problems


however
they
still
became
one
of
the
first
members
of
the
new
english
premier
league
when
it
started
in


they
were
quite
successful
under
a
manager
called
joe
who
took
over
in


in
his
second
season
in
charge
he
kept
clear
of
and
won
the
fa
cup
the
club
first
trophy
in
seven
years


the
club
had
steady
improvement
under
finishing
and
in
the
and
seasons


after
two
seasons
however
the
club
performance
went
downhill
and
was
sacked
after
only
narrowly
avoiding
in
the
season


former
player
walter
smith
took
over
for
three
seasons
but
failed
to
perform
spending
a
lot
of
money
but
not
getting
the
team
to
good
league
positions


david
took
over
in
and
has
been
one
of
the
club
most
successful
managers
to
date


under
his
management
the
club
has
become
a
regular
top
side
finishing
in
their
highest
ever
premier
league
finish


under
his
management
wayne
was
brought
into
the
first
team
and
he
was
quickly
sold
to
manchester
united
for
million
a
club
record
fee


since
have
enjoyed
regular
top
finishes
and
reached
the
last
of
the
cup
in
and
the
fa
cup
final
in


kit
usually
wear
royal
blue
shirts
with
white
shorts
and
blue
socks


they
wore
many
different
kit
colors
in
their
first
few
years


at
first
they
wore
white
shorts
and
white
shirts
with
blue
stripes


however
many
players
who
moved
to
still
wore
the
shirts
of
their
old
team
so
things
quickly
got
confusing


to
solve
this
the
club
introduced
an
all
black
kit
to
the
club
as
black
dye
was
cheap
and
easily
available


however
many
fans
thought
this
was
quite
boring
and
slightly
broken
link
morbid
morbid
so
a
red
band
was
added
across
the
chest


it
was
not
until
the
season
that
the
colors
of
royal
blue
and
white
were
first
introduced


this
kit
has
stayed
with
a
few
small
changes
almost
exactly
the
same
from
then
until
the
present
day
