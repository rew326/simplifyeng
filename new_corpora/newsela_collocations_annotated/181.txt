there
are
tires
on
many
vehicles
such
as
cars
airplanes
bicycles
wheelbarrows
and
other
things
that
need
to
move
around
smoothly


tires
need
to
be
changed
after
their
treads
wear
away


driving
with
worn
tires
is
very
dangerous


it
can
cause
the
tire
to
explode
and
the
driver
to
lose
control


construction
tires
are
made
of
different
types
of
rubber


softer
rubber
is
used
in
summer
or
when
the
tires
need
better
traction
for
example
in
auto
racing


tires
made
of
harder
rubber
are
made
for
long
lasting
performance
like
<collocation>truck carriers</collocation>


there
are
many
different
types
of
tires


they
come
in
different
sizes
and
have
different
tread
patterns


there
are
many
different
sizes
of
tires


on
car
and
truck
tires
they
are
marked
with
numbers
and
might
look
like


the
first
number
is
the
width
in
millimeters
of
the
tire
at
the
widest
point
when
it
is
mounted
and
inflated


the
second
number
is
the
sidewall
side
of
the
tire
height
as
a
ratio
or
percentage
of
the
width


the
last
number
is
the
wheel
diameter
in
inches

very
large
tires
for
example
tires
on
big
mining
trucks
use
different
units


for
example


the
first
number
is
the
width
in
inches
of
the
tire


the
second
number
is
the
<collocation>sidewall height</collocation>
as
a
ratio
of
the
width


the
last
number
is
the
wheel
diameter
in
inches


tire
damage
most
tires
today
do
not
have
a
tube
inside
of
them


there
are
grooves
in
the
wheel
that
let
the
tire
be
popped
into
place
and
hold
a
lot
of
air
pressure


if
there
is
a
crack
in
the
tire
it
will
not
be
able
to
hold
its
air


tire
leaks
are
very
common


the
most
common
cause
is
a
hole
from
a
nail
or
screw


this
can
usually
be
fixed
by
patching
the
inside
of
the
tire
so
that
it
can
hold
air
again


if
the
hole
is
close
to
or
in
the
side
of
the
tire
it
can
not
be
fixed


this
is
because
the
sides
of
the
tire
flexes
to
support
the
weight
of
the
vehicle


a
patch
will
not
be
able
to
handle
the
stress


distribution
of
world
population
in


a
population
is
the
number
of
living
things
that
live
together
in
the
same
place


a
city
population
is
the
number
of
people
living
in
that
city


these
people
are
called
inhabitants
or
residents


the
population
includes
all
individuals
that
live
in
that
certain
area


<collocation>population density</collocation>
is
the
average
number
of
people
in
a
place


urban
areas
such
as
big
cities
have
a
high
<collocation>population density</collocation>


people
there
live
close
to
each
other


in
areas
with
a
low
<collocation>population density</collocation>
people
usually
live
far
away
from
each
other
such
as
in
rural
areas
out
in
the
countryside


usually
population
is
about
the
number
of
humans
in
a
certain
area


sometimes
it
about
animals


the
maximum
population
that
can
be
supported
in
an
area
is
called
the
carrying
capacity


population
trends
the
world
population
reached
seven
billion
people
in


global
population
is
going
up
but
the
population
growth
rate
is
declining
all
over
the
world


urbanization
is
also
common


currently
india

snow
is
a
form
of
ice


snow
forms
when
water
in
the
atmosphere
becomes
frozen


snow
comes
in
all
different
shapes
and
sizes


at
the
freezing
point
of
water
celsius
fahrenheit
snow
melts
and
becomes
liquid
water


sometimes
the
snow
will
melt
very
fast
and
become
water
vapor


this
is
called
sublimation


the
opposite
where
water
vapor
becomes
snow
is
called
deposition


snow
is
used
for
some
winter
sport
activities
like
skiing
and
sledding


people
also
commonly
build
things
out
of
snow
for
fun


snow
can
also
be
dangerous
as
it
can
<collocation>lower visibility</collocation>
and
make
driving
very
difficult


when
it
snows
the
snow
will
melt
a
little
during
the
daytime
and
freeze
again
at
night


this
makes
ice
which
can
make
driving
conditions
very
treacherous


snow
plows
are
used
to
remove
snow
from
roads
to
make
driving
easier
and
safer


also
sand
or
salt
may
be
added
to
the
road
to
help
<collocation>tires grip</collocation>
the
road


when
salt
is
mixed
with
snow
the
snow
will
melt
more
easily


this
is
because
salt
water
has
a
lower
melting
point
than
fresh
water
water
without
salt


a
blizzard
is
a
dangerous
type
of
a
snowstorm


a
blizzard
produces
heavy
snow
and
strong
winds
and
can
produce
thunder
snow
which
is
snow
with
lightning
and
thunder


a
a
blizzard
is
like
a
thunderstorm
except
a
blizzard
has
mostly
snow
instead
of
rain
although
in
some
cases
snow
and
rain
can
be
present

power
of

the

of

is
not

as

<collocation>prime minister</collocation>


a
<collocation>prime minister</collocation>
is
part
of
a
parliament
but
a
president
is
not


in
some
countries
such
as
the
united
states
or
france
the
president
has
more
power
and
responsibility
than
anyone
else


in
other
countries
such
as
the
republic
of
ireland
or
israel
to
be
president
is
more
of
an
honor
or
a
symbol
and
the
position
has
no
real
power


the
president
is
often
called
the
nation
chief
executive


as
chief
executive
the
president
must
take
an
active
role
in
all
phases
of
government


most
countries
that
have
a
king
or
queen
as
their
monarch
have
no
president


the
american
president
is
restricted
by
the
written
united
states
constitution
which
can
be
changed
but
only
if
of
congress
as
well
as
the
president
and
of
the
states
agree
to
it


the
american
constitution
was
created
to
make
sure
that
the
american
executive
never
became
as
powerful
as
the
british
system
it
had
broken
away
from


the
british
<collocation>prime minister</collocation>
is
part
of
both
the
legislature
and
executive
whereas
the
american
president
is
the
head
of
the
executive


the
american
governmental
system
shows
a
clear
separation
of
powers
unlike
the
british
system


all
the
president
ministerial
appointments
have
to
be
vetted
by
congress
parliament
and
congress
may
have
an
opposition
majority


the
president
does
not
have
the
ability
to
introduce
and
influence
legislation
in
the
same
way
as
the
british
<collocation>prime minister</collocation>


congress
has
much
greater
control
over
the
budget
and
foreign
policy
than
the
british
parliament


there
are
broad
areas
of
american
life
such
as
education
crime
and
punishment
over
which
the
president
has
virtually
no
influence
at
all


the
president
even
has
very
limited
control
over
the
economy


so
despite
having
a
large
<collocation>nuclear arsenal</collocation>

galileo
galilei
february
january
was
an
italian
astronomer
and
instrument
maker


he
ran
into
conflict
with

day
and
was
put
on
trial
for

by

some
people
believe
that
galileo
was
the
first
person
to
build
a
telescope


this
is
not
true
but
he
was
the
first
person
to
publish
his
observations
through
a
telescope
of
objects
in
the
sky
like
the
moon
stars
and
other
planets


he
discovered
that
the
milky
way
is
made
of
many
stars
that
the
moon
has
hills
and
he
found
four
moons
around
jupiter
now
called
the
<collocation>galilean moons</collocation>


later
scientists
found
many
others


he
also
discovered
sunspots
which
are
dark
areas
of
the
sun


he
saw
that
the
planet
venus
has
light
and
dark
phases
just
like
the
moon


this
helped
people
to
know
that
the
sun
is
at
the
center
of
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
as
copernicus
had
said


physics
galileo
also
studied
natural
forces
and
other
things
that
are
now
called
principles
of
physics


a
legend
says
that
he
climbed
the
<collocation>leaning tower</collocation>
of
pisa
and
dropped
cannonballs
of
different
weights
to
see
which
would
strike
the
ground
first


even
though
their
weights
were
not
the
same
they
hit
the
ground
at
the
same
time


galileo
found
that
objects
fall
to
the
ground
at
the
same
rate
unless
things
like
wind
resistance
change
the
rate


this
went
against
the
views
of
aristotle
an
ancient
philosopher
whose
theory
was
different


galileo
findings
were
ignored
by
most
people
and
aristotle
view
was
still
accepted
as
correct
until
<collocation>isaac newton</collocation>
proved
galileo
was
right


this
also
led
to
newton
creating
his
law
of
gravity


galileo
also
tried
to
determine
the
speed
of
light


he
climbed
a
hill
and
had
an
assistant
climb
another
hill
both
carrying
lanterns
with
closed
shutters


he
then
opened
the
shutter
of
his
lantern


his
assistant
opened
his
own
shutter
when
he
saw
galileo
lantern


galileo
then
measured
the
time
it
took
for
his
assistant
shutter
to
open


knowing
the
time
difference
and
the
distance
between
the
hills
he
tried
to
estimate
the
speed
of
light


however
this
did
not
work


trial
for
heresy
galileo
came
to
accept
the
findings
of
copernicus
that
the
sun
was
the
center
of
the
universe
and
not
the
earth


because
he
promoted
this
and
other
ideas
he
came
to
the
notice
of
the
committee
of
propaganda
the
dreaded
inquisition


the
church
taught
that
the
earth
stood
still
while
everything
in
the
sky
moved
around
it


the
inquisition
ruled
that
other
theories
could
only
be
discussed
as
possibilities
not
facts


galileo
later
defended
his
views
in
his
most
famous
work
dialogue
concerning
the
two
chief
world
systems
published
in


the
book
was
in
the
form
of
conversations
between
three
men


the
man
representing
the
church
point
of
view
was
called


at
this
the
inquisition
took
action


he
was
arrested
and
put
on
trial


they
found
him
vehemently
suspect
of
heresy


they
reminded
him
of
the
fate
of
who
had
been
burnt
at
the
stake
for
heresy


heresy
was
to
believe
the
earth
went
round
the
sun
and
that
there
were
many
other
stars


the
inquisition
forced
galileo
to
recant
say
he
was
wrong
under
the
threat
of
execution
and
to
withdraw
his
works
from
publication


galileo
spent
the
rest
of
his
life
under
<collocation>house arrest</collocation>


in
time
more
and
more
of
galileo
findings
were
accepted
as
true


late
in
the
century
pope
john
paul
ii
called
galileo
the
father
of
modern
physics
and
made
a
public
apology
for
how
the
church
treated
him
earlier

a
handshake
is
often
used
to
mean
there
is
an
agreement


when
people
feel
or
think
the
same
way
about
something
they
agree


sometimes
it
is
important
to
write
down
or
make
a
promise
to
what
has
been
agreed
on


this
is
called
an
agreement


agreements
are
common
in
law
and
business


for
example
when
a
person
takes
out
a
loan
or
hires
someone
to
work
an
agreement
is
usually
signed
so
everyone
understands
what
must
be
done
and
in
what
time
it
must
be
done


when
a
person
agrees
to
do
something
or
to
not
do
something
that
person
is
making
a
promise


a
promise
can
be
made
broken
link
verbal
verbally
by
saying
it
or
it
can
be
written
down
as
a
contract


breaking
a
promise
or
not
keeping
it
is
often
just
bad
manners
but
it
can
sometimes
be
illegal
such
as
when
a
contract
is
not
kept


a
vow
is
a
special
promise


it
is
mostly
used
in
a
religious
sense
or
in
ceremonies
such
as
marriages
when
the
couple
who
are
being
married
make
their
marriage
vows
promising
to
be
faithful
to
one
another


an
oath
is
a
promise
in
the
legal
sense


when
someone
has
to
give
evidence
in
a
court
of
law
they
swear
an
oath


this
means
that
they
promise
they
will
tell
the
truth


clouds
in
the
sky
for
the
computer
science
term
<collocation>cloud computing</collocation>
a
cloud
is
water
in
the
atmosphere
air
that
we
can
see


it
is
where
rain
and
snow
comes
from


water
on
the
earth
evaporates
turns
into
an
invisible
gas
and
rises
up
into
the
sky


higher
up
where
the
air
is
colder
the
water
condenses
it
changes
from
a
gas
to
drops
of
water
or
crystals
of
ice


we
see
these
drops
of
water
as
clouds


the
drops
fall
back
down
to
earth
as
rain
and
then
the
water
evaporates
again


this
is
called
the
water
cycle


the
atmosphere
always
has
a
<collocation>little bit</collocation>
of
water
vapor
that
humans
can
not
see


clouds
form
when
the
atmosphere
can
no
longer
hold
all
the
invisible
air
vapor


page
needed
any
more
water
<collocation>vapor condenses</collocation>
into
very
small
water
drops


that
is
what
a
cloud
is


warm
air
holds
more
water
vapor
than
cool
air


so
if
warm
air
with
lots
of
water
inside
cools
it
can
form
a
cloud


these
are
ways
air
can
cool
enough
to
form
clouds
when
it
is
cooled
by
the
ground
at
night
making
a
fog
along
weather
fronts
where
warmer
air
is
cooled
as
it
runs
into
colder
air
when
air
goes
up
the
side
of
a
mountain
and
cools
as
it
goes
higher
when
warm
air
goes
over
something
colder
such
as
cool
water
in
a
lake


clouds
are
heavy


the
water
in
a
cloud
can
have
a
mass
of
several
million
tons


every
cubic
metre
of
the
cloud
has
only
about
grams
of
water
in
it


<collocation>cloud droplets</collocation>
are
also
about
times
heavier
than
evaporated
water
so
they
are
much
heavier
than
air


they
do
not
fall
but
stay
in
the
air
because
there
is
warm
air
all
round
the
heavier
water
droplets


when
water
changes
from
gas
to
droplets
this
makes
heat


because
the
droplets
are
very
small
they
stick
to
the
warm
air


sometimes
clouds
appear
to
be
brilliant
colors
at
sunrise
or
sunset


this
has
shown
to
be
due
to
pollution
in
the
air

clouds
are
classified
according
to
how
they
look
and
how
high
the
base
of
the
cloud
is
in
the
sky


this
system
was
suggested
in


there
are
different
sorts
of
clouds
because
the
air
where
they
form
can
be
still
or
moving
forward
or
up
and
down
at
different
speeds


very
thick
clouds
with
large
enough
water
droplets
can
make
rain
or
snow
and
the
biggest
clouds
can
make
thunder
and
lightning


there
are
three
basic
types
of
clouds
based
on
how
they
look
<collocation>stratus clouds</collocation>
are
like
flat
sheets


they
may
be
clouds
with

the
name
with

the
name
or
vertical
clouds
that
make
rain
or
snow
with
added

the
name


<collocation>cumulus clouds</collocation>
are
lumpy
or
wavy


they
may
be
clouds
