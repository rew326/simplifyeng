of

is

history
in
richard
stallman
started
the
free
software
movement
when
he
began
the
gnu
project


free
software
and
open
source
free
software
is
very
similar
but
different
from
open
source
software


people
who
like
the
name
free
software
more
say
that
they
like
it
because
they
think
every
human
must
have
the
right
to
use
the
things
that
they
have
how
they
want
learn
how
the
things
that
they
have
work
and
change
them
so
they
are
more
useful
give
or
sell
a
thing
that
they
have
to
a
good
friend
or
neighbor
or
to
friends
and
neighbors
even
if
they
have
many
good
friends
and
neighbors
change
and
fix
correct
the
things
that
they
have
and
help
other
people
to
do
the
same
so
that
they
do
not
need
to
do
it
themselves
in
secret
when
somebody
else
already
did
it
and
can
help


people
who
like
the
name
open
source
more
say
that
they
like
it
because
the
authors
of
such
software
allow
others
to
look
at
the
software
and
change
it
so
the
others
will
then
help
the
authors
make
the
software
better


because
of
how
the
name
open
source
is
used
almost
all
free
software
is
open
source
software
and
almost
all
open
source
software
is
free
software


what
is
needed
use
if
an
author
wants
to
make
his
computer
program
free
he
must
allow
the
people
to
whom
he
gives
the
program
as
a
free
program
to
use
it
for
any
reason
and
purpose
on
any
computer
in
any
place
at
any
time
without
limits


that
does
not
mean
that
the
author
must
say
i
allow
you
to
delete
files
from
the
computers
of
other
people
without
telling
them
but
he
must
not
say
i
prohibit
you
from
deleting
files
from
the
computers
of
other
people
without
telling
them


if
deleting
files
from
somebodies
computer
is
illegal
it
will
be
illegal
even
if
it
is
prohibited
only
by
law
and
not
by
the
author
of
the
program


if
it
is
legal
for
example
if
a
user
wants
the
program
to
delete
his
files
without
telling
him
about
that
but
the
author
has
prohibited
it
nobody
can
change
the
program
to
make
a
useful
program
which
does
that
and
give
it
to
others


the
author
must
not
prohibit
even
things
which
are
dangerous
because
if
the
prohibition
is
not
very
very
very
complex
and
long
it
may
be
used
incorrectly


for
example
explosive
materials
can
be
used
for
war
but
they
can
also
be
used
to
remove
a
big
stone
which
has
fallen
on
a
road


some
authors
would
want
to
prohibit
eating
meat
or
saying
bad
words
or
good
words
which
are
not
allowed
to
be
said
in
their
culture
or
something
else


if
many
authors
prohibit
many
different
things
then
a
program
which
is
made
of
the
programs
of
those
authors
will
not
be
usable


change
a
person
can
understand
how
a
program
works
or
change
the
program
only
if
they
have
the
source
code
of
that
program


it
is
difficult
to
read
and
very
difficult
to
change
many
of
the
programs
which
exist
because
they
are
often
compiled
so
only
a
computer
can
easily
read
them


because
of
that
software
can
be
free
or
open
source
only
if
the
person
who
gets
a
copy
can
ask
for
and
get
the
source
code
without
paying
more
money


if
the
user
has
a
computer
and
is
allowed
to
change
the
program
in
the
computer
the
computer
must
work
with
the
changed
program
if
the
user
has
not
made
a
mistake
while
changing
the
program


the
license
gnu
prohibits
making
computers
which
although
the
user
can
change
the
programs
in
them
completely
stop
working
after
that
only
because
the
program
is
changed


other
there
are
also
other
things
which
must
be
allowed


free
software
and
freeware
the
word
free
in
free
software
is
about
freedom
not
price


people
are
allowed
to
sell
free
software
but
the
person
who
buys
the
software
may
change
it
or
give
it
away


the
name
free
software
in
english
language
is
also
often
used
for
software
a
copy
of
which
people
can
download
without
paying
money
and
sometimes
can
give
copies
to
others
but
not
do
all
the
things
with
it
that
they
can
do
with
the
other
free
software


in
this
case
free
means
free
of
charge
freedom
from
paying
money


this
software
is
called
freeware
it
is
almost
always
proprietary
software

about
being

talent
with
technical
work
however

infantry
regiment
and
then
in

<collocation>mountain battalion</collocation>
of
the


while
serving
with
that
unit
he
gained
a
reputation
for
making
quick
<collocation>tactical decisions</collocation>
and
taking
advantage
of
enemy
confusion


he
was
wounded
three
times
and
awarded
the
iron
cross
first
and
second
class


also
received
prussia
highest
medal
the
pour
le
after
fighting
in
the
mountains
of
west
battles
of

the
award
came
as
a
result
of
the
battle
of
and
the
capture
of
mount
and
its
defenders
numbering
italian
officers
men
and
pieces
of
artillery


his
battalion
used
gas
during

also
played
a
key
role
in
the
victory
of
the
central
powers
over

italian
army
at
the
battle
of


while
fighting
at
was
taken
prisoner
by

he
escaped
and
because
he
spoke

he
was
back

lines
within
two
weeks


later
when
the
german
and
italian
armies
were
allied
during
the
second
<collocation>world war</collocation>
realized
that
their
lack
of
success
in
battle
was
due
to
poor
leadership
and
equipment
which
when
fixed
easily
made
them
equal
to
german
forces


<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii
poland
was
a
commander
of

<collocation>escort headquarters</collocation>
during

defeat
returned
to

to
organize

victory
parade
taking
part
himself
as
a
member
of

entourage


during

was
asked
to
help
of
one
of
his
wife
relatives
a
polish
priest
who
had
been
arrested


when
asked

gestapo
for
information
the
gestapo
found
no
information
about

france
asked
hitler
for
command
of
a
panzer
division


on
february
three
months
before
the
invasion
of

was
given
command
of
the

division
for
fall
<collocation>case yellow</collocation>
the
invasion
of
france
and
the
<collocation>low countries</collocation>


some
other
officers
did
not
agree
with
his
promotion


<collocation>initial request</collocation>
for
command
had
been
rejected
by
the
chief
of
army
personnel
who
cited
his
lack
of
previous
experience
with
armored
units
and
his
extensive
prior
experience
in
an
alpine
unit
made
him
a
more
suitable
candidate
to
assume
command
of
a
mountain
division
that
had
recent
need
to
fill
its
commanding
officer
post


p
had
however
emphasized
the
use
of
<collocation>mobile infantry</collocation>
and
recognized
the
great
usefulness
of
armored
forces
in
the
poland
campaign


he
set
about
learning
and
developing
the
techniques
of
armored
warfare
with
<collocation>great enthusiasm</collocation>


the
decision
to
place
him
in
command
of
an
armored
division
was
borne
out
to
be
an
excellent
one


in
may
his
panzer
division
became
known
as
the
ghost
division
because
its
<collocation>rapid advances</collocation>
and
fast
paced
attacks
often
placed
them
so
far
forward
that
they
were
frequently
out
of
communication
with
the
rest
of
the
german
army


north
africa
reward
for
his
success
was
to
be
promoted
and
appointed
commander
of
the
light
division
later
and
and
of
the
which
as

italian
troops
which
had

heavy
defeat
from

commonwealth
forces
in
operation
compass


it
was
in
africa
where
achieved
his
greatest
fame
as
a
commander


attitude
grave
was
well
known
not
only
by
the
german
people
but
also
by
his
enemies


stories
of
his
chivalry
and
<collocation>tactical ability</collocation>
earned
him
the
respect
of
many
