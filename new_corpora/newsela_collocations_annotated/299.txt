only
one
player
can
bat
at
a
time


the
baseball
field
or
diamond
has
two
main
parts
the
infield
and
the
outfield


the
infield
is
where
the
four
bases
are


the
outfield
is
beyond
the
bases
from
the
view
of
home
plate


the
lines
from
home
plate
to
first
base
and
home
plate
to
third
base
are
the
foul
lines
and
the
ground
outside
of
these
lines
is
called
foul
territory


a
ball
that
is
hit
with
a
bat
and
flies
between
the
foul
lines
is
a
fair
ball
and
the
batter
and
runners
can
try
and
run
around
the
bases
and
score


a
ball
that
is
outside
the
foul
lines
is
a
foul
ball


if
the
ball
hits
the
ground
in
the
foul
area
rather
than
being
caught
in
the
air
the
batter
continues
to
bat
and
any
runners
must
return
to
their
base


if
the
batter
has
fewer
than
two
strikes
a
foul
ball
counts
as
a
strike


if
a
ball
is
caught
by
a
fielder
in
fair
or
foul
ground
the
batter
is
out


a
batter
swinging
at
a
pitched
ball


the
most
important
part
of
the
game
is
between
the
pitcher
and
the
batter


the
pitcher
throws
or
pitches
the
ball
towards
home
plate


the
pitcher
normally
throws
the
ball
close
enough
for
the
batter
to
hit
it


if
the
pitcher
throws
the
ball
over
home
plate
and
between
the
hitter
knee
and
chest
the
pitch
is
a
strike
unless
the
batter
hits
the
ball


the
pitch
is
always
a
strike
regardless
of
where
it
is
if
the
<collocation>batter swings</collocation>
the
bat
and
misses
so
the
batter
must
have
good
aim
with
the
bat


three
strikes
are
a
strikeout
and
this
is
one
way
to
make
an
out


a
pitch
that
the
batter
does
not
swing
at
and
which
is
not
called
a
strike
is
a
ball


on
the
fourth
ball
thrown
by
a
pitcher
the
batter
walks
to
first
base
so
it
is
important
to
pitch
well


the
catcher
for
the
pitcher
team
waits
behind
the
batter
and
catches
any
ball
that
the
batter
does
not
hit


the
catcher
uses
signals
to
tell
the
pitcher
where
to
throw
the
ball


if
the
pitcher
does
not
like
what
the
catcher
says
he
will
shake
his
head
which
signals
no


if
he
agrees
with
what
the
catcher
has
signaled
he
will
nod
his
head
which
signals
yes


there
are
many
ways
to
get
batters
out
and
runners
can
also
be
gotten
out


some
common
ways
to
get
batters
out
are
catching
a
batted
ball
in
the
air
whether
in
fair
or
foul
territory
throwing
the
ball
to
the
defensive
player
at
first
base
an
out
if
it
gets
there
before
the
batter
and
a
strikeout


a
runner
can
be
put
out
by
tagging
the
runner
while
the
runner
is
not
on
a
base
and
by
forcing
him
out
when
a
base
is
touched
before
a
player
can
get
there
with
no
base
for
the
runner
to
go
back
to


when
the
<collocation>fielding team</collocation>
has
put
out
three
of
the
batting
team
players
the
is
over
and
the
team
in
the
field
and
the
team
at
<collocation>bat switch</collocation>
places


the
batting
team
wants
to
get
runs


in
order
to
get
a
run
a
player
must
bat
then
become
a
base
runner
touch
all
the
bases
in
order
and
then
touch
home
plate
without
being
called
out


so
first
the
batter
wants
to
make
other
players
get
to
home
plate
or
to
run
the
bases
himself


runners
can
not
pass
each
other
while
running
the
bases


a
base
runner
who
touches
home
plate
after
touching
all
previous
bases
in
order
and
without
getting
out
scores
a
run


if
the
batter
hits
the
ball
over
the
fence
between
the
foul
lines
without
touching
the
ground
it
is
a
home
run


the
batter
and
any
are
allowed
to
advance
to
the
home
plate
and
score
a
run


the
<collocation>fielding team</collocation>
can
do
nothing
to
stop
them


<collocation>fielding team</collocation>
the
team
in
the
field
tries
not
to
let
the
team
at
bat
get
any
runs


the
<collocation>fielding team</collocation>
has
a
pitcher
and
a
catcher


the
remaining
seven
fielders
may
stand
anywhere
in
the
field


however
there
are
usually
four
people
that
stand
around
the
infield
close
to
the
bases
and
three
outfielders
who
stand
around
the
outfield


the
four
infielders
are
the
first
baseman
second
baseman
shortstop
and
third
baseman


the
first
baseman
and
third
baseman
stand
close
to
first
base
and
third
base


the
second
baseman
and
the
shortstop
stand
on
either
side
of
second
base


the
first
baseman
job
is
to
make
force
plays
at
first
base


in
a
force
play
another
infielder
catches
a
ball
that
has
touched
the
ground
and
throws
it
to
the
first
baseman


the
first
baseman
must
then
touch
the
batter
or
the
base
with
the
ball
before
the
batter
can
touch
first
base


then
the
batter
is
out


first
need
to
have
quick
feet
stretch
well
be
quick
and
know
how
to
catch
wild
throws


first
base
is
one
of
the
most
important
positions
as
a
significant
number
of
plays
happen
there


the
second
baseman
job
is
to
cover
the
area
to
the
right
of
second
base
and
to
back
the
first
baseman
up


the
shortstop
job
is
to
cover
the
area
between
second
and
third
bases


this
is
where
batters
usually
hit
ground
balls


the
shortstop
also
covers
second
or
third
base
and
the
near
part
of
left
field


the
shortstop
is
usually
the
best
fielder
on
the
team


the
third
baseman
needs
to
have
a
strong
throwing
arm


this
is
because
many
times
the
batter
will
hit
a
ball
toward
third
base


the
third
baseman
must
throw
the
ball
very
quickly
to
the
first
baseman
to
get
the
runner
out


because
the
balls
that
go
to
third
base
are
usually
hit
very
hard
the
third
baseman
must
also
be
very
quick


the
three
outfielders
are
called
the
left
fielder
the
center
fielder
and
the
right
fielder
because
they
stand
in
left
field
center
field
and
right
field


left
field
and
right
field
are
on
the
left
and
right
sides
if
you
look
out
from
home
plate


center
field
is
straight
ahead
from
home
plate


center
field
is
very
big
so
the
center
fielder
is
usually
the
fastest


the
team
can
decide
where
to
put
the
infielders
and
outfielders


players
often
stand
at
slightly
different
places
on
the
field
between
some
plays


these
changes
are
called
shifts


the
fielders
may
shift
at
any
time


players
can
shift
for
many
reasons


one
of
the
more
popular
ones
is
the
defensive
shift
where
players
move
in
the
infield


they
do
this
because
they
know
that
some
batters
can
only
hit
a
ball
a
certain
direction


it
can
also
be
easier
to
make
a
double
play
when
fielders
are
moved
a
certain
way


pitching
how
the
pitcher
moves


teams
can
change
pitchers
during
a
game


teams
change
their
pitchers
often
because
it
is
hard
for
a
pitcher
to
throw
a
full
game
of
nine
innings


a
pitcher
can
sometimes
throw
a
where
no
one
on
the
opposite
team
gets
an
earned
hit


a
team
can
use
as
many
pitchers
as
it
wants
to
but
it
is
rare
to
use
more
than
eight
in
a
game


the
ways
that
a
pitcher
throws
the
ball
are
called
pitches


many
professional
pitchers
use
two
or
more
different
pitches


pitchers
change
which
pitch
they
throw
so
that
the
batter
will
be
tricked
and
not
know
what
pitch
to
expect


this
makes
it
more
difficult
for
the
batter
to
hit
the
ball


pitchers
can
make
the
ball
move
differently
faster
or
slower
closer
or
farther
from
the
batter
higher
or
lower


there
are
many
types
of
pitches
such
as
the
curve
slider
splitter
sinker
screw
cut
screw
knuckle
knuckle
curve
circle
palm
ball
and
others


when
throwing
the
ball
the
pitcher
must
touch
the
pitcher
rubber
with
his
foot


the
pitcher
rubber
is
on
top
of
the
mound


the
pitcher
can
not
take
more
than
one
step
forward
when
he
throws
the
ball


that
makes
the
pitcher
throw
the
ball
slower


many
pitchers
can
throw
the
ball
up
to
miles
per
hour


throwing
a
baseball
that
fast
can
be
bad
for
the
body


pitchers
can
end
up
with
a
lot
of
injuries


the
batting
team
the
batting
team
wants
to
get
runs


the
batting
team
sends
its
players
up
to
home
plate
in
a
special
order


this
order
is
called
the
lineup


each
team
chooses
its
lineup
at
the
start
of
the
game


after
the
game
starts
the
team
can
not
change
the
order


but
the
team
can
use
a
player
who
was
not
on
the
lineup


the
new
player
has
to
change
with
an
original
player


the
new
player
name
is
written
in
the
lineup
where
the
original
player
name
was


after
the
ninth
player
has
batted
the
first
player
in
the
lineup
starts
again


if
a
runner
comes
to
home
plate
he
scores
a
run


then
he
is
not
a
base
runner


after
scoring
a
run
the
player
must
leave
the
field
until
it
is
his
turn
again


so
a
player
can
only
score
one
run
for
each
time
he
bats


since
people
began
to
have
more
free
time
baseball
has
become
the
<collocation>national pastime</collocation>
of
america


about
million
people
play

birmingham

these
included
making
weapons
