engineer


he
did
not
invent
the

he
did
modify
it
to
work
better

his
major
contribution
is
in
developing

the

is
credited
for
driving

james
watt
was
born
on
january
in
a
seaport
on
the
firth
of


his
father
was
a
ship
owner
and
contractor
and
served
as
the
town
chief
while
his
mother
came
from
a
distinguished
family
and
was
well
educated


both
were
presbyterians
and
strong


watt
grandfather
thomas
watt
taught
mathematics
and
was
a
to
the
baron
of


watt
did
not
go
to
school
every
day


at
first
he
was
mostly
schooled
at
home
by
his
mother
but
later
he
attended
grammar
school


he
exhibited
great
manual
dexterity
and
an
aptitude
for
mathematics
although
latin
and
greek
failed
to
interest
him
and
he
absorbed
the
legends
and
lore
of
the
scottish
people


the
<collocation>centrifugal governor</collocation>
<collocation>centrifugal governor</collocation>
in
a
watt
engine
of
drawing
of
a
centrifugal
governor
one
of
watt
many
improvements
was
the
invention
of
a
<collocation>centrifugal governor</collocation>
to
regulate
automatically
the
speed
of
the
engine


this
is
most
obvious
on
<collocation>steam engines</collocation>
where
it
regulates
the
admission
of
steam
into
the
cylinder


it
is
also
found
on
internal
<collocation>combustion engines</collocation>
and
variously
fueled
turbines
and
in
some
modern
<collocation>striking clocks</collocation>


a
<collocation>centrifugal governor</collocation>
is
a
device
which
controls
the
speed
of
an
engine
by
regulating
the
amount
of
intermediate
substance
steam
which
drives
the
machine


this
keeps
a
near
constant
speed
whatever
the
load
or
fuel
supply
conditions


it
uses
the
principle
of
proportional
control
this
means
the
of
in
this
case
steam
varies
according
to
the
speed
of
the
machine


on
watt
device
as
the
machine
speeds
up
the
balls
fly
round
faster


as
they
fly
round
faster
they
move
out
from
the
central
post


as
they
move
out
from
the
central
post
they
close
the
steam
supply
more
firmly


as
they
do
so
the
machine
slows
down
and
the
balls
spin
more
slowly
and
allow
more
steam
into
the
cylinders


in
addition
the
system
has
a
safety
release
valve
to
allow
<collocation>excess steam</collocation>
to
escape
without
driving
the
wheels


watt
engines
were
built
by
the
firm
between
and


later
in
showed
that
all
regulating
systems
must
balance
two
opposing
forces


partnership
watt
went
into
partnership
with
a
fellow
member
of
the
<collocation>midlands lunar</collocation>
society
matthew


the
firm
of
watt
designed
and
built
<collocation>steam engines</collocation>
and
was
very
important
to
the
industrial
revolution


the
soho
foundry
at
first
the
partnership
made
the
drawing
and
specifications
for
the
engines
and
supervised
the
work
to
erect
it
on
the
customers
property


they
produced
almost
none
of
the
parts
themselves


watt
did
most
of
his
work
at
his
home
in
harper
hill
in
birmingham
while
worked
at
the
soho


gradually
the
partners
began
to
actually
make
more
and
more
of
the
parts
and
by
they
purchased
a
property
about
a
mile
away
from
the
soho
on
the
banks
of
the
birmingham
canal


there
they
built
a
new
foundry
for
making
the
engines


the
soho
foundry
opened
in
at
a
time
when
watt
sons
gregory
and
james
were
heavily
involved
in
the
management
of
the
enterprise


in
the
year
of
watt
retirement
the
firm
made
a
total
of
engines


watt
retired
in
the
same
year
that
his
fundamental
patent
and
partnership
with
expired


the
famous
partnership
was
transferred
to
the
men
sons
matthew
robinson
and
james
watt


longtime

william
was
soon
made

a
lot
is
known
about

life
because
he

many
letters
poems
and
journals


because

so
famous

first
artist

artist
of
the
renaissance

was
sometimes
called
il
the
divine
one


other
artists
said
that
he
had
his
works
were
so
grand
and
full
of
strong
emotion
that
they
were
scary


many
other
artists
who
saw
his
work
tried
to
have
the
same
emotional
quality


from
this
idea
of
came
a
style
of
art
called
mannerism

his
mother
was
di
del
di

a
banking
family
from

they
claimed
they
were
descended
from
the
noble
countess
matilda
of


michelangelo
father
had
lost
most
of
the
bank
money
so
he
worked
for
the
local
government
in
the
town
of


when
michelangelo
was
a
baby
the
family
moved
back
to
florence


because
he
was
sickly
michelangelo
was
sent
to
live
on
a
small
farm
with
a
stonecutter
and
his
wife
and
family


the
stonecutter
worked
at
a
marble
quarry
owned
by
michelangelo
father


many
years
later
michelangelo
said
that
the
two
things
that
had
helped
him
to
be
a
good
artist
were
being
born
in
the
<collocation>gentle countryside</collocation>
of
and
being
raised
in
a
house
where
along
with
his
nurse
milk
he
was
given
the
training
to
use
a
chisel
and
hammer


his
mother
died
when
he
was
only
seven


michelangelo
father
then
brought
him
back
to
florence
and
sent
him
to
study
with
a
tutor
da


michelangelo
was
not
interested
in
his
school
lessons


he
explored
the
great
churches
of
the
city
and
drew
copies
of
the
frescos
that
he
saw
there


when
he
was
thirteen
he
was
apprenticed
to
the
painter


had
a
large
busy
studio


he
had
rich
patrons
who
worked
for
the


he
painted
frescos
in
their
family
chapels


michelangelo
was
able
to
learn
the
art
of
fresco
painting
very
well
from


in
a
large
workshop
such
as
artists
would
have
been
working
in
all
sorts
of
different
media
including
sculpture
metalwork
and
painting


michelangelo
would
have
learned
about
all
these
things


when
michelangelo
was
only
fourteen
his
father
persuaded
to
pay
his
apprentice
as
an
artist
which
was
highly
unusual
at
the
time


working
for
the
the
richest
most
powerful
family
in
florence
were
the


they
had
an
academy
where
some
of
the
most
famous
philosophers
poets
and
artists
met
to
share
their
ideas


the
family
were
important
patrons
of
the
arts


in
de
the
head
of
the
family
asked
to
send
his
two
best
pupils
to
the
academy


michelangelo
was
one
of
the
students
chosen
and
he
attended
the
academy
from
to


he
heard
the
teaching
and
discussion
of
pico
della
and


the
philosophy
that
they
taught
was
called
humanism


it
was
based
on
the
philosophy
of
the
ancient
greek
plato


michelangelo
ideas
and
his
art
were
influenced
by
these
teachings


the
madonna
of
the
stairs
was
made
while
michelangelo
was
in
his
teens


michelangelo
and
another
young
sculptor
called
studied
sculpture
under
di


michelangelo
had
an
argument
with
who
punched
him
on
the
nose
so
that
it
was
badly
broken
and
spoilt
his
appearance
for
the
rest
of
his
life


michelangelo
sculpted
some
reliefs
flat
panels
with
raised
figures
on
them


one
was
the
battle
of
the
centaurs
which
was
made
for
de


in
michelangelo
patron
de
died


this
brought
about
a
big
change
in
michelangelo
life


he
went
back
to
live
at
his
father
house


michelangelo
asked
the
prior
at
the
church
of
to
allow
him
to
study
the
anatomy
of
the
bodies
of
people
who
had
died
at
the
church
hospital


in
as
a
gift
to
the
prior
michelangelo
carved
a
large
wooden
crucifix
which
still
hangs
in
the
church


in
january
there
were
very
<collocation>heavy snowfalls</collocation>


de
son
de
commissioned
michelangelo
to
make
a
snow
statue


so
michelangelo
began
to
work
for
the
again


in
a
new
leader
rose
up
in
florence


he
was
a
dominican
friar
called


his
strong
preaching
caused
people
to
burn
their
books
throw
away
their
jewellery
and
chase
the
rich
families
out
of
the
city


the
had
to
go


for
michelangelo
it
was
a
good
time
to
travel


he
stayed
for
a
while
in
venice
then
moved
to
bologna


in
bologna
he
soon
got
work
sculpting
three
figures
for
the
big
<collocation>marble shrine</collocation>
of
saint


when
things
calmed
down
in
florence
michelangelo
returned
and
worked
for
another
member
of
the
family
di
de


michelangelo
made
a
marble
statue
of
cupid
asleep


di
told
michelangelo
that
it
looked
just
like
a
real
ancient
roman
statue
and
said
that
if
he
made
it
dirty
and
knocked
a
few
chips
off
someone
would
pay
a
lot
of
money
for
it


sold
it
to
a
cardinal
who
discovered
that
it
was
a
fraud


he
thought
that
michelangelo
work
was
so
good
that
he
told
the
pope
about
it


the
pope
then
invited
michelangelo
to
go
to
rome
and
work
for
him


rome
the
pieta
shows
the
virgin
mary
with
the
body
of
jesus
in
her
lap
after
the
crucifixion


michelangelo
arrived
in
rome
june
at
the
age
of


he
lived
near
the
church
of
santa
maria
di
on
the
hill


in
he
got
an
important
commission
he
was
given
a
paid
job
from
cardinal


the
cardinal
wanted
michelangelo
to
make
a
marble
statue
larger
than
of
bacchus
the
ancient
roman
god
of
wine


michelangelo
worked
hard
at
the
statue


he
carved
bacchus
as
a
young
man
who
was
quite
drunk
and
looked
as
if
he
was
staggering
as
he
raised
his
cup
to
make
a
toast


the
cardinal
did
not
like
the
drunken
bacchus
and
would
not
pay
for
it


a
banker
called
bought
it
for
his
garden


michelangelo
next
important
commission
was
from
the
french
ambassador
who
asked
him
to
make
a
statue
of
the
virgin
mary
mourning
over
the
dead
body
of
her
son
jesus


this
type
of
artwork
either
a
painting
or
a
statue
is
called
by
the
italian
name
pieta
say


michelangelo
pieta
is
the
most
famous
pieta
that
has
ever
been
made


it
is
now
in
saint
peter
basilica
and
is
visited
by
thousands
of
people
every

wrote
it
is
a
miracle
that
a

block
of
stone
could
have
been
carved

perfect

still
struggles
to
see
the
statue
that
he
made


sistine
<collocation>chapel ceiling</collocation>
main
sistine
chapel
michelangelo
painted
the
ceiling
of
the
sistine
chapel


the
work
took
nearly
four
years
to
complete
in
michelangelo
was
invited
to
rome
by
the
newly
elected
pope
julius
ii


pope
julius
was
an
old
man


he
wanted
michelangelo
to
design
a
grand
tomb


it
was
to
stand
inside
a
church
and
have
many
carved
figures
which
were
to
include
several
slaves
to
hold
up
part
of
the
tomb
and
<collocation>old testament</collocation>
prophets
to
sit
in
openings
in
the
walls


michelangelo
started
work


he
made
a
<collocation>magnificent statue</collocation>
of
moses
which
is
now
in
the
church
of
in
st
peter
in
chains
in
rome


many
people
go
to
look
at
this
statue


the
slaves
were
only
partly
carved


four
of
them
are
now
in
the
accademia
in
florence


the
rest
of
the
great
plan
was
unfinished


the
main
reason
that
pope
julius
tomb
was
not
finished
was
that
the
pope
had
an
idea
for
another
artwork


the
sistine
chapel
near
peter
basilica
had
its
walls
painted
by
some
famous
artists
from
florence


the
pope
decided
that
michelangelo
should
paint
the
ceiling


michelangelo
did
not
want
to


he
said
that
he
was
not
a
painter


but
the
pope
bullied
michelangelo
until
he
agreed
to
do
it


he
told
the
pope
that
he
would
do
it
for
god
and
that
he
would
only
do
it
if
the
pope
let
him
paint
it
in
his
own
way


the
chapel
was
long
and
wide
