as
soon
as
they
ripen
the
pods
are
removed
with
a
curved
knife
on
a
long
pole
opened
with
a
machete
and
left
to
dry
until
taken
to
fermentation


then
the
beans
are
removed
and
piled
in
heaps
bins
or
on
grates
where
during
several
days
of
sweating
the
thick
pulp
ferments
until
it
thins
and
trickles
off


the
quality
of
the
beans
which
originally
have
a
strong
<collocation>bitter taste</collocation>
depends
upon
this
sweating


if
it
is
overdone
they
may
be
ruined
if
underdone
they
have
a
flavor
like
raw
potatoes
and
are
susceptible
to
mildew


then
the
beans
are
spread
out
constantly
raked
over
and
dried


on
large
plantations
this
is
done
on
<collocation>huge trays</collocation>
either
outdoors
by
sunshine
or
in
sheds
by
artificial
heat


however
thousands
of
tons
from
smaller
producers
are
dried
on
small
trays
or
on


finally
the
beans
are
trodden
and
shuffled
about
often
using
bare
human
feet
and
sometimes
during
this
process
red
clay
mixed
with
water
is
sprinkled
over
the
beans

about

country
followed

uses
of
cocoa
are
numerous


it
may
be
used
in
cakes
creams
drinks
toppings


besides
its
use
as
a
food
by
use
of
the
scientific
process
it
has
been
determined
that
cocoa
is
beneficial
for
health


cocoa
has
nearly
twice
the
antioxidants
of
red
wine
and
up
to
three
times
those
found
in
green
tea


problems
with
growth
and
sale
many
cocoa
farmers
get
a
low
price
for
their
products


this
has
led
to
cocoa
and
chocolate
being
available
as
fair
trade
items
in
some
countries
but
this
fair
trade
remains
a
minority
percentage
of
total
trade


slavery
has
commonly
been
used
in

production

the

paradox
is
an
idea
in
philosophy


this
idea
is
explained
here
if

do
anything
may
this
mean
he
is
able
to
make
a
mountain
more
heavy
than
he
is
able
to
lift


people
say
this
question
is
a
paradox
because
if
god
is
able
to
make
a
mountain
more
heavy
than
he
is
able
to
lift
then
there
may
be
something
he
is
not
able
to
do
he
is
not
able
to
lift
that
mountain


if
god
is
not
able
to
make
such
a
mountain
then
there
is
something
he
is
not
able
do
he
is
not
able
to
make
that
mountain


if
either
outcome
were
considered
true
then
it
is
argued
that
god
almighty
is
actually
not
almighty

the
god
paradox
is
a
good
example
of
a
philosophical
problem


this
section
has
some
answers
to
this
paradox


god
can
not
this
answer
says
god
is
able
to
do
only
things
less
than
god


if
you
say
there
exists
a
mountain
that
is
more
heavy
than
anybody
is
able
to
lift
then
what
you
say
is
funny
it
means
nothing
because
god
is
able
to
lift
any
mountain


this
is
because
saying
a
mountain
is
too
heavy
to
lift
means
this
mountain
can
not
be
lifted
by
anybody


this
does
not
mean
that
god
is
too
weak
to
lift
very
heavy
mountains


god
can
not
lift
an
mountain
because
that
would
not
make
sense


he
also
can
not
create
an
mountain
because
that
also
would
not
make
sense
if
god
can
lift
everything


god
could
still
lift
any
mountain
that
is
not
defined
as
can
not
be
lifted


for
example
god
can
make
a
mountain
as
heavy
as
he
wants
but
he
can
not
make
a
round
square


god
can
some
people
think
yes
god
is
able
to
do
things
that
make
him
not
able


they
think
god
is
able
to
do
things
that
are
funny
to
think
because
they
say
there
is
nothing
god
is
not
able
to
do


see
gospel
of
matthew
god
is
infinite
god
is
beyond
limitation


his
strength
is
infinite


if
he
chooses
to
create
a
mountain
that
is
too
heavy
for
him
to
lift
he
would
simultaneously
become
strong
enough
to
lift
it


to
ask
if
the
creation
of
such
a
mountain
is
possible
is
to
attempt
putting
a
limitation
on
the
limitless


logic
in
logic
problems
can
often
be
solved
by
breaking
them
into
smaller
pieces


one
solves
each
of
the
small
problems


let
us
see
how
one
can
use
this
for
the
god
paradox


the
paradox
is
if
god
can
do
anything
can
he
make
a
mountain
which
is
too
heavy
for
him
to
lift


if
one
changes
this
question
to
a
sentence
it
becomes
god
can
do
anything
which
means
that
he
can
make
a
mountain
which
is
too
heavy
for
him
to
lift


we
can
make
this
even
more
simple


first
we
must
see
that
because
god
can
do
anything
he
can
make
an
mountain
he
can
lift
anything


now
we
can
write
the
sentence
as
these
facts
god
can
do
anything


god
can
make
an
mountain
because
of
fact


god
can
lift
anything
because
of
fact


god
can
not
lift
the
mountain


facts
and
must
always
be
true


now
we
must
see
if
fact
is
true
or
false
if
is
true
then
must
be
false
fact
must
also
be
false

libertarianism
to
refer
to
<collocation>libertarian socialism</collocation>
see
anarchism
libertarianism
is
an
idea
in
ethics
and
politics


the
word
comes
from
the
word
liberty


simply
put
libertarians
believe
that
people
should
be
able
to
do
whatever
they
desire
as
long
as
their
actions
do
not
harm
others


as
a
result
libertarians
want
to
limit
the
government
power
so
people
can
have
as
much
freedom
as
possible


libertarianism
grew
out
of
liberalism
as
a
movement
in
the


many
of
the
beliefs
of
libertarianism
are
similar
to
the
beliefs
in
<collocation>classical liberalism</collocation>


it
also
has
roots
in
anarchism
and
the
austrian
school
of

oppose

all
other

rights
libertarians
believe
that
no
person
can
justly
own
or
control
the
body
of
another
person
what
they
call
or
individual
sovereignty


in
simple
words
every
person
has
a
right
to
control
her
or
his
own
body


in
the
century
united
states
libertarians
like
william
garrison
frederick
and
spooner
were
all
abolitionists


abolitionists
were
people
who
wanted
to
end
slavery
right
away


garrison
based
his
opposition
to
slavery
on
the
idea
of


since
you
have
a
natural
right
to
control
your
own
body
no
one
else
has
any
right
to
steal
that
control
from
you


garrison
and
both
called
<collocation>slave masters</collocation>
<collocation>man stealers</collocation>


stopping
violence
if
you
have
a
right
to
control
your
own
body
then
no
one
has
a
right
to
start
violence
or
force
against
you


some
libertarians
believe
that
all
violence
is
unjust


these
libertarians
are
often
called


robert
was
a
libertarian
who
rejected
all
violence


however
most
libertarians
believe
that
there
are
some
ways
violence
can
be
justified


one
thing
that
justifies
violence
is
self
defense


if
someone
is
violent
towards
you
you
have
a
right
to
defend
yourself
with
equal
force


the
libertarian
murray
said
that
it
would
be
wrong
to
kill
someone
for
stealing
a
pack
of
gum


if
you
steal
gum
this
is
an
act
of
violence
against
the
property
owner


the
owner
has
a
right
to
use
defensive
violence
to
get
the
gum
back
but
killing
the
thief
goes
too
far


that
is
too
much
force
because
it
is
not
equal
to
the
force
used
by
the
thief


punishment
must
be
equal
to
the
crime


a
student
and
colleague
of
his
walter
block
said
that
a
punishment
should
be
equal
to
the
crime
but
rather
enough
to
make
up
for
the
damage
the
crime
caused
plus
how
much
it
cost
to
catch
the
criminal


some
libertarians
believe
that
it
is
your
moral
duty
to
defend
yourself
and
your
property
if
you
can


this
belief
is
usually
held
by


these
people
believe
that
pacifism
is
immoral


most
libertarians
reject
this
view


all
libertarians
believe
that
it
is
wrong
to
start
violence
against
any
person
or
against
what
he
or
she
owns


they
call
this
the
principle


property
ownership
is
the
right
to
control
something


property
is
the
thing
that
you
control


libertarians
believe
that
property
rights
come
from


this
means
that
because
you
have
a
right
to
control
your
own
body
you
also
have
a
right
to
control
what
you
make
with
it


the
english
philosopher
john
said
that
a
person
comes
to
own
something
by
using
it


so
if
you
turn
an
area
that
else
owns
into
a
farm
and
use
it
that
area
becomes
your
property


this
is
called
the
<collocation>homestead principle</collocation>


libertarians
also
say
that
you
can
become
a
legitimate
owner
by
receiving
something
as
a
gift
or
by
trading
it
with
someone
for
something
they
own


you
do
not
become
a
legitimate
owner
by
stealing


you
also
do
not
become
a
legitimate
owner
by
simply
saying
you
own
something


if
you
have
not
homesteaded
the
thing
or
received
it
through
trade
or
gift
you
do
not
own
it


government
libertarians
are
opposed
to
states
or
governments
creating
any
laws
that
tell
people
what
they
can
and
can
not
do
with
their
own
bodies


the
only
legitimate
laws
are
laws
that
say
a
person
may
not
start
violence
against
other
people
or
their
legitimate
property


all
laws
stopping
people
from
doing
nonviolent
things
should
be
repealed
according
to
libertarians


these
laws
are
usually
called
<collocation>victimless crimes</collocation>
because
there
is
no
victim
if
there
is
no
theft


in
most
countries
the
state
or
government
takes
tax
money
from
the
people


all
libertarians
support
cutting
taxes
back
and
some
libertarians
believe
the
state
should
not
take
tax
money
at
all


libertarians
think
people
can
take
care
of
the
poor
without
the
government


they
believe
that
people
should
pay
for
the
things
that
they
want
to
use
but
not
have
to
pay
for
other
things
that
they
do
not
want


tax
evasion
refusal
to
pay
taxes
to
the
state
is
a
<collocation>victimless crime</collocation>


libertarians
would
prefer
to
see
taxation
replaced
with
user
fees
and
endowments


libertarians
think
everyone
should
be
allowed
to
decide
what
is
good
or
bad
for
own
body


libertarians
think
if
people
want
to
drive
cars
without
wearing
<collocation>seat belts</collocation>
it
is
their
own
choice


they
should
not
be
forcibly
stopped
from
doing
that
not
even
by
the
state


if
a
person
wants
to
donate
all
of
money
to
a
charity
or
waste
it
all
gambling
that
is
also
something
should
decide
for


no
one
should
be
forcibly
stopped
from
doing
that
not
even
by
the
state


libertarians
even
say
that
if
adults
want
to
use
harmful
drugs
they
should
be
allowed
to
do
that
even
if
it
spoils
their
lives


it
is
the
drug
user
own
choice
because
it
is
the
drug
user
own
body


as
long
as
the
drug
user
does
not
start
using
violence
against
other
people
or
their
legitimate
property
no
one
should
use
violence
against
the
drug
user
or
the
drug
user
legitimate
property
not
even
the
government


many
libertarians
also
believe
that
families
and
friends
should
look
after
people
so
that
they
will
not
use
drugs
drive
without
<collocation>seat belts</collocation>
or
do
other
things
that
are
dangerous
for
them


but
no
one
can
force
others
to
do
things
that
they
do
not
want
to
do
or
to
stop
them
from
doing
nonviolent
things
that
they
want
to
do


types
of
libertarians
there
are
two
basic
types
of
libertarians


all
libertarians
fall
into
one
of
these
two
broad
types


are
libertarians
who
believe
that
society
should
have
a
state
with
very
limited
power


they
typically
believe
that
the
only
things
the
state
should
have
are
police
and
judges
