them
through

another
tradition

this
one
and

result
is
the
tradition
of
<collocation>santa claus</collocation>
or
father
christmas
as
he
is
sometimes
called
and
who
is
nowadays
thought
by
many
children
to
be
the
bringer
of
presents
and
happiness


in
the
century
in
a
greek
village
that
is
now
part
of
turkey
there
was
a
good
man
who
would
secretly
given
presents
to
the

are
not
big

sometimes
hidden
or

a
<collocation>funny joke</collocation>
or
poem
that

be
read

many
towns
of
europe
a
man
dressed
in
bishop
robes
comes
on
a
horse
or
in
a
boat
acting
as
nicholas


his
name
was
often
shortened

claus
or
<collocation>santa claus</collocation>
in

in
spain
it
is
the
three
<collocation>wise men</collocation>
who

in
english
speaking
countries
where

are
usually
given
on
christmas
day
not
december
<collocation>santa claus</collocation>
or
father
christmas
is
usually
thought
of
as
coming
on
christmas
night
when
his
magic
sleigh
is
pulled
across
the
sky
by
reindeer
and
he
comes
into
houses
through
the
chimney


while
in
europe
children
put
out
their
shoes
for
nicholas
the
english
tradition
is
to
hang
up
stockings
or
long
socks
in
front
of
the
fireplace


<collocation>santa claus</collocation>
would
traditionally
fill
the
socks
or
shoes
with
nuts
raisins
chocolates
and
an
orange


nowadays

usually
get
much
more
expensive
presents
and
hang
up
pillow
cases
or
have
the
presents
in
a
big
pile
under
the
christmas
tree


another
christmas
tradition
is
the
sending
of
cards
to
friends
and
relatives


these
contain
<collocation>warm greetings</collocation>
and

also
have

sometimes
an
adjective
is
not
followed
by
a
noun
the
sky
is
blue


the
joke
she
told
was
so
funny
i
could
not
stop
laughing
all
day


he
went
crazy


it
still
an
adjective
because
we
could
have
the
blue
sky
the
<collocation>funny joke</collocation>
and
the
crazy
man


the
adjective
is
still
describing
the
noun
though
they
are
not
side
by
side


an
adjective
is
a
word
that
gives
instant
information
about
a
noun
to
make
a
clear
picture
of
the
noun
in
the
mind
of
the
reader
and
create
a
feeling
of
the
writer

comparative
and

nouns
as
noun
adjectives
and
adverbs
adjectives
used
in
basic
english
comparative
and
superlative
sometimes
there
are
different
forms
of
the
same
adjective


if
one
joke
makes
a
person
laugh
more
than
another
joke
then
that
joke
is
funnier


this
is
called
the
comparative
form
of
the
adjective


the
day
that
is
colder
than
any
other
is
the
coldest
day


this
is
the
superlative
form
of
cold


some
adjectives
need
additional
words
when
we
want
to
compare
them


for
instance
one
car
may
be
cheaper
than
another
but
the
second
car
may
be
more
reliable


we
use
more
reliable
instead
of


reliable
means
worthy
of
trust


the
rule
is
for
short
adjectives
ending
in
a
consonant
like
cold
black
or
fast
one
adds
the
suffix
er
to
make
a
comparison
of
greater
magnitude


example
the
north
pole
is
colder
than
florida


the
greatest
possible
comparison
is
made
by
adding
the
suffix
est


example
the
north
pole
is
the
coldest
place
on
the
earth


for
long
adjectives
like
intelligent
conscientious
comprehensive
one
uses
the
word
more
to
make
a
comparison
of
greater
magnitude


example
children
are
more
intelligent
than
adults


to
make
the
greatest
possible
comparison
one
uses
the
word
most


example
she
is
the
most
conscientious
person
i
have
ever
known


nouns
as
noun
in
the
english
language
it
is
possible
for
a
noun
to
modify
describe
another
noun


example
take
the
noun
angel
and
the
noun
face


put
them
together
and
the
result
is
angel
face


the
first
noun
is
acting
like
an
adjective
because
it
is
giving
us
information
about
the
second
noun


adjectives
and
adverbs
adjectives
are
words
we
use
to
describe
the
noun


simple
words
like
sparkling
and
fat
are
both
adjectives
commonly
used
in
writing


one
can
make
adverbs
from
some
adjectives
by
adding
the
suffix
ly


example
take
the
adjective
beautiful
the
adverb
is
beautifully


one
can
do
it
the
other
way
around
take
an
adverb
like
presumably
the
adjective
is


innocence
means
the
accused
is
assumed
to
be
innocent
until
proven
guilty
which
is
not
always
practiced
everywhere
however


the
adjective
guilty
becomes
the
adverb
and
vice
versa
the
other
way
round
the
opposite
the
adverb
becomes
the
adjective
guilty


as
a
rule
dogs
chase
cats
but
not
vice
versa


cats
seldom
chase
dogs
