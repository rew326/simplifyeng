this
became
known
in
cuba
as
the
special
period


because
of
the
disaster
cuba
changed
to
allow
less
control
by
the
government
more
discussion
amongst
the
people
and
private
shops
and
businesses


cuba
also
tried
to
get
tourists
to
visit
the
island


in
the
tourism
to
cuba
began
to
make
money
for
the
island
again


though
fidel
castro
had
remained
in
power
he
had
passed
all
duties
to
his
brother
after
an
illness


fidel
castro
is
years
old
and
was
one
of
the
longest
serving
heads
of
state


in
castro
became
the
official
president
of
cuba


for
military
service
men
from
the
age
of
to
years
old
must
go
to
the
army


demographics
the
population
of
cuba
is
close
to
million


the
people
of
cuba
come
from
three
different
groups


the
largest
group
is
the
descendants
of
the
spanish
settlers
who
came
to
cuba


the
smallest
group
is
the
descendants
of
the
black
african
slaves
who
were
brought
in
to
do
the
work
and
birth
children
in
the
as
new
world
slaves
who
could
be
legally
sold
into
life
time
bondage
in
the
united
states


the
group
is
a
mix
of
african
and
spanish


the
government
succeeded
in
seeing
that
the
three
different
groups
were
treated
the
same


according
to
a
caribbean
studies
institute
the
of
the
population
of
cuba
is
european
cubans
descend
from
settlers
that
came
during
the
very
late
century
and
onward


most
white
cubans
came
from
many
different
parts
of
spain
but
the
most
numerous
were
the
canary
islanders
and


there
was
as
well
some
french
italian
and
english
peoples


whites
makeup
approximately
of
cuba
population
as
of
and
they
mostly
populate
the
west
part
of
cuba
specially
cities
like
havana
and
del
rio


these
brought
with
them
their
language
religions
music
and
others


africans
and
mulatto
cubans
descend
from
the
arrival
of
african
slaves
that
came
from
various
parts
of
africa
but
the
most
numerous
were
west
africans


there
were
also
more
than
haitians
that
came
to
cuba
during
the
haitian
revolution
days


most
cuban
slaves
tended
to
come
from
the
and
<collocation>yoruba tribes</collocation>
there
were
also
the
ewes
and
some
others


range
enormously
from
percent
to
percent
of
the
population
and
they
are
mostly
concentrated
in
the
east
parts
of
cuba


these
brought
with
them
their
instruments
and
customs
to
the
cuban
culture


mediterranean
cubans
are
about
of
the
population
however
one
must
know
that
a
lot
of
the
<collocation>southern spaniard</collocation>
cuban
descendants
have
good
portion
of
moor
blood
in
their
family
lines
due
to
the
close
proximate
spain
is
to
north
africa


many
mediterranean
cubans
came
during
the
and
sometimes
onward


these
are
most
concentrated
in
the
east
specially
cities
like
bay


they
brought
much
of
their
foods
and
cuisines
to
cuba
and
a
few


health
and
education
cuba
is
a
developing
country
and
is
often
depicted
as
a
very
poor
country


in
some
aspects
however
like
education
health
care
and
life
expectancy
it
ranks
much
better
than
most
countries
in
latin
america


its
infant
death
rate
is
lower
than
some
developed
countries


the
average
life
expectancy
is
years


all
the
children
are
required
to
go
to
school
from
six
to
twelve
years
old
and
nearly
everybody
is
able
to
read
and
write
at
least


there
is
free
education
at
every
level


because
of
this
cuba

food
programme
certified
cuba
to
be
the
only
country
