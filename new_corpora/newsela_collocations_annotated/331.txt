main
engineering
civil
engineering
is
the
term
for
the
work
of
designing
and
building
infrastructure


it
usually
means
large
structures
like
bridges
dams
buildings
and
tunnels


it
also
covers
complicated
networks
such
as
water
irrigation
and
sewerage
networks


it
also
covers
the
construction
of
houses
and
homes


civil
engineers
can
be
involved
in
all
stages
in
the
life
of
infrastructure
from
planning
and
construction
to
maintenance
and
demolition


civil
engineering
often
overlaps
with
architecture


civil
engineering
is
made
up
of
many
different
areas
or
disciplines


some
important
areas
are
structures
environmental
construction
management
hydrology
transportation
and
materials


it
is
important
for
civil
engineers
to
have
an
understanding
of
all
these
disciplines
as
projects
often
involve
many
of
them
at
the
same
time

requires
training


construction
workers
will
train
at
a
center
and
on
the
job
training
while
doing
the
job
sometimes
with

to
be
a
professional
in
civil
engineering
requires
study
at
a
university
or
college


civil
engineers
often
study
subjects
like
structures
materials
physics
and
calculus


the
profession
of
civil
engineering
is
represented
by
professional
bodies
in
various
countries


in
the
the
institution
of
civil
engineers
promotes
civil
engineering
as
a
discipline
and
supports
engineers
throughout
their
careers


the
american
society
of
civil

performs
a
similar
task
in

professional
engineers
often
choose
to
become
chartered
engineers


shows
employers
and
clients
that
they
are
both
qualified
and
experienced
in
their
jobs


civil
engineers
usually
have
to
write
a

essay
and
take

for

it

construction
today
references
history
before
the
bridge
the
only
way
to
go
north
from
san
francisco
to
county
was
by
ferryboat


the
trip
by
ferry
took
minutes
to
complete


before
the
bridge
was
built
san
francisco
was
the
biggest
american
city
still
served
mostly
by
ferries


some
experts
did
not
think
that
people
could
build
a
bridge
because
the
water
currents
between
and
san
francisco
were
very
strong


also
the
water
was
very
deep
in
the
middle
m
and
there
was
a
lot
of
wind
and
fog
that
could
make
building
a
bridge
difficult


in
san
francisco
city
engineer
asked
other
engineers
to
offer
ideas
for
a
bridge


one
man
joseph
strauss
designed
a
very
cheap
bridge
only
million
but
many
thought
it
was
ugly


local
authorities
asked
him
to
change
the
design
and
to
work
with
other
experts


he
and
other
experts
especially
architect
morrow
designed
the
bridge
again
this
time
as
a
<collocation>suspension bridge</collocation>


a
<collocation>suspension bridge</collocation>
has
tall
towers
that
hold
long
cables
and
the
cables
hold
up
or
suspend
the
bridge


the
bridge
is
called
the
golden
gate
bridge
because
it
crosses
the
golden
gate
strait
the
area
of
water
between
the
san
francisco
peninsula
and
the
county
peninsula


in
people
in
san
francisco
and
county
agreed
that
the
local
governments
could
sell
bonds
to
the
public
to
raise
money
for
the
bridge


the
new
bridge
was
going
to
cost
million


but
it
was
difficult
for
the
governments
to
sell
the
bonds
at
the
time
because
of
the
wall
<collocation>street crash</collocation>
of


finally
the
bank
of
america
which
was
based
in
san
francisco
agreed
to
buy
all
the
bonds
to
help
the
local
economy


construction
the
golden
gate
bridge
construction
began
on
january
and
was
finished
in
april


eleven
men
died
during
the
construction
so
the
builders
put
a
net
under
the
bridge
for
the
safety
of
the
builders


nineteen
men
were
saved
by
the
net


when
they
finished
the
bridge
they
painted
it
with
a
sealant
a
type
of
paint
that
protects
the
bridge
from
water
and
humidity


people
liked
the
color
because
it
looked
good
with
the
bridge
surroundings
and
it
was
easy
to
see
in
the
fog
so
the
bridge
was
officially
painted
with
the
color
called
international
orange


today
people
can
cross
the
bridge
in
cars
or
motorcycles
any
time


during
<collocation>daylight hours</collocation>
they
can
cross
by
bicycle
or
on
foot


they
can
not
cross
the
bridge
on
roller
skates
skateboards
or
mopeds


when
the
bridge
opened
drivers
had
to
pay
cents
to
cross
the
bridge
in
either
direction


today
when
drivers
go
north
on
the
bridge
leaving
san
francisco
they
do
not
have
to
pay
but
starting
on
september
when
going
south
entering
san
francisco
they
have
to
pay
if
they
pay
cash
or
if
they
buy
a
pass


people
often
jump
off
the
bridge
to
commit
suicide
kill
themselves


they
fall

of
them

steps
in
creating
software
software
engineering
can
broadly
be
split
into
the
following
steps
requirements
say
what
the
software
should
do


software
design
is
usually
done
on
paper


it
says
what
the
different
parts
of
the
software
are
and
how
they
talk
to
each
other


after
the
design
phase
is
done
each
component
part
of
the
software
is
coded


code
is
what
tells
the
computer
exactly
what
to
do
at
each
step


testing
is
done
to
see
if
the
components
meet
the
requirements
and
that
the
system
as
a
whole
meet
the
requirements


part
or
all
of
this
process
can
repeat
if
bugs
are
found
or
new
requirements
are
needed


tools

a
suburb
is
an
area
of

a
little
away
from

part
where
there
are
fewer
big
buildings

mainly

these
are
called

sometimes
cities
have

area


the
suburbs
are

may

not


since
the
beginning
of
the

century
cities
have
spread
very
quickly
and
spread
farther


transport
in
the
form
of
trams
buses
and
cars
allows
commuting
from
distant
homes
to
work
in
the
inner
city


this
led
to
the
growth
of
the
suburbs


housing
commonly
includes
detached
and
houses
and
flats


houses
are
built
farther
apart
than
in
the
inner
city
and
there
is
often
space
for
gardens
and
parks


as
cities
grow
outwards
they
begin
to
take
over
the
surrounding
countryside


authorities
have
created
green
belts
on
the
undeveloped
land
around
a
city
to
prevent
<collocation>urban sprawl</collocation>
and
to
prevent
the
towns
and
cities
merging
into

they
also
encourages
development
within
the
town
and
protect
the
countryside


the
need
for
new
houses
particularly
large
detached
and
houses
in
pleasant
surroundings
means
that
some
areas
of
green
belt
land
have
been
built
on
and
others
are
threatened


that
because
it

cheaper
to

land

the
golden
rule
is
a
moral
which
says
treat
others
as
you
would
like
them
to
treat
you


this
moral
is
used
as
a
basis
in
the
<collocation>human rights</collocation>


it
is
called
the
golden
rule
because
there
is
value
in
having
this
kind
of
respect
and
caring
attitude
for
one
another


people
of
many
religions
see
the
value
of
this
mandate
and
have
similar
expressions


in
christianity
<collocation>jesus christ</collocation>
taught
this
idea
to
his
disciples
and
others
when
he
gave
his
sermon
on
the
mount


it
is
recorded
in
the
holy
bible
in
the
book
of
matthew
chapter
and
verse


jesus
explained
to
his
listeners
that
all
the
things
that
were
recorded
in
the
jewish
law
and
that
the
prophets
had
taught
about
concerning
morality
was
summed
up
in
this
one
rule


the
context
of
this
statement
matthew
is
in
regard
to
god
mercy
and
kindness


the
principle
that
was
shared
is
to
not
always
treat
others
as
they
might
deserve
to
be
treated
as
we
may
judge
some
as
undeserving
but
instead
to
always
be
merciful
and
charitable
not
withholding
good


some
philosophers
consider
the
idea
that
this
statement
can
be
interpreted
according
to
one
personal
ethics
which
may
include
wishing
harm
to
one
self
so
that
it
instead
becomes
permissive
to
harm
others


what
jesus
said
was
to
not
be
judgemental
as
we
all
make
mistakes
do
not
focus
on
the
behavior
of
others
but
instead
focus
on
your
own
behavior
and
attitude
and
let
it
be
good


in
other
religions
and
belief
systems
there
is
a
similar
concept
of
the
ethic
of
reciprocity
also
called
the
golden
rule


however
there
is
an
important
distinguishing
trait
about
the
golden
rule
of
christianity


the
gold
in
the
golden
rule
is
given
without
expectation
of
the
act
or
attitude
being


if
every
one
gave
freely
of
themselves
in
this
way
we
would
become
rich
indeed
and
perhaps
begin
to
see
the
goodness
of
god
in
effect
as
he
intended
it
to
be
