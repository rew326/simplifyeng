some
people
believe
that
most
humans
are
happier
if
they
do
not
think
too
much
about
their
life


socrates
also
taught
that
many
people
can
look
at
something
and
not
truly
see
it


he
asked
questions
about
the
meaning
of
life
and
goodness


these
are
still
very
important
questions


much
of
philosophy
love
of
wisdom
is
about
these
things


legacy
socrates
is
seen
by
some
people
as
a
martyr
since
he
willingly
died
to
support
the
idea
that
knowledge
and
wisdom
are
very
important
to
our
lives


socrates
is
known
as
one
of
the
most
important
philosophers
in
history
he
is
often
described
as
the
father
of
western
philosophy


he
did
not
start
western
philosophy
but
he
had
a
big
influence
on
it


before
socrates
philosophy
was
mainly
about
mathematics
and
answering
questions
about
our
natural
world


socrates
expanded
on
that
and
added
questions
about
ethics
politics
and
to
philosophy

as

not

about

education
and
it
is
presumed
he
studied
at
home


it
is
known
that
he
studied
<collocation>tuscan poetry</collocation>


his
interests
brought
him
to
discover
the
poetry
of
the
troubadours
and
the
latin
poetry
of
classical
antiquity
with
a
particular
devotion
to
virgil


at
dante
met

and
soon
after
together
they
became
the
leaders
of
dolce
novo
the
sweet
new
style


later
received
a
special
mention
in
the
<collocation>divine comedy</collocation>
inferno
for
what
he
had
taught
dante


according
to
his
work
la
vita
when
he
was
nine
years
old
he
met
beatrice
daughter
of
with
whom
he
fell
in
love
at
first
sight
and
apparently
without
even
having
spoken
to
her


he
saw
her
frequently
after
age
often
exchanging
greetings
in
the
street
but
he
never
knew
her
well
he
effectively
set
the
example
for
the
<collocation>courtly love</collocation>


dante
gave
his
imprint
to
the
novo


love
for
beatrice
as
in
a
different
manner
would
show
for
his
laura
would
apparently
be
the
reason
for
poetry
and
for
living
together
with
political
passions


in
many
of
his
poems
she
appears
such
as
watching
over
him
constantly


when
beatrice
died
in
dante
tried
to
find
help
in
latin
literature


he
then
dedicated
himself
to
philosophical
studies
at
religious
schools
like
the
dominican
one
in
santa
<collocation>maria novella</collocation>


this
excessive
passion
for
philosophy
would
later
be
criticized
by
the
character
beatrice
in
the
second
book
of
the
<collocation>divine comedy</collocation>

dismissed

charles

entered
florence
with

who
in

six

destroyed

was
put
in
exile
for
two
years
and
ordered
to
pay
a
large
hill
of
money


dante
did
not
pay
the
money
in
part
because
he
believed
he
was
not
guilty
and
in
part
because
all
his
needs
in
florence
had
been
stolen
by
the
black


he
was
condemned
to
exile
for
life
and
if
he
returned
to

without
paying
the
money
he
could
be
burned

whole
life
and
after

lots
of

it
