a
pronoun
is
traditionally
a
part
of
speech
in
grammar
though
many
modern
linguists
call
it
a
type
of
noun


in
english
pronouns
are
words
such
as
me
she
his
them
herself
each
other
it
what


pronouns
are
often
used
to
take
the
place
of
a
noun
when
that
noun
is
understood
has
already
been
named
to
avoid
repeating
it


for
example
instead
of
saying
tom
has
a
new
dog


tom
has
named
the
dog
max
and
tom
lets
the
dog
sleep
by
tom
bed


it
is
easier
to
say
tom
has
a
new
dog


he
has
named
it
max
and
he
lets
it
sleep
by
his
bed


when
a
pronoun
replaces
a
noun
the
noun
is
called
the
antecedent


but
there
are
times
when
the
pronoun
has
no
antecedent


this
is
because
generally
the
antecedent
what
comes
before
refers
grammatically
to
the
use
of
the
<collocation>relative pronoun</collocation>
in
particular


for
example
in
the
sentence
the
dog
that
was
walking
down
the
street
the
<collocation>relative pronoun</collocation>
is
the
word
that
referring
back
to
the
antecedent
the
word
dog


in
the
sentence
the
spy
who
loved
me
the
<collocation>relative pronoun</collocation>
is
the
word
who
and
its
antecedent
is
the
word
spy

references
differences

pronouns
also
rarely
come
after
adjectives


they
are
also
different
because
many
of
them
change
depending
on
how
they

changes

an
object

all
the

places
in

and

name
the

kinds
of
things
people

mines


types

the

was
the

george

might
kill
people


the

prevents
the
hot
flame
of
the
lamp
touching
the

gasses
reducing
the
chance
of
an
