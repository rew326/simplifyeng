metal


its
atmosphere
contains
hydrogen
helium
and
methane


the
temperature
on
uranus
is

but
its
small
solid
core
about
the

it
completes
its
turn
around
itself
in

this
means
there
are
about

uranus
has
rings
which
are
hard
to

this
planet
can
be
seen
with
the
naked

some
evidence
suggests
that
this

moons
uranus
has
known
moons


the
names
for
these
moons
are
chosen
from
characters
from
the
works
of
shakespeare
and
alexander
pope


the
five
biggest
moons
are
ariel
titania
and
oberon


many
moons
yet
have
been
discovered


they
remain
a
mystery


exploring
in
nasa
voyager
visited
uranus


the
visit
is
the
only
attempt
to
investigate
the
planet
from
a
short
distance


clouds
uranus
is
covered
in
blue
clouds


the
clouds
made
of
methane
are
difficult
to
see
as
they
are
low
in
the
atmosphere


there
are
also
violent
storms
on
the
surface
with
winds
that
blow
at
miles
per
hour


scientists
are
studying
the
clouds
to
try
and

the
storms
on
the
planet

the
planet
uranus
has
a
system
made
of
rings
between
the
more
extensive
set
around
saturn
and
the
simpler
systems
around
jupiter
and
neptune


the
rings
of
uranus
were
discovered
on
march
by
james
edward
and
douglas
mink


more
than
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
william
herschel
also
reported
observing
rings
but
modern
astronomers
do
not
believe
that
he
saw
them
because
they
are
very
dark
and
faint


two
additional
rings
were
discovered
in
in
images
taken
by
the
voyager
and
two
outer
rings
were
found
in
by
the
<collocation>hubble space</collocation>
telescope


as
of
people
know
that
the
<collocation>uranian ring</collocation>
system
have
rings


in
the
order
of
increasing
distance
from
the
planet
they
were
called
and


they
are
probably
composed
of
water
origins
the
rings
of
uranus
are
thought
to
be
relatively
young
not
more
than
million
years
old


the
<collocation>uranian ring</collocation>
system
probably
began
from
the
fragmentation
of
moons
that
once
existed
around
the
planet


after
colliding
the
moons
probably
broke
up
into
many
particles
which
survived
as
narrow
and
optically
dense
rings
only
in
strictly
confined
zones
of
<collocation>maximum stability</collocation>


general
properties
uranus
inner
rings


the
bright
outer
ring
is
the
<collocation>epsilon ring</collocation>
eight
other
rings
are
visible


as
we
know
currently
the
ring
system
of
uranus
has
thirteen
distinct
rings


in
order
of
increasing
distance
from
the
planet
they
are
rings


they
can
be
divided
into
three
groups
nine
narrow
main
rings
two
<collocation>dusty rings</collocation>
and
two
outer
rings


the
rings
of
uranus
consist
mainly
of
<collocation>macroscopic particles</collocation>
and
little
dust
although
dust
is
known
to
be
present
in
and
rings


in
addition
to
these
rings
there
may
be
numerous
optically
thin
dust
bands
and
faint
rings
between
them


these
faint
rings
and
dust
bands
may
exist
only
temporarily
or
consist
of
a
number
of
separate
arcs
which
are
sometimes
detected
during


some
of
them
became
visible
during
a
series
of
ring
events
in


a
number
of
dust
bands
between
the
rings
were
observed
in
a
a
none
geometry
by
voyager


all
rings
of
uranus
show
<collocation>brightness variations</collocation>


the
rings
are
made
of
an
extremely
dark
material


the
rings
are
slightly
red
in
the
ultraviolet
and
visible
parts
of
the
spectrum
and
gray
in


they
exhibit
no
identifiable
spectral
features


the
chemical
composition
of
the
ring
particles
is
not
known


however
they
can
not
be
made
of
pure
water
ice
like
the
rings
of
saturn
because
they
are
too
dark
darker
than
the
inner
moons
of
uranus


this
indicates
that
they
are
probably
composed
of
a
mixture
of
the
ice
and
a
dark
material


the
nature
of
this
material
is
not
clear
but
it
may
be
organic
compounds
considerably
darkened
by
the
charged
particle
irradiation
from
the
uranian
magnetosphere


the
rings
particles
may
consist
of
a
heavily
processed
material
which
was
initially
similar
to
that
of
the
inner
moons


as
a
whole
the
ring
system
of
uranus
is
unlike
either
the
faint
<collocation>dusty rings</collocation>
of
jupiter
or
the
broad
and
complex
rings
of
saturn
some
of
which
are
composed
of
very
bright
material
water
ice


however
there
are
similarities
with
some
parts
of
the
latter
ring
system
the
f
ring
and
the
ring
are
both
narrow
relatively
dark
and
are
shepherded
by
a
pair
of
moons


the
newly
discovered
outer
rings
of
uranus
are
similar
to
the
outer
g
and
e
rings
of
saturn


narrow
ringlets
existing
in
the
broad
rings
also
resemble
the
narrow
rings
of
uranus


in
addition
dust
bands
observed
between
the
main
rings
of
uranus
may
be
similar
to
the
rings
of
jupiter


in
contrast
the
<collocation>neptunian ring</collocation>
system
is
quite
similar
to
that
of
uranus
although
it
is
less
complex
darker
and
contains
more
dust
the
<collocation>neptunian rings</collocation>
are
also
positioned
further
from
the

latin
et
roughly
meaning
community
of
teachers

scholars


people
can

university
to
get
a

before
the

at
university
are

biology
at
university
has
lots
of
courses
about
biology
and
not
very
many
courses
in
other
fields
like

the
old
university
of
bologna
buildings
founded
in
the
universities
were
born
in
europe
during
the
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>


the
first
institution
of
this
type
was
the
university
of
bologna
that
later
became
a
model
for
similar
centers
of
education


this
term
can
often
be
used
in
other
cultures
to
mean
centers
of
higher
education
and
higher
thought
although
their
creation
was
often
well
before
the
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>


at
first
the
universities
had
formed
themselves
according
to
the
model
of
the
professional
groups
and
like
almost
everything
in
the
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>
they
remained
tied
to
the
catholic
church


at
the
beginning
they
had
worked
to
teach
the
seven
liberal
arts
the
and
the
grammar
logic
and
rhetoric


arithmetic
and
geometry
astronomy
and
music


that
earliest
division
caused
the
present
divisions
between
literary
and
scientific
fields


organization
a
university
can
include
several
campuses
or
different
places
where
classes
are
taught


in
each
campus
there
are
several
faculties
and
university
schools
mainly
for
teaching
and
also
laboratories
departments
and
institutes
of
research


many
campuses
also
have
housing
for
students
in
buildings
called
dormitories
and
structures
like
libraries
study
rooms
and
gymnasiums
for
students
that
live
there


each
school
offers
many
courses
that
students
take
to
earn
a
degree


the
person
with
the
highest
right
to
control
and
to
command
in
a
university
is
the
rector
who
governs
the
university
with

vocabulary
can
be
done
with
a
dictionary
or
a
dictionary
it
is
difficult
to
be
exact


some
words
may
be
understood
but
not
known
well
enough
to
be
used


words
that
are
used
are
part
of
a
person
active
vocabulary


words
that
are
only
understood
and
not
used
are
called
<collocation>passive vocabulary</collocation>


sometimes
it
may
not
be
easy
to
decide
if
a
word
is
understood


it
may
depend
on
the
context
or
the
words
around
it


knowing
the
context
the
word
is
being
used
in
may
make
it
possible
to
guess
what
it
means


without
knowing
what
a
is
the

the
english
language
has
a
very
large
vocabulary


this
is
because
of
britain
history


every
time
britain
was
invaded
the
new
people
brought
new
words


there
are
words
from
the
celts
anglo
saxons
vikings
romans
and
french


there
are
also
many
words
from
ancient
greek
and
latin


many
of
these
new
words
were
used
as
well
as
the
old
ones
but
they
may
have
a
different
meaning


for
example
pork
came
from
the
old
french
word
porc
pig
but
it
means
food
that
comes
from
a
pig


fact
date
april
in
english
some
long
words
may
be
hard
to
understand


this
could
be
because
they
were
taken
from
latin
or
greek


that
makes
it
difficult
to
guess
the
meaning
of
the
word


fact
date
april
using
big
words
does
not
always
make
the
meaning
clear


this

are
not
always
used

the
same
ways

have
different

in
some
other
languages
chinese
indonesian

walk
she

you
should
notice
that
some
of
the
verb
forms
look
the
same


you
can
say
they
have
the
same
shape


for
example
the
plain
present
and
the
plain
form
of
walk
have
the
same
shape


the
same
is
true
for
the
past
and
the
past
participle


but
these
different
forms
can
have
different
shapes
in
other
verbs


for
example
the
plain
present
of
be
is
usually
are
but
the
plain
form
is
be


also
the
past
of
eat
is
ate
but
the
past
participle
is
eaten


when
you
look
for
a
verb
in
the
dictionary
it
is
usually
the
plain
form
that
you
look
for
