for
the
club
that
broke
off
from
this
one
football
club
was
an
english
football
club


the
club
began
in
in


in
it
moved
to
milton
and
it
it
changed
its
name
to
milton
dons


many
football
fans
in
did
not
agree
with
the
move


they
decided
to
start
a
new
club
there
which
is
called


the
club
played
in
the
english
football
league
and
won
the
fa
cup
in


it
was
a
professional
football
club
which
means
that
the
players
get
paid
to
play


first
move
out
of
in
the
club
decided
that
it
ground
at
plough
lane
was
too
small
and
moved
away
from
to
park
in
croydon


this
ground
is
owned
by
<collocation>crystal palace</collocation>


they
stayed
there
for
the
next
years


second
move
out
of
london
to
milton
in
the
club
owners
decided
that
they
wanted
to
move
the
club
out
of
london


nobody
really
knows
why
they
wanted
to
move


they
said
that
there
were
too
many
clubs
in
london
that
not
enough
people
were
coming
to
watch
the
matches


this
meant
that
they
did
not
collect
enough
money
at
the
gate
to
pay
everyone
and
that
is
why
they
could
not
afford
to
stay


they
looked
at
and
dublin
before
deciding
to
move
to
milton


milton
is
a
new
city
that
is
miles
or
kilometres
north
of
london


when
they
said
what
they
wanted
to
do
most
of
their
fans
stopped
paying
to
see
matches
which
meant
that
they
had
even
less
money
to
pay
everyone


before
the
move
could
happen
they
had
to
get
permission
from
the
football
association
the
fa


the
fa
is
the
association
of
all
the
football
clubs
in
england


the
clubs
elect
a
committee
to
decide
what
to
do
about
things


most
things
they
have
to
decide
are
easy
but
this
was
not
easy
to
decide


or
maybe
they
knew
what
to
decide
but
did
not
want
to
be
the
ones
to
decide
it


so
they
asked
three
clever
men
to
study
the
problem
and
tell
them
what
would
be
best
to
do


these
three
men
said
that
the
club
should
be
allowed
to
move


some
members
of
the
committee
did
not
like
this
decision
and
tried
to
stop
it


but
the
owners
of
said
that
they
would
get
a
judge
to
decide
in
a
court
if
anyone
tried
to
stop
them


it
costs
a
lot
of
money
to
go
to
court
and
whoever
loses
has
to
pay
for
everybody


the
other
clubs
would
not
agree
to
pay
if
this
happened
so
the
fa
had
to
disagree
the
move


but
it
was
already
too
late
for
the
owners
of


they
had
no
money
left


they
had
borrowed
money
from
the
bank
to
keep
going
but
now
the
bank
wanted
its
money
back


when
you
can
not
pay
back
what
you
borrow
this
is
called
going
bankrupt
and
that
is
what
happened


luckily
or
unluckily
depends
on
your
point
of
view
the
group
in
milton
that
first
wanted
them
to
come
still
wanted
them


so
this
group
paid
back
some
of
the
money
and
in
the
club
moved
to
milton


they
began
playing
in
the
national
hockey
stadium
beside
milton
central
railway
station
and
stayed
there
for
two
years
until
their
new
stadium
was
ready


many
football
fans
around
england
did
not
like
the
idea
that
a
club
could
move


they
believe
that
a
club
belongs
to
a
town
and
it
is
not
like
a
<collocation>furniture shop</collocation>
that
closes
down
in
one
town
and
opens
in
another
town


another
reason
that
they
did
not
like
it
is
that
they
would
love
to
see
their
own
club
get
into
the
football
league


the
only
way
that
they
can
do
that
is
if
they
win
their
regional
league
then
win
the
football
conference


so
they
felt
that
milton
was
jumping
the
queue
to
get
into
the
league


because
of
this
many
fans
refused
to
attend
boycotted
any
games
they
played
milton
in
the
new
owners
changed
the
name
to
milton
dons
usually
just
mk
dons
which
combined
the
name
of
their
new
home
milton
with
the
nickname
dons
from


with
this
fc
ceased
to
exist


but
the
boycott
continued


in
the
football
<collocation>fans federation</collocation>
proposed
a
way
forward


the
most
important
thing
for
the
town
of
was
the
trophies
cups
shields
that
the
club
had
won
when
it
was
called


the
agreement
was
that
milton
dons
would
give
these
trophies
to
merton
borough
council
which
is
the
local
government
area
that
contains


the
league
history
of
milton
dons
would
start
from
which
is
when
they
changed
their
name


the
<collocation>fans federation</collocation>
would
ask
fans
to
end
the
boycott


everybody
agreed
and
this
is
what
has
happened
