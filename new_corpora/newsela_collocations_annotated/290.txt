orbit
is
also
a
word
for
an
<collocation>eye socket</collocation>


two
bodies
with
a
slight
difference
in
mass
orbiting
around
a
common


this
is
like
the
pluto
charon
system


an
orbit
is
the
path
that
an
object
takes
in
space
when
it
goes
around
a
star
a
planet
or
a
moon


it
can
also
be
used
as
a
verb


for
instance
the
earth
orbits
around
the
sun


the
word
revolves
has
the
same
meaning
but
rotates
is
the
spin
of
the
object


many
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
people
thought
that
the
sun
orbits
in
a
circle
around
the
earth


every
morning
the
sun
came
up
in
the
east
and
went
down
in
the
west


it
just
seemed
to
make
sense
that
it
was
going
around
the
earth


but
now
thanks
to
people
like
copernicus
and
galileo
galilei
we
know
that
the
sun
is
the
center
of
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
and
the
earth
orbits
around
it


<collocation>isaac newton</collocation>
discovered
that
gravity
controls
the
orbit
of
the
planets
and
moons


since
a
satellite
is
an
object
in
space
that
revolves
around
another
object
the
earth
is
a
satellite
of
the
sun
just
like
the
moon
is
a
satellite
of
the
earth


the
sun
has
lots
of
satellites
orbiting
around
it
like
the
planets
and
thousands
of
asteroids
comets
and


the
earth
just
has
one
natural
satellite
the
moon
but
there
are
many
artificial
satellites
orbiting
the
earth


when
people
first
began
to
think
about
orbits
they
thought
that
all
orbits
had
to
be
<collocation>perfect circles</collocation>
and
they
thought
that
the
circle
was
a
perfect
shape


but
when
people
began
to
study
the
motions
of
planets
carefully
they
saw
that
the
planets
were
not
moving
in
<collocation>perfect circles</collocation>


some
of
the
planets
have
orbits
that
are
almost
<collocation>perfect circles</collocation>
and
others
have
orbits
that
are
more
oblong
egg
shaped


orbital
period
an
orbital
period
is
the
time
that
it
takes
for
one
object
that
is
satellite
to
orbit
around
another
object


for
instance
the
earth
orbital
period
is
one
year
days


the
extra
is
why
we
have
a
leap
day
once
every
four
years


the
moon
takes
days
days
as
seen
from
earth
to
go
around
the
earth
and
also
to
rotate
around
its
own
axis


this
is
why
only
one
side
always
faces
the
earth
and
the
<collocation>dark side</collocation>
of
the
moon
faces
away
it
is
called
dark
because
we
can
not
see
it
though
all
sides
of
the
moon
get
equal
light


one
lunar
year
and
one
lunar
day
take
the
same
amount
of
time


elliptical
and
eccentric
orbits
johannes
lived
wrote
mathematical
laws
of
planetary
motion
which
gave
a
<collocation>good idea</collocation>
of
the
movements
of
the
planets
because
he
found
that
the
orbits
of
the
planets
in
our
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
are
not
really
circles
but
are
really
a
shape
like
an
egg
or
a
flattened
circle


that
is
why
orbits
are
described
as
elliptical


the
more
elliptical
an
orbit
is
the
more
eccentric
the
orbit
is


this
is
called
orbital
eccentricity


<collocation>isaac newton</collocation>
lived
used
his
own
ideas
about
gravity
to
show
why
laws
worked
the
way
they
did


a
<collocation>funeral procession</collocation>
in
peru
funeral
is
an
official
ceremony
of
someone
who
has
died


most
religions
have
their
own
style
of
funeral
ceremony


a
funeral
ceremony
can
be
held
in
the
house
of
the
dead
a
church
a
temple
or
a
public
place


the
family
and
friends
of
the
dead
come
together
remember
the
dead
and
comfort
each
other


if
it
is
a
religious
ceremony
they
say
a
prayer
for
the
dead
so
that
his
or
her
soul
may
rest
in
peace


there
are
lots
of
different
traditions
that
different
religions
use


sometimes
at
funerals
the
family
or
friends
of
the
dead
person
want
to
pray
or
say
something
nice
about
them


at
christian
funerals
the
priest
or
preacher
may
say
from
earth
to
earth
ashes
to
ashes
dust
to
dust


modern
funerals
have
greatly
changed
over
time


present
day
funeral
or
memorial
services
may
often
be
more
like
a
thanksgiving
for
the
life
of
the
dead
person
rather
than
just
thinking
about
the
sadness
of
death


modern
funerals
at
many
present
day
funerals
there
is
a
video
tribute
played
before
after
or
during
the
funeral
service


<collocation>memorial folders</collocation>
or
prayer
cards
are
handed
out
at
many
funeral
services
and
this
too
is
a
way
to
make
a
funeral
service
personal


at
funerals
it
is
not
uncommon
to
see
a
life
reflection
table


family
members
bring
favorite
pictures
or
memorabilia
to
display
as
another
reminder
of
the
deceased
the
person
who
has
died


headstones
are
bought
so
that
everyone
can
see
who
has
been
buried
in
a
specific
grave


they
usually
tell
the
name
date
of
birth
and
the
date
of
death

april
the
georgian
uprising
of
april
may
was
an
insurrection
a
rebellion
or
mutiny
when
soldiers
disobey
their
orders
by
soviet
georgian
soldiers
on
the
island
of


the
uprising
was
against
the
germans
who
had
taken
over
the
dutch
island
during
the
second
<collocation>world war</collocation>


the
event
is
sometimes
described
as
europe
last
battlefield


the
island
was
very
important
in
the
german
atlantic
wall
the
line
of
defences
along
the
atlantic
coast


it
was
strong
and
had
many
defences


the
were
soldiers
from
the
soviet
republic
of
georgia
who
had
been
captured
taken
prisoner
on
the
eastern
front


they
were
now
fighting
for
the
germans
so
that
they
did
not
have
to
stay
in
camps
for
prisoners


their
job
was
to
help
the
german
troops


on
the
night
of
april
april
they
thought
that
the
allies
would
land
soon


they
took
over
the
island
and
killed
german
soldiers


some
parts
of
the
island
stayed
under
german
control
and
the
georgian
soldiers
could
not
capture
them


more
germans
were
able
to
come
to
the
island
to
help
defeat
the


after
a
few
weeks
of
very
tough
fighting
the
germans
took
control
of
the
island
again


unfortunately
the
british
and
canadians
who
were
warned
of
the
events
on
by
escapees
who
fled
by
boat
to
england
did
not
believe
them
and
did
not
take
any
action
in
order
to
stop
the
fighting


on
this
is
called
the
russian
war


approximately
germans
and
people
from
the
island
were
killed


lots
of
farms
were
burned


even
after
the
germans
surrendered
gave
up
in
the
netherlands
and
denmark
on
may
and
after
the
full
german
surrender
on
may
the
fighting
continued


canadian
soldiers
stopped
the
fighting
on
may


the
georgian
survivors
did
not
have
a
happy
ending


they
were
sent
back
to
the
soviet
union


stalin
said
that
because
the
soldiers
had
been
captured
by
the
germans
they
had
not
fought
until
they
died
so
they
were
traitors


most
of
the
two
million
soviet
prisoners
who
were
sent
back
to
the
soviet
union
by
the
allied
forces
after
the
end
of
the
war
were
executed
killed
when
they
got
there

e

neutrinos
are
a
type
of
elementary
particle
that
exist
all
across
the
universe


physicists
study
these
particles
but
they
are
hard
to
find
because
they
have
a
very
small
chance
of
interacting
with
regular
matter


for
example
they
pass
through
the
whole
earth
without
touching
any
other
particles


neutrinos
travel
near
the
speed
of
light


we
used
to
think
that
they
have
no
mass
but
a
few
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
physicists
found
that
they
have
a
very
small
mass
much
lighter
than
electrons


by
finding
neutrinos
we
can
learn
about
the
structure
and
the
history
of
the
universe


neutrinos
are
very
difficult
to
detect


they
are
very
unlikely
to
collide
interact
in
this
case
with
other
particles
as
they
travel
through
space
or
through
matter


unlike
negatively
charged
electrons
neutrinos
have
no
charge
neutrino
meaning
small
neutral
particle


this
means
that
they
are
unaffected
by
the
electromagnetic
force
too


detectors
built
to
find
them
only
see
a
year


they
are
commonly
generated
in
<collocation>particle accelerators</collocation>
the
sun
nuclear
reactions
and
other
stars


they
are
generated
whenever
there
is
a
nuclear
reaction
in
the
form
of
<collocation>beta decay</collocation>


this
process
starts
off
with
one
neutron
and
ends
with
one
electron
one
proton
and
one
neutrino


the
types
of
neutrinos
are
named
after
the
previous
three
leptons


there
is
the
<collocation>electron neutrino</collocation>
v
e
the
muon
neutrino
v
and
the
tau
neutrino
v


each
neutrino
has
an
called
an


therefore
there
is
an
electron
a
muon
and
tau


the
three
types
of
neutrinos
change
into
each
other
over
time
so
an
<collocation>electron neutrino</collocation>
could
turn
into
a
tau
neutrino
and
then
back
again


this
is
called
neutrino
oscillation


this
was
first
suggested
as
there
were
only
a
third
of
the
number
of
electron
neutrinos
coming
from
the
sun
as
theories
of
the
time
said
there
should
be


most

a
play
is
a
piece
of
writing
literature
which
can
be
seen
at
a
theater
or
on
television
or
heard
on
the
radio


plays
often
show
conversations
between
people


a
play
is
usually
watched
rather
than
being
read


the
people
who
appear
in
a
play
are
actors
in
a
theater
they
stand
on
a
stage
so
the
people
watching
the
audience
can
see
them
better


a
director
helps
the
actors
to
work
better
or
tells
them
how
he
wants
the
play
to
be


plays
can
be
very
interesting
because
they
can
be
understood
in
many
different
ways


when
the
writer
the
playwright
makes
the
play
he
can
not
say
how
the
actors
or
director
will
use
it


sometimes
the
playwright
is
also
the
director
or
an
actor
for
example
was
often
an
actor
in
his
plays


but
the
director
can
change
the
play
in
different
ways
the
actors
costume
the
music
how
people
say
things
how
they
move
or
what
they
hold


modern
directors
can
direct
plays
by
shakespeare
and
these
old
plays
seem
modern
now
too


there
are
many
sorts
of
plays
but
there
are
six
important
sorts
tragedy
the
end
is
sad
because
of
bad
luck
because
the
hero
is
not
perfect
or
because
of
the
gods


comedy
the
end
is
happy


some
things
in
this
sort
of
play
are
funny
it
makes
us
laugh


<collocation>domestic drama</collocation>
the
play
is
about
normal
life
family
and
friends


tragicomedy
this
play
is
both
a
tragedy
and
a
comedy


melodrama
this
sort
of
play
often
has
a
happy
ending


in
it
there
is
a
villain
a
bad
person
but
the
hero
and
often
a
heroine
win


the
emotions
are
very
strong


symbolic
this
sort
of
play
is
about
ideas


the
people
in
the
play
are
not
so
important


symbolic
can
also
be
called
expressionistic


its
all
about
how
the
writer
or
director
presents
ideas
in
a
very
different
point
of
view


experimental
this
is
a
play
in
which
the
director
and
actors
can
try
out
new
ideas


anything
can
be
tried
out


it
is
an
experiment

sometimes

a

very
different

some
text
books
call
these
verbs

many
students
of
english
as
a
foreign
language
panic
when
they
hear
the
term
verbs
but
in
fact
verbs
are
just
vocabulary
to
memorize
and
not
some
strange
secret
grammatical
formula


in
fact
many
native
speakers
of
english
do
not
know
the
term

at
all
even
though
they
probably

them
very
often

always
use
a
