organisms

growth
growth
is
the
enlargement

organism


growth
continues
after
the
embryonic
stage
and
occurs
through
cell
division
enlargement
of
cells
or
accumulation

in
plants
growth
results

metamorphosis
frog
many
animals
have
a
<collocation>larval stage</collocation>
with
a
body
plan
different
from
that
of
the
adult
organism


the
larva
develops
into
an
adult
in
a
process
called
metamorphosis


for
example
caterpillars
butterfly
larvae
are
specialized
for
feeding
whereas
adult
butterflies
are
specialised
for
flight
and
reproduction


when
the
caterpillar
has
grown
enough
it
turns
into
an
immobile
pupa


here
the
develops
from
discs
found
inside
the
larva


regeneration
regeneration
is
the
reactivation
of
development
so
that
a
missing
body
part
grows
back


this
phenomenon
has
been
studied
particularly
in
salamanders
where
the
adults
can
reconstruct
a
whole
limb
after
it
has
been
amputated


<collocation>researchers hope</collocation>
to
one
day
be
able
to
induce
regeneration
in
humans


there
is
little
spontaneous
regeneration
in
adult
humans
although
the
liver
is
a
notable
exception


like
for
salamanders
the
regeneration
of
the
liver
involves
reversing
some
cells
to
an
earlier
state

star
forming
region
in
the
large

perhaps
the
closest
galaxy
to
earth
milky
way
space
also
known
as
outer
space
is
the
near
vacuum
between
<collocation>celestial bodies</collocation>


it
is
where
everything
all
of
the
planets
stars
galaxies
and
other
objects
is
found


on
earth
space
begins
at
the
line
km
above
sea
level


this
is
where
earth
atmosphere
is
said
to
stop
and
outer
space
begins


this
is
not
a
<collocation>firm boundary</collocation>
but
is
a
convention
used
by
scientists
and
diplomats


however
the
space
near
earth
is
quite
crowded
by
astronomical
standards


a
list
of
spaces
goes
like
this
is
the
region
of
outer
space
near
earth


includes
the
upper
region
of
the
atmosphere
and
the
magnetosphere


the
van
allen
radiation
belt
lies
within
the


the
space
inside
the
magnetosphere
is
protected
from
radiation
from
the
sun


it
has
a
<collocation>low level</collocation>
of
electrically
charged
particles


interplanetary
space
is
the
space
around
the
sun
and
planets
of
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>


it
has
the
solar
wind
a
continuous
stream
of
charged
particles
from
the
sun


this
stream
creates
a
very
thin
atmosphere
the
for
billions
of
miles
into
space


interplanetary
space
has
the
magnetic
field
generated
by
the
sun


there
are
also
generated
by
planets
such
as
jupiter
saturn
mercury
and
the
earth


these
<collocation>magnetic fields</collocation>
can
trap
particles
from
the
solar
wind
and
other
sources
creating
belts
of
magnetic
particles
such
as
the
van
allen
radiation
belt


planets
without
<collocation>magnetic fields</collocation>
such
as
mars
have
their
atmospheres
gradually
stripped
off
by
the
solar
wind


interstellar
space
is
the
physical
space
within
a
galaxy
not
occupied
by
stars
or
their
planetary
systems


it
continues
to
the
edges
of
the
galaxy
where
it
fades
into
the
intergalactic
void


most
of
the
mass
in
this
space
is
made
up
of
single
hydrogen
atoms
fewer
helium
atoms
and
a
few
heavier
atoms
formed
in
stars


supernovae
blow
some
of
their
atoms
huge


a
number
of
molecules
and
tiny
dust
particles
do
exist
in
interstellar
space


about
four
new
types
of
molecule
are
discovered
each
year


large
regions
of
higher
density
matter
known
as
molecular
clouds
allow
chemical
reactions
to
occur


this
organic
species


much
of
this
chemistry
is
driven
by
collisions
