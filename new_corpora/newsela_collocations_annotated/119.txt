if
there

one

the

a
game

an
easy
game
to
learn
the
moves
but
a
difficult
game
to
master


strategy
is
an
important
part
of
the
game


first
of
all
comes
the
openings
about
which
a
great
deal
is
now
known

the

moving
his

pawn
on
forward
two
spaces
to


black
can
reply
to
that
move
in
various
ways


opening
main
list
of
chess
openings
the
first
moves
of
a
chess
game
are
called
the
opening


a
chess
opening
is
a
name
given
to
a
series
of
opening
moves


recognized
patterns
of
opening
moves
are
openings
and
have
been
given
names
such
as
the
or
<collocation>sicilian defense</collocation>


they
are
listed
in
reference
works
such
as
the
encyclopaedia
of
chess
openings


there
are
dozens
of
different
openings


they
range
from
gambits
where
a
pawn
say
is
offered
for
fast
development
the
king
gambit
to
slower
openings
which
lead
to
a
<collocation>manoeuvring type</collocation>
of
game
the
opening


in
some
opening
lines
the
sequence
thought
best
for
both
sides
has
been
worked
out
to
moves
but
most
players
avoid
such
lines


expert
players
study
openings
throughout
their
chess
career
as
opening
theory
keeps
on
developing


the
basic
aims
of
the
opening
phase
are
development
to
place
develop
the
pieces
mostly
bishops
and
knights
on
useful
squares
where
they
will
have
the
most
powerful
impact
on
the
game


control
of
the
center
the
center
is
the
most
important
part
of
the
board


the
player
who
controls
the
center
can
move
his
pieces
around
freely


his
opponent
on
the
other
hand
will
find
his
<collocation>pieces cramped</collocation>
and
difficult
to
move
about

pawns
can
be
used
to
control
the

players
try
to
avoid
making
<collocation>pawn weaknesses</collocation>
such
as
isolated
doubled
or
backward
pawns
and
pawn
islands
and
to
force
such
weaknesses
in
the

position


players
think
and
<collocation>chess databases</collocation>
prove
that
white
by
virtue
of
the
first
move

the
game
with
a
better
chance


black
normally
tries
to
or
to
get
some
counterplay


main
the
is
the
part
of
the
game
after
most
pieces
have
been
developed


it
is
where
most
games
are
won
and
lost


many
games
will
end
in
resignation
even
before
an
endgame
takes
place


a
position
has
a
structure


that
structure
is
determined
by
the
opening


the
simplest
way
to
learn
the
is
to
select
an
opening
and
learn
it
well
see
examples
in
english
opening
and
french
defense


these
are
some
things
to
look
for
when
looking
at
a
position
material
changes
in
the
balance
of
material
are
critical


to
lose
a
piece
for
nothing
is
enough
to
lose
a
game


if
the
players
are
evenly
matched
then
a
rough
<collocation>material balance</collocation>
of
pieces
is
normal


<collocation>material balance</collocation>
is
often
quite
static
it
does
not
change
for
many
moves


development
the
opening
may
have
left
one
player
with
a
lead
in
development


that
player
has
the
initiative
and
may
attack
before
the
opponent
can
get
his
pieces
out


it
is
a
temporary
asset
if
a
lead
in
development
is
not
used
effectively
it
will
disappear


the
center
in
the
center
pieces
have
their
greatest
effect
and
some
such
as
the
knight
attack
more
squares
in
the
center
than
at
the
sides


the
player
who
controls
the
center
will
almost
always
have
the
advantage


mobility
a
position
is
mobile
if
the
pieces
can
get
where
they
need
to


almost
all
middle
game
positions
have
some
limitations
to
mobility


look
for
open
files
for
the
rooks
and
open
diagonals
for
the
bishops


outposts
are
what
knights
need
places
where
they
can
not
easily
be
dislodged


king
safety
where
is
the
king


ideally
a
king
should
be
and
kept
behind
a
screen
of
pawns


many
other
things
may
happen
in
practice


if
a
king
is
weak
it
may
be
put
under
direct
attack


pawns
they
provide
the
skeleton
of
a
position


they
move
slowly
and
may
become
blocked
for
many
moves


everything
takes
place
round
the
pawns


different
openings
produce
different
pawn
structures


in
this
way
openings
influence
the
whole
game
pawns
are
the
soul
of
chess

were


the
data
base
also
shows
that
the
overall
results
were
significantly
better
for


what
the
player
does
is
note
the
features
on
the
board
and
formulate
a
plan
which
takes
the
features
into
account


then
the
player
works
out
a
sequence
of
moves


of
course
in
practice
the
opponent
is
interfering
with
the
plan
at
every
step


endgame
the
endgame
or
end
game
or
ending
is
the
part
of
the
game
when
there
are
few
pieces
left
on
the
board


there
are
three
main
<collocation>strategic differences</collocation>
between
earlier
parts
of
the
game
and
endgame
pawns
during
the
endgame
pawns
become
more
special


in
the
endgame
one
thing
players
try
to
do
is
to
promote
a
pawn
by
advancing
it
to
the
<collocation>eighth rank</collocation>


kings
may
become
strong
pieces
in
the
endgame


the
king
may
be
brought
towards
the
center
of
the
board


there
it
can
support
its
own
pawns
attack
the
opponent
pawns
and
oppose
the
opponent
king


draws
in
the
endgame
a
game
may
be
drawn
because
there
are
too
few
pieces
on
the
board
to
allow
a
player
to
win


this
is
one
of
the
main
reasons
for
games
to
be
drawn


all
endgame
positions
can
be
put
into
two
camps


on
the
one
hand
are
positions
which
may
be
won
by
force


on
the
other
hand
are
positions
which
are
drawn
or
which
should
be
drawn


the
ones
that
are
drawn
for
certain
may
be
legally
drawn
mate
could
not
happen
or
drawn
by
chess
experience
no
<collocation>sane defense</collocation>
could
lose


all
in
master
chess
revolve
around
the
borderline
between
winning
and
drawing


generally
once
a
textbook
drawn
position
is
reached
the
players
will
agree
a
draw
otherwise
they
play
on


can
be
studied
according
to
the
type
of
pieces
that
remain
on
board


for
example
king
and
pawn
have
only
kings
and
pawns
on
one
or
both
sides
and
the
task
of
the
stronger
side
is
to
promote
one
of
the
pawns


other
endings
are
studied
according
to
the
pieces
on
board
other
than
kings
rook
and
pawn
versus
rook
endgame


basic
basic
are
positions
in
which
one
side
has
only
a
king
and
the
other
side
has
one
or
two
pieces
enough
to
checkmate
the
