was
named
after
a

opponent
of
the

by
his
a

father


mussolini
father
was
a
blacksmith


before
being
involved
in
politics
mussolini
was
a
newspaper
editor
where
he
learned
all
his
propaganda
skills
and
elementary
school
teacher


at
first
mussolini
was
a
socialist
but
when
he
wanted
italy
to
join
the
first
<collocation>world war</collocation>
he
was
thrown
out
of
the
socialist
party


he
invented
a
new
ideology
fascism
much
out
of
nationalist
and
socialist
views


rise
to
power
and
becoming
dictator
in
he
took
power
by
having
a
large
group
of
men
black
shirts
march
on
rome
and
threaten
to
take
over
the
government


king
iii
gave
in
allowed
him
to
form
a
government
and
made
him
<collocation>prime minister</collocation>


in
the
following
five
years
he
gained
power
and
in
created
the
his
personal
secret
police
force


using
the
agency
to
arrest
scare
or
murder
people
against
his
regime
mussolini
was
dictator
of
italy
by
the
end
of


only
the
king
and
his
own
fascist
party
could
challenge
his
power


fascism
as
practiced
by
mussolini
mussolini
form
of
fascism
italian
fascism
unlike
nazism
the
racist
ideology
that
<collocation>adolf hitler</collocation>
followed
was
different
and
less
destructive
than
hitler


although
a
believer
in
the
superiority
of
the
italian
nation
and
national
unity
mussolini
unlike
hitler
is
quoted
race


it
is
a
feeling
not
a
reality


nothing
will
ever
make
me
believe
that
biologically
pure
races
can
be
shown
to
exist
today


mussolini
wanted
italy
to
become
a
new
roman
empire


in
he
attacked
the
island
of
and
in
he
occupied
the
city
state
of


in
he
attacked
the
african
country
abyssinia
now
called
ethiopia


his
forces
occupied
it
in


italy
was
thrown
out
of
the
league
of
nations
because
of
this
aggression


in
he
occupied
the
country
albania


in
mussolini
signed
an
alliance
with
<collocation>adolf hitler</collocation>
the
dictator
of
germany


fall
from
power
and
death
in
he
sent
italy
into
the
second
<collocation>world war</collocation>
on
the
side
of
the
axis
countries


mussolini
attacked
greece
but
he
failed
to
conquer
it


in
the
allies
landed
in
southern
italy


the
fascist
party
and
king
iii
deposed
mussolini
and
put
him
in
jail
but
he
was
set
free
by
the
germans
who
made
him
ruler
of
the
italian
social
republic
puppet
state
which
was
in
a
small
part
of
central
italy


when
the
war
was
almost
over
mussolini
tried
to
escape
to
switzerland
with
his
mistress
but
they
were
both
captured
and
shot
by
partisans


mussolini
dead
body
was
hanged
together
with

helpers
on
a
pole
at
a

station
in
the

is
near
the

movements
