transgender
is
a
term
used
to
describe
people
who
may
act
feel
think
or
look
different
from
the
gender
that
they
were
assigned
by
society
based
on
their
sex


the
word
transgender
is
used
to
include
many
groups
of
people
who
share
one
important
trait
a
way
of
feeling
or
behaving
but
may
not
be
the
same
in
other
ways


the
common
trait
for
transgender
people
is
that
they
call
themselves
transgender
and
feel
that
their
given
gender
is
not
quite
right


sometimes
the
word
transgender
is
also
used
by
people
who
prefer
it
to
the
word
transsexual


the
picture
in
the
introduction
shows
as
an
example
a
person
at
a
transgender
rally
in
paris


this
person
identifies
herself
as
being
of
the
female
gender
but
she
shows
by
the
sign
on
her
hand
that
she
has
chromosomes


this
means
she
was
born
with
male
sex
organs

pattern


see
definition
because
the
word
transgender
is
used
to
cover
a
wide
variety
of
people
it
is
called
an
umbrella
word


many
different
types
of
people
think
of
themselves
as
transgender


many
different
types
of
people
are
called
transgender


different
english
speakers
define
words
in
different
ways


for
these
reasons
the
term
trans
people
is
often
used


some
common
definitions
of
the
words
used
in
this
article
are
listed
here


these
are
common
ways
but
not
agreed
to
by
everyone
sex
means
whether
someone
was
born
with
a
male
or
female
body


gender
means
whether
a
role
or
way
someone
acts
is
masculine
or
feminine
though
it
can
also
mean
neither
masculine
nor
feminine


<collocation>gender identity</collocation>
is
a
person
sense
in
their
mind
of
whether
they
are
a
man
or
a
woman
or
something
else


binary
or
<collocation>gender binary</collocation>
is
the
common
idea
that
there
are
only
two
groups
a
person
can
belong
in
male
or
female


the
<collocation>gender binary</collocation>
idea
also
means
that
thoughts
and
actions
can
be
classified
as
male
or
female


for
example
if
a
male
child
wants
a
doll
he
might
be
told
that
he
is
acting
like
a
girl


if
a
female
child
climbs
a
tree
she
is
called
a
tomboy


nowadays
in
many
societies
it
is
considered
wrong
to
force
children
into
traditional
gender
roles


these
definitions
are
important
to
help
understand
that
what
people
look
like
outside
sex
is
not
always
the
same
as
how
they
feel
inside
gender


some
people
do
not
fit
well
into
the
<collocation>gender binary</collocation>
idea


people
who
are
transgender
should
be
called
by
the
pronoun
he
or
she
among
others
that
matches
their
<collocation>gender identity</collocation>
so
this

will

and

terms


history
it
is
believed
that
the
century
military
surgeon
james
barry
was
born
a
woman
but
spent
his
entire
adult
life
as
a
man


people
like
those
who
in
modern
western
societies
are
now
identified
as
transgender
or
transsexual
have
been
documented
in
many
cultures
and
for
thousands
of
years


however
only
in
the
last
century
have
science
and
medicine
been
able
to
meet
some
of
the
needs
for
bodily
change
of
trans
people
who
want
to
change
their
body


people
who
have
traits
that
are
different
from
the
gender
they
are
born
with
have
been
accepted
in
some
societies
both
historically
and
now


for
example
some
native
american
tribes
accepted
people
fact
date
april


similarly
a
person
born
with
a
male
body
who
acts
and
dresses
in
a
female
way
is
known
in
the
local
dialect
as
a


fact
date
april
the
in
india
are
born
physically
male
but
live
as
women
including
dressing
and
socializing
as
female


in
the
past
they
used
to
castrate
themselves
and
even
remove
the
penis
in
order
to
urinate
through
a
small
hole


now
with
the
arrival
of
western
medicine
many
choose
to
take
hormone
therapies
and
sometimes
have
surgery
to
change
their
physical
gender


many
of
these
people
still
call
themselves
but
some
now
call
themselves
transsexuals
or
transgender
women


the
role
of
in
society
is
complex
and
varied
throughout
all
of
india


in
western
society
there
have
often
been
people
who
have
chosen
to
act
and
dress
in
a
way
that
was
not
gender
specific
or
was
not
that
of
the
gender
they
were
born
with


this
is
not
the
same
as
being
transgender


cross
dressing
actors
were
very
popular
in
the
theater
of
the
late
century


an
example
of
a
transgender
person
is
the
century
military
surgeon
who
was
known
as
james
barry


it
is
now
believed
that
barry
was
born
female
but
disguised
his
sex
all
his
adult
life


barry
work
which
saved
and
helped
thousands
of
lives
by
improving
treatment
of
wounds
to
stop
amputations
would
not
have
been
possible
as
a
woman
because
as
a
female
he
could
never
have
attended
medical
school
or
entered
the
army


a
century
example
of
a
transgender
person
is
morris
a
geographer
explorer
and
journalist
who
began
life
as
james
morris


as
james
morris
married
and
had
children
but
felt
female
and
eventually
became
morris


<collocation>issues t</collocation>
and
transgender
people
are
not
always
accepted
in
every
society


they
can
suffer
discrimination
violence
and
even
murder


transgender
people
have
fought
for
and
have
gained
many
rights
and
protections
in
some
societies


in
many
places
the
fight
for
transgender
rights
is
associated
with
the
fight
for
homosexual
and
bisexual
rights


together
these
groups
are
sometimes
called
by
the
acronym
for
lesbian
gay
bisexual
and
transgender
especially
since
the
declaration
of
montreal


unfortunately
like
all
political
relationships
this
is
not
always
peaceful


some
transgender
people
do
not
want
to
be
part
of
the
gay
lesbian
and
bisexual
community


they
may
see
themselves
as
straight
heterosexual
and
not
feel
like
they
belong
with
homosexual
people


some
gay
lesbian
and
bisexual
people
do
not
want
to
be
part
of
the
transgender
community


they
may
see
transgender
people
as
strange
or
bad
and
worry
that
the
rest
of
society
will
see
homosexuals
in
that
same
way
if
transgender
people
are
included
in


however
homosexual
and
transgender
people
often
have
some
of
the
same
problems
in
society


so
many
gay
lesbian
bisexual
and
transgender
people
try
to
work
together
to
solve
all
of
their
problems
