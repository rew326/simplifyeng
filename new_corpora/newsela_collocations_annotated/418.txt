history
sir
raffles
founded
raffles
institution
on

making
it
the
school
with
the
longest
history
in

raffles
institution
was

moved
to

the
<collocation>grange road</collocation>

<collocation>symbols institution</collocation>
anthem
school
song
was
written
in
by
e
w
headmaster
from
to


these
are
its
lyrics
when
raffles
held
the
torch
that
cast
promethean
flame
we
faced
the
challenge
of
the
day
to
give
our
school
a
name
the
eagle
eye
and
<collocation>gryphon strength</collocation>
they
led
us
to
the
fore
to
reign
supreme
in
sphere
the
sons
of
singapore
come
heed
the
call
all
and
let
our
hearts
be
stirring
we
do
our
best
the
test
and
keep
our
colors
flying
let
comradeship
and
fervent
hope
with
one
voice
make
us
pray
with
god
to
guide
the
way


although
the
anthem
refers
to
prometheus
and
god
the
school
is
secular


the
inclusion
of
prometheus
is
due
to
the
literary
allusion
to
passing
the
torch
signifying
the
importance
of
education
while
god
in
this
context
is
a
historical
legacy
of
the
school
british
roots

recording
of

the

the

the
top
of
the
crest
means
stability
and
success


the
lower
half
of
the
gryphon
that
looks
like
a
lion
means
that
is
in
singapore
since
singapore
also

the

on

the

by

as

lord
kelvin
the
kelvin
symbol
k
is
the
si
unit
of
temperature


it
is
named
in
honor
of
the
physicist
william
the
first
lord
kelvin


definition
the
kelvin
scale
is
defined
by
a
specific
relationship
between
the
pressure
of
a
gas
and
the
temperature


this
says
that
the
pressure
of
the
gas
is
directly
proportional
to
the
temperature
in
kelvin


this
means
that
kelvin
is
an
absolute
temperature
scale
and
scientists
use
this
scale
more
than
any
other


the
kelvin
is
a
base
si
unit
of
measurement
defined
as
the
fraction
of
the
temperature
of
the
triple
point
of
water
which
is
the
temperature
at
which
water
in
solid
liquid
and
gaseous
state
coexist
in
equilibrium


the
temperature
of
the
triple
point
of
water
is
a
hundredth
of
a
degree
celsius
above
the
freezing
point
or
the
coldest
possible
temperature
is
called
absolute
zero
and
is
equal
to
degrees
celsius
or
zero
kelvin
k


by
writing
temperatures
in
one
does
not
need
to
use
negative
numbers


the
absolute
temperature
scale
was
designed
so
that
a
change
in
temperature
of
kelvin
is
equal
to
a
change
of
degree
celsius
