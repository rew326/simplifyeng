in
near
in
poland


soon
after
his
birth
his
family
moved
from
to


parents
did
not
have
a
lot
of
money
so
started
to
work
before
leaving
<collocation>high school</collocation>


he
wanted
to
learn
a
lot
though
so
he
got
himself
ready
to
take
a
test
to
get
into
grammar
school


he
passed
the
test


he
went
to
the
copernicus
school
in


at
that
place
he
was
shown
to
be
smarter
than
other
people
that
were
as
old
as
him


he
was
put
in
a
higher
class
twice


in
his
family
got
more
money
so
started
to
learn
philosophy
and
natural
science
at
the
university
of
in


after
he
was
done
with
school
he
started
to
work
as
a
chemical
engineer


after
that
job
he
started
to
work
as
a
manager
of
a
factory


at
that
time
he
made
many
new
ideas
about
chemicals
and
things
that
helped
with
those
ideas


he
became
famous
among
people
in
europe
because
of
that


he
also
had
the
job
of
making
new
words
in
the
polish
language
for
technical
things


in
he
wrote
a
book


the
book
helped
other
people
to
learn
the
words
he
had
made


esperanto
and
writing
at
his
school
started
to
want
to
know
more
about
language


because
of
that
he
joined
the
<collocation>slavic literary</collocation>
society
a
group
that
wanted
to
learn
about
the
slavic
language


did
not
only
want
to
learn
about
this
language


he
learned
a
lot
of
other
languages


in
read
the
book


this
book
was
written
by
a
person
who
wanted
to
make
an
easy
language
that
everyone
could
learn


this
language
was
called
esperanto


liked
this
language
a
lot


he
learned
it
then
went
to
warsaw
to
see


they
spoke
to
each
other
in
esperanto


thought
that
books
and
writing
were
important
to
languages


he
thought
that
this
was
much
more
true
with
esperanto


esperanto
was
getting
used
more
so
it
needed
this


so
in
started
to
rewrite
books
into
esperanto
from
other
languages


this
is
called
translation
in
the
early
thought
that
esperanto
was
being
used
by
less
people
than
before


he
thought
that
this
was
because
esperanto
needed
to
be
remade
in
a
different
way


in
though
he
said
that
esperanto
was
good
like
it
was
at
first


he
said
that
all
the
time
after
that
too


was
the
leader
of
the
warsaw
esperanto
society
and
the
polish
esperanto
society
for
a
long
time


in
he
became
the
director
of
the
<collocation>grammar section</collocation>
of
the
esperanto
academy


he
taught
people
a
lot
about
esperanto


from
that
year
until
he
made
classes
for
schools
about
esperanto


he
wrote
something
showing
that
esperanto
was
good
for
learning
other
languages


people
did
not
know
this
at
that
time

while
he
was
there
he
rewrote
from

one
of
the
most
important
things
that
have
been
changed
into
esperanto

fire
is
very
hot


a
person
should
never
touch
fire
because
fire
may
burn
anything
that
gets
too
close


if
human
skin
touches
fire
the
skin
may
blister
which
can
take
some
time
to
heal


if
a
fire
occurs
the
mouth
should
be
covered
with
a
wet
cloth
because
if
too
much
smoke
is
breathed
in
it
is
possible
to
faint


uses
fire
can
be
very
useful
if
it
is
treated
carefully


it
has
always
been
very
important
for
people
to
be
able
to
make
fire
because
people
need
its
heat
on
cold
days
and
to
cook
things


its
light
is
also
useful

be

burn
down
if
fires

every

large
areas

usually
happens
in

firefighters
or
firemen
are
people
with
special
training
to
stop
fires
or
to
keep
a
fire
under
control


fire
needs
three
things
to
burn
oxygen
fuel
and
heat


fuels
can
be
wood
tinder
coal
oil
or
any
other
substance
that
will
easily


once
a
fire
is
burning
it
creates
its
own
heat
which
allows
the
fire
to
keep
burning
on
its
own
for
some
time


controlling
a
fire
can
be
stopped
in
three
different
ways
by
removing
any
of
the
three
things
it
needs
to
burn
the
fuel
can
be
removed


if
a
fire
burns
through
all
of
its
fuel
and
extra
nearby
fuel
is
removed
the
fire
will
stop
burning


the
oxygen
can
be
removed


this
is
called
smothering
a
fire


fires
can
not
burn
in
a
vacuum
or
if
they
are
covered
in
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>


the
heat
can
be
removed


the
most
common
way
to
remove
heat
is
to
use
water
to
absorb
that
heat
putting
the
fire
out


however
some
fires
can
not
be
smothered
such
as
<collocation>magnesium flames</collocation>


they
can
burn
in
nitrogen
and
some
other
elemental
compounds
although
they
can
not
burn
in
<collocation>noble gases</collocation>
such
as
helium


reactions
fires
are
usually
combustion
reactions
that
take
carbon
hydrogen
and
oxygen


fact
date
april
the
products
are
very
commonly
water
and
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
although
there
are
other
examples
that
avoid
this
generalization
such
as
burning
magnesium
in
air
which
makes
magnesium
oxide


fires
can
occur
in
many
ways
and
there
are
many
types
of
fire
which
if
not
treated
correctly
can
cause
<collocation>total devastation</collocation>


there
are
wood
fires
gas
fires
metal
fires
and
more


wood
fires
can
usually
be
put
out
with
water
used
to
absorb
the
heat
but
metal
fires
are
too
hot
for
water
to
absorb
enough
heat
to
put
out
the
fire


if
water
is
used
to
extinguish
put
out
a
metal
fire
the
water
will
simply
evaporate


for
metal
fires
sand
can
be
used
to
cover
the
fire
and
choke
it
off
from
obtaining
oxygen


a
<collocation>fire extinguisher</collocation>
can
put

fires


in
europe
in
the
century
there
was
a
big
change
in

this
instead

protestants
believed

only
way

did
this
so

did
not
have
to
pray
to
mary
or
saints

talks

god

it
also

that
no
one

believed

must
trust
jesus


they
have
to
trust
that
jesus
lets
people
into
heaven


only
people
who
trust
jesus
can
get
to
heaven


this
means
only
worship
god

that
god

a
physician
is
someone
who
practices
medicine
to
treat
illnesses
and
injuries


physicians
go
to
medical
school
to
be
trained


they
typically
hold
a
college
degree
in
medicine


physicians
once
made
house
calls
to
<collocation>treat patients</collocation>
at
home
but
now
mostly
see
patients
in
their
offices
or
in
hospitals


physicians
may
also
work
for
schools
companies
sports
teams
or
the
military


physicians
are
often
assisted
by
nurses
or
other
staff


<collocation>physicians treat</collocation>
patients
by
diagnosing
them
or
figuring
out
what
is
wrong


when
physicians
diagnose
a
patient
they
begin
by
asking
questions
about
the
patient
symptoms
such
as
fever
headache
or
stomach
ache


they
may
ask
other
questions
about
things
like
past
illnesses
or
family
members
who
have
been
sick


they
will
then
examine
the
patient
often
looking
at
different
parts
of
the
body
and
listening
to
the
heart
and
lungs
with
a
stethoscope


sometimes
they
may
need
to
collect
blood
use
an
machine
or
use
other
tools
to
look
for
things
they
can
not
see
when
examining
the
patient


usually
when
they
have
gathered
enough
information
a
doctor
can
make
a
diagnosis
and
then
prescribe
a
treatment


often
they
prescribe
drugs


some
physicians
specialise
in
a
certain
kind
of
medicine


these
physicians
are
called
specialists


they
may
only
treat
injuries
to
a
certain
part
of
the
body
or
only
<collocation>treat patients</collocation>
who
have
certain
diseases


for
example
there
are
physicians
who
specialise
in
diseases
of
the
stomach
or
intestines


other
physicians
are
general
practitioners
or
family
practitioners


this
means
that
they
do
a
<collocation>little bit</collocation>
of
everything


they
try
to
deal
with
as
much
of
a
patient
health
problems
as
they
can
without
sending
them
to
a
specialist


a
doctor
who
performs
surgery
is
called
a
surgeon


other
kinds
of
<collocation>doctors specialise</collocation>
in
treating
eyes


they
are
called
eye
doctors
or


physicians
who
specialise
in
treating
feet
are
called


they
often
give
people
medicine
for
feet
such
as
creams


they
are
usually
found

in
their

buffy
the

is
an
american
television
series


it
is
about
a
girl
who
fought
vampires
and
other
monsters


it
was
written
by

he
based
it
on
the
script
that
he
wrote
for
a
movie
with
the
same
title


the
movie
came
out
in
and
starred
luke
perry
donald
and
paul


the
television
series
has
many
fans


it
was
originally
shown
from
until


the
main
idea
of
the
series
is
the
opposite
of
what
is
the
normal
hollywood
idea
about
horror


in
traditional
hollywood
horror
stories
the
young
<collocation>blonde girl</collocation>
is
always
the
<collocation>weakest character</collocation>


she
is
always
the
one
that
needs
to
be
saved


she
is
often
the
first
one
to
die


in
buffy
changed
that


he
changed
that
girl
into
the
person
with
all
the
power


he
changed
her
into
the
hero


many
of
the
monsters
and
on
the
series
are
symbols
of
problems
faced
by
teenagers

a
horror
movie
