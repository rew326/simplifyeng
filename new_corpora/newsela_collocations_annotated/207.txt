he
went
to
the
table
where
the
score
of
the
symphony
was
lying
and
tore
up

beethoven
stayed
in
vienna
that
year
working
hard
at
an
opera
and
giving
piano
lessons
to
josephine
von
to
whom
he
wrote
<collocation>passionate letters</collocation>


she
was
a
young
widow
with
four
children


it
is
impossible
to
know
quite
what
her
feelings
were
for
beethoven
but
socially
she
belonged
in
higher
society
and
probably
thought
that
a
wild
musician
was
not
a
suitable
husband


in
the
end
she
married
a
baron
but
this
marriage
like
her
first
one
was
not
happy
either


in
beethoven
wrote
his
only
opera


the
next
spring
it
had
two
performances
but
was
then
not
performed
again
for
another
eight
years


beethoven
had
made
several
changes
to
the
opera
which
became
known
as


the
overture
that
he
had
written
for
the
performance
is
now
known
as
and
is
usually
performed
separately
at
concerts


the
opera
is
a
rescue
opera
a
typical
french
kind
of
opera
describing
a
man
who
is
imprisoned
and
rescued
by
his
lover
who
disguises
herself
as
a
man
and
manages
to
get
into
the
prison


beethoven
continued
to
write
compositions
a
violin
concerto
symphonies
<collocation>piano concertos</collocation>
string
quartets
and
chamber
music


two
of
his
greatest
symphonies
were
produced
in
symphony
and
symphony
pastorale


the
first
one
was
known
for
its
dark
and
deep
tone
especially
in
its
first
movement


the
second
was
famous
for
its
depiction
of
the
countryside


he
also
wrote
piano
concerto
and
piano
concerto
emperor


he
earned
money
by
pleasing
the
aristocrats
dedicating
works
to
them
in
return
for
fees
and
by
selling
his
music
to
publishers


occasionally
he
earned
money
from
concerts


it
was
not
a
regular
income


he
would
have
liked
the
job
of
kapellmeister
to
the
emperor


he
was
not
able
to
get
this
but
in
three
rich
aristocrats
the
archduke
prince
and
prince
gave
him
an
income
for
the
rest
of
his
life
on
condition
that
he
stayed
in
vienna


this
meant
that
beethoven
did
not
have
to
worry
so
much
about
money


he
was
asked
to
write
music
for
a
play
by
goethe


the
overture
is
very
often
performed
as
a
concert
piece


beethoven
very
much
wanted
to
meet
goethe


the
two
great
men
met
in


goethe
later
described
beethoven
as
a
rather
man
who
made
life
difficult
for
himself
by
his
cross
attitude
to
the
world


beethoven
admired
several
women
including
one
to
whom
he
wrote
a
passionate
letter


she
is
known
as
the
immortal
beloved
but
no
one
knows
who
she
was


beethoven
seems
to
have
become
deeply
depressed
because
he
never
found
true
happiness
in
love


deafness
in
a
letter
dated
june
beethoven
told
a
friend
in
about
a
terrible
secret
he
had
for
some
time


he
knew
that
he
was
becoming
deaf


for
some
time
he
had
spells
of
fever
and
<collocation>stomach pains</collocation>


a
young
man
does
not
expect
to
become
deaf
but
now
he
was
starting
to
admit
it
to
himself


he
was
finding
it
hard
to
hear
what
people
were
saying


just
at
the
moment
when
he
was
starting
to
become
known
as
one
of
the
greatest
of
all
composers
it
was
a
<collocation>terrible blow</collocation>
to
realize
that
he
was
losing
his
hearing


in
he
stayed
for
a
time
in
which
is
now
a
suburb
of
vienna
but
at
that
time
it
was
outside
the
city


there
he
wrote
a
famous
letter
which
is
known
as
the
testament


it
is
dated
october
and
told
about
his
rising
frustration
at
his
deafness


he
asks
people
to
forgive
him
if
he
can
not
hear
what
they
are
saying


he
said
that
he
had
often
thought
of
suicide
but
that
he
had
so
much
music
in
his
head
which
had
to
be
written
down
that
he
decided
to
continue
his
life


this
very
emotional
letter
was
found
amongst
his
papers
after
his
death


it
was
never
sent
to
anyone


later
life
beethoven
in
by
by
beethoven
had
reached
the
height
of
his
fame


he
was
thought
of
as
the
greatest
composer
by
the
viennese
people
and
he
was
often
invited
by
royal
people
to
their
palaces


it
was
the
year
in
which
he
played
his
famous
<collocation>piano trio</collocation>
op


the
archduke


that
was
the
last
time
he
played
the
piano
in
public


his
deafness
was
making
it
impossible
to
continue


beethoven
had
many
problems
when
his
brother
carl
died
leaving
a
son


the
boy
mother
may
have
been
incapable
of
looking
after
him
but
beethoven
had
to
prove
this
in
a
court
of
law


for
several
years
he
looked
after
his
nephew
but
it
was
a
difficult
relationship
and
it
involved
a
lot
of
legal
letters
and
quarrels
with
people


in
tried
to
shoot
himself


he
survived
but
people
persuaded
beethoven
to
stop
being
his
guardian


went
into
the
army


the
last
years
were
unhappy
years
for
beethoven


during
this
time
he
composed
very
little


then
in
he
recovered
and
wrote
his
last
two
symphonies
a
mass
called
missa
his
last
five
<collocation>piano sonatas</collocation>
and
a
group
of
string
quartets
which
were
so
modern
and
difficult
that
very
few
people
at
the
time
understood
the
music


nowadays
people
think
they
are
the
greatest
works
ever
written
for
string
quartet


his
ninth
symphony
is
called
the
choral
symphony
because
there
is
a
choir
and
soloists
in
the
last
movement


at
the
time
people
did
not
understand
this
either
because
a
symphony
is
normally
a
work
for
orchestra
not
a
work
with
singers


beethoven
chose
the
words
of
a
poem
by
the
german
poet
schiller
an
die
ode
to
joy


it
is
all
about
living
together
in
peace
and
harmony
so
that
it
sends
an
important
message
to
people


this
is
why
it
has
been
chosen
in
recent
years
as
the
national
anthem
for
the
european
union


the
ninth
symphony
was
performed
at
a
concert
on
may


after
the
<collocation>scherzo movement</collocation>
the
audience
applauded
enthusiastically
but
beethoven
could
not
hear
the
applause
and
one
of
the
singers
had
to
turn
him
round
so
that
he
could
see
that
people
were
clapping


beethoven
died
on
march


about
people
came
onto
the
streets
for
his
funeral


the
famous
poet
franz
wrote
the
funeral
speech


one
of
the
was
<collocation>franz schubert</collocation>


schubert
died
the
next
year


in
beethoven
and
schubert
remains
were
moved
to
another
cemetery
in
vienna
and
were
placed
side
by
side


how
he
is
remembered
beethoven
on
a
postage
stamp


beethoven
music
is
usually
divided
into
three
periods
early
middle
and
late


most
composers
who
live
a
long
time
develop
as
they
get
older
and
change
their
way
of
composing


of
course
these
changes
in
style
are
not
sudden
but
they
are
quite
a
good
way
of
understanding
the
different
periods
of
his
composing
life


his
first
period
includes
the
works
he
wrote
in
his
youth
in
and
his
early
days
in
vienna
up
to
about


his
middle
period
starts
with
the
symphony
and
includes
most
of
his
orchestral
works


his
last
period
includes
the
ninth
symphony
and
the
late
string
quartets


beethoven
is
probably
the
most
famous
of
all
composers
and
the
most
written
about


he
had
a
wild
personality
and
this
was
something
that
the
romantics
in
the
century
always
expected
from
great
artists


the
romantics
thought
that
the
artist
was
somehow
a
person
with
exaggerated
qualities
who
was
not
like
normal
people


beethoven
had
a
very
strong
personality


he
lived
in
the
time
of
the
french
revolution
and
had
strong
views
on
independence
and
ways
of
living
free
from
tyranny


this
made
him
a
hero
in
many
people
eyes


his
music
was
so
famous
that
many
composers
in
the
century
found
it
quite
hard
to
compose
because
they
thought
they
would
be
compared
to
him


for
example
johannes
brahms
took
a
long
time
to
write
his
first
symphony


he
thought
that
everyone
was
expecting
him
to
be
the
next
beethoven


it
was
only
towards
the
end
of
the
century
that
wrote
several
symphonies
which
include
singing
although
he
does
this
very
differently
to
beethoven

exploration
columbus
is
often
considered
the
first
european
person
to
have
discovered
the
americas
when
he
landed
in
the
bahamas
in


many
people
doubt
this
for
several
reasons


one
of
these
is
that
though
the
caribbean
is
often
considered
part
of
north
america
it
is
not
on
the
american
mainland


another
is
that
some
believe
that
america
was
discovered
by
the
viking
around
ad


still
others
doubt
the
idea
of
discovery
of
america
at
all
as
<collocation>native americans</collocation>
had
been
living
there
for
thousands
of
years
before
columbus


while
he
did
not
actually
discover
the
americas
he
discovered
the
bahamas
close
to
the
americas


he
was
once
called
the
first
european
to
find
out
because
people
already
lived
at
the
americas
though
it
is
known
now
that
the
vikings
did
this
earlier


columbus
landed
on
a
small
island
in
the
bahamas


the
natives
called
it
columbus
renamed
it
san
salvador
<collocation>holy savior</collocation>


columbus
stayed
on
the
island
for
two
days


he
met
with
members
of
the
tribe
who
were
living
on
the
island


not
knowing
where
he
was
and
always
assuming
that
he
had
reached
asia
the
indies
he
called
them
indians


in
august
of
columbus
left
spain
in
the
ship
called
santa
maria
with
the
ships
pinta
and
along
side


means
girl
in
spanish
and
so
the
smallest
ship
was
nicknamed
that


its
real
name
was
santa


the
biggest
ship
the
santa
maria
was
less
than
long


columbus
sailed
the
atlantic
ocean
because
he
was
hoping
to
find
a
shorter
safer
way
to
china
and
india


he
wanted
to
bring
back
spices
and
gold
for
the
king
and
queen
of
spain
isabella
i
of
castile
and
ii
of


he
knew
that
the
world
was
round
but
he
did
not
know
how
large
it
was


he
had
heard
that
<collocation>marco polo</collocation>
had
found
a
sea
to
the
east
of
china
and
he
believed
that
it
must
be
the
same
as
sea
to
the
west
of
europe


he
did
not
really
know
about
the
pacific
ocean
and
the
americas
and
that
the
atlantic
ocean
did
not
go
all
the
way
to
china


when
he
found
some
islands
at
the
end
of
his
voyage
he
thought
he
had
reached
the
east
indies
when
in
fact
he
had
landed
on
an
island
in
the
bahamas


that
is
why
he
named
the
people
living
there
indians


in
all
he
made
four
voyages
to
america


colombia
is
also
named
after
him


other
facts
about
<collocation>christopher columbus</collocation>
there
is
disagreement
on
where
columbus
came
from


many
people
think
that
he
was
born
in
genoa


experts
have
studied
clues
to
columbus
birthplace
but
no
final
answer
has
been
found


columbus
day
is
a
holiday
that
commemorates
the
landing
of
