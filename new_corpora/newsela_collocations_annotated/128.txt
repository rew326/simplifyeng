weather
happens
because
different

of
the

get
different
amounts
of
heat
from
the
sun


this
makes
different
climates


the
tropics
get
the
most
heat
because
the
sun
shines
straight
down
on
them
while
the
poles
get
the
least
heat
because
the
sun
shines
on

from

low
angle


warmer
air

lighter
than
cooler
air
and
rises
higher
in
the

the
air
always
has
some
water
mixed
with
it


this
is
called
humidity


when
it
cools
the
water
can
change
from
a
gas
to
a
liquid
through
condensation


then
the
water
can
fall
from
the
sky
as
rain
or
snow


after
the
air
rises
it
gets
colder
and
goes
back
towards
the
ground


because
the
air
lost
its
water
before
it
is
dry

it

history
early
history
prior
to

british

was
home
to
large
numbers
of
<collocation>indigenous peoples</collocation>


these
people
for
the
large
part
still
remain
in
the
province


because
has
a
substantial
amount
of
resources
the
native
people
who
dwelled
here
lived
comfortably
enough


the
abundance
of
resources
in
particular
resulted
in
the
creation
of
highly
<collocation>complex hierarchical</collocation>
societies
in

well
preceding

oregon
dispute
see
also
fort
vancouver
oregon
a
map
of
the
disputed
region


the
parallel
is
visible


the
oregon
dispute
was
an
important
factor
in
determining
the
physical
shape
of
british
columbia
and
as
the
political
impetus
for
british
investment
in
protecting
her
lands
in
british
columbia


during
the
middle
of
the
century
the
democratic
party
of
the
united
states
appealing
to
the
public
attraction
to
the
manifest
destiny
a
philosophy
preaching
american
supremacy
and
expansionism
declared
that
the
united
states
had
a
claim
over
the
entirety
of
columbia
territory


this
attitude
was
reflected
even
further
as
or
fight
referring
to
the
end
of
columbia
district
and
the
start
of
russian
territory
of
alaska


this
alarming
attitude
caused
many
in
london
to
fear
that
yet
another
war
in
less
than
a
century
was
brewing


ultimately
however
it
was
resolved
at
the
parallel


british
columbia
lost
fort
vancouver
now
vancouver
washington
and
lots
of
the
gulf
islands


to
this
day
the
oregon
treaty
is
criticized
by
historians
as
being
too
lenient
for
the
americans


hudson
bay
corporation
while
british
columbia
was
technically
a
british
colony
it
was
the
<collocation>private corporation</collocation>
the
hudson
bay
company
that
really
ran
the
place


the
first
governor
of
vancouver
island
then
a
separate
colony
actually
resigned
over
the
fact
that
the
queen
had
no
say
above
the
interests
of
the
colony


after
him
the
next
governor
of
the
island
was
also
coincidentally
the
head
of
the
operations
in
british
columbia
and
vancouver
island


<collocation>gold rush</collocation>
the
first
major
<collocation>gold rush</collocation>
in
british
columbia
started
in
after
gold
was
discovered
on
the
upper
reaches
of
the
fraser
river


the
sudden
onslaught
of
<collocation>uncouth americans</collocation>
lead
to
the
declaration
that
british
columbia
shall
be
a
crown
colony
instead
of
the
region
it
was
after
the
oregon
spat


james
douglas
was
appointed
the
governor
of
the
newly
formed
colony
as
well
as
the
colony
of
vancouver
island
and
for
military
convenience
the
capital
of
british
columbia
was
declared
then
renamed
new
westminster


as
massive
amounts
of
americans
came
fears
that
the
americans
would
try
to
bluster
themselves
another
chunk
of
territory
became
more
and
more
concrete


thus
a
contingent
of
royal
engineers
and
marines
were
deployed
to
new
westminster


to
this
day
the
neighborhood
of
is
known
for
its
history
as
a
site
of
the
barracks
for
the
engineers
nicknamed
the
sappers


subsequent
debt
the
infrastructure
ordered
by
james
douglas
to
support
the
vast
amount
of
capital
flowing
from
the
gold
industry
caused
an
incredible
amount
of
debt
for
british
columbia


by
british
columbia
was
in
debt
plus
an
additional
from
<collocation>various spats</collocation>
with
natives
and
constant
policing
required
to
maintain
law
and
order


even
though
had
a
vast
amount
of
gold
that
was
useless
while
was
in
debt


ultimately
it
was
decided
that
british
columbia
would
with
vancouver
island
forming
one


vancouver
island
would
undertake
the
debt
and
british
columbia
capital
would
be
in
victoria


confederation
with
canada
british
columbia
at
the
middle
of
the
century
had
options
remain
a
colony
of
britain
annex
with
the
united
states
or
join
the
dominion
of
canada


the
option
of
remaining
a
colony
was
undesirable
for
britain
had
long
adopted
a
policy
of
the
little
briton
where
the
key
to
<collocation>economic efficiency</collocation>
and
reduction
of
bloat
was
to
cut
off
connections
to
its
various
colonies


the
option
of
joining
with
canada
was
also
viewed
as
impractical
and
unlikely
to
occur
the
closest
canadian
neighbor
lay
more
than
a
thousand
kilometers
away
to
the
east


for
most
of
the
british
annexation
with
the
united
states
seemed
most
logical


in
fact
the
only
people
who
opposed
this
was
a
set
of
quacks
including
amor
de
cosmos
the
owner
of
the
discredited
paper
the
colonist
robert
a
crackpot
politician
and
john
the
most
creditable
politician
of
them
all


ultimately
however
british
columbia
did
confederate


the
advocacy
of
the
confederation
league
resulted
in
british
columbian
demanding
that
join
canada


on
july
british
columbia
joined
canada


in
return
was
absolved
of
it
debt
which
became
canada
responsibility
and
canada
promised
to
build
a
railway
to
within
years


industry
british
columbia
industry
is
primarily
and
has
always
been
<collocation>resource centered</collocation>


for
large
parts
of
it
history
including
the
entire
time
it
was
a
colony
was
dominated
by
the
big
forestry
mining
logging
and
agriculture
which
have
shaped
british
columbia
culture
and
society


forestry
in
british
columbia
british
columbia
forestry
industry
has
always
been
booming


had
a
bonanza
of
massive
trees
thanks
to
it
location
in
the
pacific
rainforest
region


this
provided
ample
opportunity
for
entrepreneurs
to
build
businesses


massive
sawmills
sprung
up
all
over
british
columbia
especially
in
what
is
now
vancouver
and
surrounding
regions


however
this
required
massive
amounts
of
human
capital
which
was
surprisingly
in
short
supply


to
overcome
this
massive
amounts
of
immigrants
were
invited
to
vancouver
and
places
like
so


this
changed
demographic
makeup
so
much
that
to
try
to
stop
it
the
government
passed
several
acts
to
try
and
limit
the
amount
of
immigrants


however
the
change
was
already
underway
subsequently
became
one
of
the
most
diverse
places
on
north
america
with
people
calling
it
home
from
places
like
asia
europe
and
even
the
pacific
islands


mining
in
british
columbia
british
columbia
large
mineral
resources
also
lead
to
a
large
mining
industry


for
the
most
of
the
century
and
well
into
the
century
mining
was
highly
profitable


for
the
immigrants
once
again
this
was
another
opportunity
to
exploit


large
numbers
of
immigrants
skilled
from
their
experience
mining
at
home
filled
up
the
labor
demands
and
quickly
new
towns
were
formed


the
city
of
for
instance
was
founded
thanks
to
a
large
amount
of
coal
found
in
it
harbor


coal
especially
was
the
fuel
of
the
industry
as
coal
was
required
for
everything
it
the
time
from
ships
to
trains
to
the
heater
in
everyone
homes


fishing
in
british
columbia
thanks
to
location
on
the
coast
fishing
has
been
very
prevalent
in
british
columbia


before
agriculture
had
developed
very
far
in
and
well
before
farming
fish
was
even
a
viable
option
fishing
was
the
only
reliable
way
to
get
food


the
native
people
of
already
had
a
very
active
fishing
industry
with
large
hauls
of
salmon
and
other
creatures
sustaining
them


when
civilization
came
the
fishing
industry
took
off
as
everybody
needed
to
eat
and
there
was
not
enough
agricultural
goods
to
go
around


in
fishing
once
again
it
was
the
immigrants
that
pulled
it
off


mostly
japanese
workers
and
their
families
came


using
their
rich
heritage
of
industrialized
fishing
they
were
able
to
out
compete
every
other
fisherman
that
by
the
turn
of
the
century
the
canneries
and
<collocation>fishing fleets</collocation>
were
filled
to
the
brim
with
the
japanese


only
the
forced
japanese
internment
in
put
a
halt
to
the
monopoly
the
japanese
had
on
fishing
in
british
columbia


today
fishing
is
still
a
powerful
force
although
fettered
by
ordinances
to
prevent
overfishing


agriculture
in
british
columbia
the
agriculture
industry
in
is
and
always
has
been
humble


however
as
they
say
good
things
come
in
small
packages
and
the
agricultural
goods
of
are
about
as
good
as
they
come


due
to
the
fact
that
has
only
about
arable
land
the
remainder
being
too
dry
or
too
cold
or
too
remote
or
a
plethora
of
other
reasons
has
never
been
able
to
sustain
a
primary
food
agricultural
industry


even
today
can
not
grow
enough
food
to
feed
it
entire
population
and
<collocation>imports foods</collocation>
instead
from
the
eastern
provinces
such
as
alberta
and
saskatchewan


however
where
does
grow
food
the
food
is
scrumptious
and


the
valley
is
known
for
it
award
winning
fruits
and
products


however
that
is
not
where
all
the
food
is
produced


in
the
fraser
valley
delta
large
amounts
of
other
food
crops
are
grown
such
as
wheat
and
berries


politics
british
columbia
is
generally
considered
very
liberal


it
premier
is
christy
clark
leader
of
the
liberal

the
provincial
is
