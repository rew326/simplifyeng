someone

kills
himself
in
the
end


the
book
was
very
successful
all
over
europe


people
talked
about
fever


many
young
men
who
were
disappointed
in
love
copied
and
killed
themselves


goethe
most
famous
work
is
a
very
long
play
called
faust


he
spent
most
of
his
life
working
at
it


he
was
writing
the
first
version
of
faust
at
this
time


based
on
a
legendary
character
it
tells
of
a
man
called
faust
who
is
tired
of
studying
and
wants
to
have
the
greatest
possible
happiness


the
devil
called
mephistopheles
in
the
play
tells
faust
he
can
help
him
to
do
this
but
that
in
the
end
faust
must
give
him
his
soul
and
go
with
him
to
hell


faust
uses
magic
in
the
hope
that
it
will
tell
him
everything
about
life


along
with
writing
goethe
was
developing
a
career
in
law


in
he
spent
four
months
in
at
the
imperial
<collocation>law courts</collocation>


here
he
made
new
friends
including
a
young
girl
who
was
already
engaged
to
someone
else


middle
period
arrival
in
until
death
of
schiller
goethe
had
been
and
was
good
at
organizing
and
getting
on
with
important
people


for
eleven
years
he
worked
at
the
court
of
for
a
young
duke
called
august


he
became
a
member
and
later
the
president
of
the
duke
cabinet


he
had
to
organize
projects
and
look
after
parks
and
buildings


he
studied
geology
mineralogy
botany
and
anatomy


he
fell
in
love
with
a
woman
called
charlotte
von
stein
who
was
married
and
had
several
children


he
wrote
love
letters
to
her
and
she
inspired
him
to
write
many
poems


at
this
time
he
felt
that
a
man
task
in
life
was
to
be
useful


the
heroes
of
his
books
at
this
time
were
often
ordinary
people
instead
of
geniuses


after
a
time
he
realized
that
all
his
work
on
<collocation>governmental duties</collocation>
were
not
giving
him
time
for
his
writing
so
he
went
to
italy
for
months


he
loved
the
landscape
and
made
lots
of
sketches
and
he
read
the
ancient
poets
and
books
on
the
history
of
art


he
wrote
a
play
in
rhyme
called
auf
which
combines
the
beauty
of
with
great
poetry


when
he
returned
from
italy
he
settled
once
more
in


he
visited
italy
a
second
time


he
became
great
friends
with
the
famous
poet
and
playwright
schiller


the
two
men
talked
about
many
of
their
ideas
and
helped
one
another
by
<collocation>offering criticism</collocation>
of
their
works


he
wrote
short
works
such
as
which
is
about
life
in
a
small
german
town
at
the
time
of
the
french
revolution


two
works
of
the
greatest
importance
works
occupied
him
at
this
time


one
is
the
novel


this
is
an
example
of
what
is
called
in
german
a
which
means
something
like
education
novel


it
means
a
novel
which
shows
a
person
growing
up
and
developing
his
character
and
learning
about
the
world


this
book
was
a
very
important
influence
on
the
century
romantic
novel
and
on
all
german
autobiographical
novels
ever
since


goethe
spent
many
years
working
on
this
book


the
second
work
of
<collocation>enormous importance</collocation>
was
his
play
faust


he
made
changes
to
the
original
version
putting
all
the
small
bits
together
into
one
great
play


schiller
gave
him
advice
while
he
was
writing
it


faust
enters
into
a
pact
with
the
devil
mephistopheles
who
promises
him
all
his
soul
can
wish
for
fine
living
gold
women
and
honor


he
signs
the
pact
with
his
blood


later
life
napoleon
was
fighting
wars
all
over
europe
at
this
time


germany
which
was
still
made
up
of
lots
of
small
countries
was
an
enemy
of
france


goethe
always
thought
of
napoleon
as
a
hero


his
ideas
about
politics
were
still
based
on
century
ideas


he
hated
war
and
so
he
did
not
take
part
in
politics
but
concentrated
on
science
and
literature


he
wrote
a
book
called
die
elective
which
is
about
a
divorce
problem


some
of
his
scientific
ideas
are
used
in
the
story
as
he
talks
about
the
way
that
two
chemical
compounds
can
break
up
and
form
new
unions


he
compares
this
to
the
people
in
his
story


his
poems
in
divan
are
some
of
his
greatest


he
uses
ideas
from
persia
and
other
eastern
countries
together
with
ideas
from
the
west


it
has
a
lot
of
parables
about
human
life


many
interesting
things
that
goethe
said
were
written
down
in
a
book
by
his
friend
who
published
them
in
a
book
called
conversations
with
goethe


goethe
also
wrote
about
his
own
life
in
his
autobiography
which
he
called
poetry
and
truth


the
book
tells
us
about
his
youth
up
to
the
time
of
his
arrival
in


it
is
in
four
parts


the
fourth
part
was
published
after
his
death


he
chose
the
title
to
show
that
he
was
telling
us
the
truth
about
his
life
but
that
he
had
changed
the
order
of
some
events
to
make
it
into
a
poetic
book


goethe
wrote
a
sequel
a
part
which
follows
on
to
called
the
years
of
wanderings


it
consists
of
several
sections
which
are
like
separate
stories


they
tell
us
about
relationship
with
society
and
how
he
has
to
change
his
ways
to
fit
in
with
other
people


goethe
faust
had
made
him
the
greatest
person
in
european
literature


at
the
end
of
his
life
he
finished
a
second
part
of
faust


it
is
quite
hard
to
read
and
is
more
of
a
long
poem
than
a
dramatic
play


it
talks
of
his
ideas
about
allegory
science
and
philosophy


goethe
died
in
on
march


he
had
started
as
a
great
classical
writer
of
the
century
and
finished
as
a
young
romantic
of
the
century


no
one
else
had
such
a
big
influence
on
art
and
literature
of
that
time

pythagoras
of
was
a
famous
greek
mathematician
and
philosopher
born
between
and
and
died
between
and


he
is
known
best
for
the
proof
of
the
important
pythagorean
theorem
which
is
about
right
triangles


he
started
a
group
of
mathematicians
called
the
who
worshiped
numbers
and
lived
like
monks


he
was
an
influence
for
plato


he
had
a
great
impact
on
mathematics
theory
of
music
and
astronomy


his
theories
are
still
used
in
mathematics
today


he
was
one
of
the
greatest
thinkers
of
his
time


pythagoras
was
born
in
a
little
island
off
the
western
coast
of
asia
minor


there
is
not
much
information
about
his
life


he
was
said
to
have
had
a
good
childhood


growing
up
with
two
or
three
brothers
he
was
well
educated


he
did
not
agree
with
the
government
and
their
schooling
so
he
set
up
his
own
cult
little
society
of
followers
under
his
rule


his
followers
did
not
have
any
personal
possessions
and
they
were
all
vegetarians


pythagoras
taught
them
all
and
they
had
to
obey
strict
rules


<collocation>graphical demonstration</collocation>
of
the
pythagorean
theorem
some
say
he
was
the
first
person
to
use
the
term
philosophy


since
he
worked
very
closely
with
his
group
the
it
is
sometimes
hard
to
tell
his
works
from
those
of
his
followers


religion

important

they
also
believed
that
the
soul
is
immortal
and
goes
through
a
cycle
of
until
it
can
become
pure


they
believed
that
these
souls
were
in
both
animal
and

pythagoras
himself
claimed
to
remember
having
lived
four
different
lives


he
also
told
of

portrait
of
socrates
a
roman
copy
from
a
greek
statue
louvre
museum
for
the
brazilian
footballer
see
socrates
was
one
of
the
greatest
greek
philosophers


he
did
not
propose
any
specific
knowledge
or
policy


he
showed
how
argument
debate
and
discussion
could
help
men
to
understand
difficult
issues


most
of
the
issues
he
dealt
with
were
only
political
on
the
surface


underneath
they
were
moral
questions
about
how
life
should
be
lived


such
is
the
influence
of
socrates
that
philosophers
before
him
are
called
the
philosophers


socrates
made
enemies
three
of
whom
brought
charges
against
him


socrates
was
tried
for
his
life
in
found
guilty
and
put
to
death
by
drinking
hemlock
a
<collocation>herbal poison</collocation>


the
story
of
his
trial
and
death
is
the
subject
of
a
tract
by
plato
which
is
called
the
apologia


most
of
what
we
know
about
socrates
comes
from
the
works
of
plato
who
was
his
pupil


socrates
lived
in
the
greek
city
of
athens


his
method
of
teaching
was
to
have
a
dialogue
with
individual
students


they
would
propose
some
point
of
view
and
socrates
would
question
them
asking
what
they
meant


he
would
pretend
i
do
know
anything
i
just
trying
to
understand
what
it
is
you
are
saying
or
words
to
that
effect


this
is
now
called
the
<collocation>socratic method</collocation>
of
teaching


socrates
is
sometimes
called
the
father
of
western
philosophy


this
is
because
in
the
discussions
he
uncovered
some
of
the
most
basic
questions
in
philosophy
questions
which
are
still
discussed
today


also
some
of
the
people
he
taught
were
important
and
successful
like
plato
and
alcibiades

all
of
what
we
know
about
socrates
is
from
what
other
people
wrote
about
him


our
main
source
of
what
we
know
about
socrates
is
from
the
writings
of
his
student
plato


some
of
plato
dialogues
such
as
the
and
the
are
loosely
based
on
fact


they
are
not
written
records
but
artistic
of
socrates
in
action


another
of
socrates
students
also
wrote
about
socrates


plato
wrote
down
many
of
the
conversations
that
socrates
had
with
other
people


a
person
who
wrote
brilliant
satirical
comedies
wrote
about
him
in
play
called
the
clouds


socrates
was
an
easy
target
for
satire


he
walked
barefoot
and
with
a
swagger


sometimes
he
stood
in
a
trance
for
hours


in
the
clouds
socrates
is
a
crazy
person
who
tries
to
scam
people
out
of
their
money


plato
wrote
that
socrates
taught
for
free


we
do
not
know
if
plato
description
of
socrates
is
accurate
or
not


that
is
called
the
<collocation>socratic problem</collocation>


while
a
lot
of
what
plato
wrote
about
socrates
is
accepted
by
historians
some
believe
that
plato
who
saw
socrates
as
a
hero
portrayed
socrates
as
a
greater
man
than
he
actually
was


some
think
that
plato
was
using
the
character
of
socrates
as
a
tool
to
express
his
own
opinions
rather
than
to
accurately
write
about
socrates


this
is
what
makes
socrates
such
a
mysterious
historical
figure


plato
dialogues
are
works
of
art
finely
written


the
general
view
is
that
they
are
based
on
reality
but
no
doubt
adjusted
for
the
purpose
of
writing


<collocation>biographical details</collocation>
socrates
father
was
a
sculptor
and
his
mother
was
a
midwife
who
helped
women
give
birth
to
children


he
may
have
been
a
stonemason
like
his
father
and
plato
wrote
that
he
served
in
the
athenian
army
as
a
heavy
infantry


we
know
he
was
influenced
by
an
older
philosopher
and
that
he
talked
with
anyone
who
had
interesting
ideas
in
athens
but
beyond
that
nothing
is
known


socrates
was
about
when
he
married
a
much
younger
woman
xanthippe


they
had
three
children
together


socrates
made
complaints
about
his
wife
but
no
one
knew
if
he
was
telling
the
truth


it
is
said
that
one
of
socrates
friends
went
to
ask
the
oracle
at
if
there
was
<collocation>anyone wiser</collocation>
than
socrates
in
athens


the
oracle
said
that
there
was
no
wiser
person


the
oracle
was
well
known
for
saying
things
that
were
ambiguous
or
unclear


it
did
not
say
that
socrates
was
the
wisest
just
that
there
was
no
person
wiser


after
being
puzzled
by
this
socrates
finally
decided
that
his
wisdom
lay
in
knowing
that
he
was
ignorant


his
attempts
to
show
the
citizens
that
some
of
their
ideas
were
nonsense
might
help
explain
his
unpopularity


in
plato
works
socrates
says
he
knows
nothing
but
can
draw
out
other
people
ideas
just
as
his
mother
helped
other
women
to
give
birth


the
death
of
socrates
the
accusations
in
when
socrates
was
an
old
man
three
citizens
and
brought
charges
against
socrates


a
trial
was
held


in
ancient
athens
the
procedure
was
quite
different
from
the
present
day


there
was
a
jury
of
men
drawn
from
the
citizens


both
the
accusers
and
the
defendant
had
to
make
speeches
in
person
to
the
jury


guilt
or
innocence
was
by
majority
vote


there
was
no
preset
penalty
if
the
verdict
was
guilty


both
the
accuser
and
the
defendant
would
make
speeches
proposing
what
the
penalty
should
be


again
a
vote
was
taken


there
were
two
charges
against
him


the
general
theme
was
that
socrates
was
a
menace
to
society


the
first
charge
was
of
heresy
disbelief
in
the
gods


it
was
probably
meant
to
cause
prejudice
amongst
the


actually
socrates
observed
all
the
correct
procedures
of
the
religion
of
his
times


the
charge
had
been
used
successfully
against
another
philosopher


the
second
charge
was
that
he
corrupted
the
youth
with
his
teachings


what
was
meant
by
this


apparently
this
was
not
about
his
personal
relationship
with
his
pupils


it
was
about
the
way
he
was
thought
to
influence
their
political
views


his
circle
had
included
a
number
of
aristocrats
whose
ideas
were
now
rejected
by
most
citizens


the
brilliant
alcibiades
once
a
great
leader
of
athens
was
now
seen
as
a
traitor


the
trial
a
friend
of
socrates
illegally
paid
the
prison
guards
to
allow
socrates
to
escape


socrates
however
decided
not
to
escape


when
socrates
was
put
on
trial
he
gave
a
long
speech
to
defend
himself
against
the
claims
made
by
the
athens
government


we
have
plato
version
of
how
socrates
defended
himself
in
the
apologia


it
starts
i
do
not
know
what
effect
my
accusers
have
had
upon
you
gentlemen
but
for
my
own
part
i
was
carried
away
by
them
their
arguments
were
so
convincing


on
the
other
hand
scarcely
a
word
of
what
they
said
was
true


the
sentence
when
socrates
was
asked
to
propose
his
punishment
socrates
said
that
the
government
should
give
him
free
dinners
for
the
rest
of
his
life
for
all
the
good
that
he
did
for
society


the
court
held
a
vote
between
giving
socrates
a
fine
to
pay
or
putting
him
to
death


the
verdict
was
that
socrates
was
to
be
put
to
death


death
of
socrates
socrates
did
not
fear
death


he
did
not
try
to
avoid
death
by
apologizing
for
his
actions
because
he
thought
it
was
morally
right
to
stand
by
his
principles


socrates
was
ordered
to
drink
a
cup
of
hemlock
a
poisonous
liquid
got
from
the
plant


he
drank
it
and
died
soon
after


plato
on
socrates
trial
and
death
there
are
several
dialogues
by
plato
which
deal
directly
with
the
trial
of
socrates
and
the
period
up
to
his
death


they
are
in
order
of
the
events
apologia
or
the
apology


this
deals
in
particular
with
socrates
defense
at
his
trial


it
is
regarded
as
accurate
in
substance
and
perhaps
in
detail


this
deals
with
the
month
between
his
trial
and
his
death


in
particular
socrates
explains
to
his
friend
why
he
is
not
going
to
escape
or
permit
his
friends
to
bribe
the
jailor


this
is
a
later
work


it
is
written
as
if
by
an
of
the
last
day
of
socrates
life


in
the
work
of
reports
to
a
group
of
friends
on
what
socrates
said
on
his
last
day


this
is
called
in
reported
dialogue
or
one
inside
another


the
is
longer
than
the
other
two
works


the
ideas
of
socrates
socrates
helped
people
to
see
what
was
wrong
with
their
ideas


sometimes
they
liked
this
sometimes
they
were
not
happy
or
grateful


he
said
that
he
socrates
was
not
wise
but
that
he
knew
that
he
knew
nothing


since
other
people
think
they
know
something
but
no
one
really
knows
anything
socrates
claimed
he
knew
more
than
anyone
else


he
said
that
people
who
do
bad
things
do
so
because
they
do
not
know
any
better


people
think
that
socrates
was
a
good
man
because
he
did
no
harm
except
he
asked
questions
about
everything


however
during
his
life
many
people
thought
he
was
a
bad
person
because
he
asked
those
questions
and
because
he
made
young
people
unhappy
about
their
lives


someone
once
wrote
that
socrates
said
that
a
life
that
was
not
examined
was
not
worth
living


this
means
that
someone
must
think
about
their
own
life
and
its
purpose
