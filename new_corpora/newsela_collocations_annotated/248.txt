archaeologists
think
that
people
became
more
organised
in
the
<collocation>bronze age</collocation>
because
the
making
of
metal
tools
was
difficult
and
needed
certain
skills


the
people
who
had
these
new
skills
would
have
been
important


the
new
metal
tools
were
bought
sold
or
traded
across
larger
distances


later
when
iron
tools
spread
the
<collocation>bronze age</collocation>
ended
and
the
iron
age
started


a
reason
for
iron
replacing
bronze
is
that

tin

much
more
rare
than

tools

farming
allows

area

be
supported
by
hunting

crops
can
be
stored
for

to

farmers
could
feed
people
to
do
other
things

this

early
life
and

louis
as
a
child
louis
parents
were
louis
and
anne
of
austria


he
was
the
unexpected
child
of
king
louis
and
anne
of
austria
who
had
not
had
children
in
their
marriage


he
was
christened
louis
literally
gift
of
god


in
before
his
fifth
birthday
his
father
died
and
louis
inherited
the
throne
of
france


because
louis
was
too
young
to
rule
his
mother
ruled
france
with
cardinal
the
italian
financier
who
had
been
the
principal
minister
of
louis


had
guided
the
nation
through
the
later
stages
of
the
thirty
years
war


in
this
war
france
struggled
against
the
habsburg
dynasty
that
ruled
spain
for
military
supremacy
in
europe


<collocation>absolute monarch</collocation>
after
died
in
louis
declared
that
he
would
rule
france
without
a
chief
minister
something
no
french
king
had
done
in
living
memory


he
intended
to
rule
as
an
<collocation>absolute monarch</collocation>
believing
that
his
power
as
king
was
derived
from
god
and
that
he
was
responsible
to
god
alone


he
was
obliged
to
rule
for
the
benefit
of
his
people


while
louis
assumed
responsibility
for
decision
making
he
understood
that
he
must
rule
within
the
constraints
of
the
laws
and
customs
of
his
kingdom


louis
consulted
widely
with
his
nobles
and
ministers
and
he
met
weekly
with
members
of
his
high
council


he
created
an
informal
cabinet
which
was
eventually
led
by
chief
minister
of
finance


nevertheless
the
system
of
<collocation>absolute monarchy</collocation>
emphasized
the
role
of
the
king
and
no
monarch
was
more
successful
in
creating
the
image
of
monarchy
than
louis


he
took
the
sun
as
his
emblem
and
connected
himself
to
its
radiant
image


construction
of
versailles
palace
of
versailles
starting
in
king
louis
transformed
a
<collocation>humble hunting</collocation>
lodge
into
a
glittering
palace


over
men
worked
on
constructing
the
palace
of
versailles
a
project
that
drained
the
<collocation>royal treasury</collocation>
for
decades


expenses
included
not
only
building
but
also
diverting
rivers
piping
in
fresh
water
and
planting
thousands
of
orange
trees
to
mask
the
smell
of
sewage
that
could
not
be
properly
drained
away


in
may
louis
moved
the
capital
of
france
to
versailles
miles
away
of
paris


it
was
louis
motive
to
remove
himself
and
his
nobles
from
the
<collocation>political intrigues</collocation>
of
paris


it
became
a
symbol
of
his
<collocation>absolute monarchy</collocation>


expansion
of
french
power
in
europe
although
louis
dreamed
of
a
spanish
inheritance
for
his
heirs
his
military
policy
was
not
to
expand
french
territory


he
fought
his
early
wars
for
<collocation>defensive purposes</collocation>
to
secure
france
northern
border
and
to
dislodge
the
spanish
from
strategic
towns


louis
fought
the
war
of
the
devolution
to
assert
his
claims
to
a
portion
of
spain
possessions
after
his
wife
father
philip
iv
died


louis
claimed
the
spanish
netherlands
in
place
of
the
wedding
gift
that
philip
iv
had
never
paid


the
french
aggression
in
the
spanish
netherlands
caused
relations
between
france
and
holland
to
deteriorate


the
dutch
had
already
fought
the
spanish
for
generations
to
protect
against
an
invasion
of
their
country


they
had
no
intention
of
allowing
the
french
to
pose
the
same
threat
by
occupying
the
territories
on
their
border


the
result
was
war
in
the
netherlands
from
to
during
which
louis
again
demonstrated
the
effectiveness
of
french
might


in
a
sweeping
campaign
louis
almost
succeeded
in
conquering
holland


to
protect
themselves
the
dutch
opened
their
dikes
flooded
the
countryside
and
turned
amsterdam
into
a
virtual
island


louis
armies
could
not
advance
farther
and
they
began
negotiating
a
truce


war
resumed
however
when
spain
and
austria
allied
themselves
with
holland
and
louis
signed
a
treaty
with
england
in
to
keep
the
english
navy
neutral


neither
side
could
win
a
<collocation>decisive victory</collocation>
and
both
suffered
from
<collocation>financial exhaustion</collocation>
which
ultimately
led
to
a
treaty
to
end
the
war


later
reign
louis
in
the
year
he
revoked
the
edict
of


louis
revoked
or
ended
the
treaty
of


this
treaty
said
that
there
would
be
freedom
of
religion
in
france


this
means
that
everybody
in
france
could
worship
the
way
they
wanted
to


when
louis
revoked
the
treaty
of
he
said
that
all
people
in
france
must
be
catholic


because
of
this
thousand
protestant
workers
left
france
and
went
to
america
england
and
germany


while
louis
ruled
france
became
the
most
powerful
country
in
all
of
europe
and
many
other
countries
copied
the
french
people
way
of
dressing
and
thinking


he
also
encouraged
people
to
explore
canada
and
tried
very
hard
to
make
france
larger


louis
spent
a
lot
of
money
on
wars
and
france
went
into
deep
debt
because
of
him


decline
by
the
middle
of
the
the
sun
king
was
losing
much
of
his
shine


had
taught
him
to
work
rigorously
and
louis
maintained
a
punishing
schedule
throughout
his
life
shrugging
off
a
series
of
minor
illnesses
and
not
listening
to
the
advice
of
his
physicians


eventually
a
broken
arm
put
an
end
to
his
vigorous
horseback
riding
and
gout
ended
his
long
walks
around
versailles


he
was
wheeled
to
the
throne
room
or
carried
to
his
carriage


in
his
first
wife
died
and
louis
secretly
married
his
<collocation>longtime mistress</collocation>
marquise
de
maintenon


in
he
went
through
the
tragedy
of
the
death
of
his
oldest
son
and
the
following
year
that
of
his
oldest
grandson


french
kings
after
louis
taxed
a
lot
of
money
from
the
poor
people
to
try
and
pay
off
the
debt


this
is
part
of
what
led
to
the
french
revolution


legacy
in
a
world
that
regarded
territory
power
and
wealth
as
paramount
louis
was
recognized
as
a
great
king


he
transformed
france
into
the
dominant
nation
in
europe
expanded
its
boundaries
and
left
his
heirs
secure
in
their
possessions


louis
reached
the
height
of
his
power
in
the
and
he
protected
what
he
had
achieved
for
the
next
four
decades
in
the
face
of
a
europe
united
against
him


moreover
he
eventually
realized
his
dream
of
seeing
a
bourbon
on
the
spanish
throne


during
louis
reign
france
also
consolidated
the
administration
of
its
<collocation>colonial possessions</collocation>
and
commerce
becoming
a
world
power


on
the
domestic
front
louis
strengthened
the
central
government
control
over
the
diverse
regions
of
france
incorporating
his
territorial
gains
into
a
united
state


on
the
other
hand
he
provoked
controversy
when
he
restored
catholic
religious
unity
by
revoking
the
edict
of
and
repressing
protestantism


unfortunately
many
of
louis
policies
both
domestic
and
foreign
caused
great
hardship
to
ordinary
people
many
of
whom
suffered
starvation
fled
their
homeland
or
lived
in
terror
of
persecution


ultimately
louis
wished
to
bring
glory
to
france
and
to
his
dynasty
and
he
died
believing
that

the
ancient
olympic
games
was
a
series
of
competitions
held
between
representatives
of
several
and
kingdoms
from
ancient
greece
which
featured
mainly
athletic
but
also
combat
and
chariot
racing
events


during
the
olympic
games
all
struggles
against
the
participating
were
postponed
until
the
games
were
finished


the
origin
of
these
olympics
is
shrouded
in
mystery
and
legend
young

according
to
legend
it
was
who
first
called
the
games
olympic
and
established
the
custom
of
holding
them
every
four
years


the
most
widely
accepted
date
for
the
beginning
of
the
ancient
olympics
is
this
is
based
on
inscriptions

there
is
no
consensus
on

declared
that
