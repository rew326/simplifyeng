occurrence
copper
as

metal
in

copper
can
be
found
as
a
metal
in
the
ground


normally
it
is
green
on
the
outside


most
copper
is
not
as
a
metal
but
in
chemical
compounds


is
the
most
common
copper
ore


it
is
a
mixture
of
pyrite
and
copper
sulfide


copper
is
found
in
small
amounts
in
living
things


some
mollusks
and
arthropods
have
blue
blood
because
they
have
copper
in
their
blood


animals
such
as
humans
and
other
mammals
have
red
blood
because
it
contains
iron


uses
as
an
element
copper
may
be
the
oldest
metal
in
use
as
very
old
copper
tools
have
been
found


copper
is
used
in
<collocation>electrical wiring</collocation>


it
can
also
be
shaped
into
various
parts


it
can
be
used
in
a
heat
sink


the
statue
of
liberty
is
made
of
copper


it
is
also
used
in
pipes
carrying
water
because
it
does
not
corrode


when
people
mix
copper
with
tin
bronze
is
made


bronze
is
an
important
metal
because
it
can
be
shaped
into
useful
things
but
it
was
more
important
before
the
use
of
iron


when
zinc
is
mixed
with
copper
brass
is
made


it
can
be
with
nickel
to
make


as
chemical
compounds
copper
is
important
in
the
human
body


if
a
person
does
not
get
enough
copper
the
molecules
in
the
body
might
not
work


having
too
much
copper
though
can
be
a
problem


humans
get
most
of
the
copper
they
need
from
food
and
vitamins
also
contain
copper
to
make
sure
we
get
enough


copper
compounds
are
also
used
to
kill
fungi
and
algae


safety
copper
is
not
as
toxic
as
a
metal


copper
compounds
are
toxic
though
although
small
amounts
are
needed
to
live


copper
is
expelled
from
the
body
easily
so
it
does
not
build
up
in
toxic
effects


preparation
copper
is
sometimes
just
taken
out
of
the
ground
and
shaped
into
objects


but
most
copper
is
not
in
a
metal
form
in
the
ground


is
the
main
copper
ore


it
is
heated
with
air
to
separate
the
iron
as
iron
ii
oxide


some
copper
i
oxide
is
made


<collocation>sulfur dioxide</collocation>
is
also
made


then
silicon
dioxide
is
added
which
reacts
with
the
iron
ii
oxide
to
make
a
liquid
which
is
drained


now
only
copper
and
sulfide
are
left


the
copper
sulfide
reacts
with
air
to
make
copper
metal
and
<collocation>sulfur dioxide</collocation>


some
copper
sulfide
reacts
with
the
copper
i
oxide
to
make
copper
and
<collocation>sulfur dioxide</collocation>


this
makes
<collocation>impure copper</collocation>


copper
is
made
pure
by
it


a
thin
sheet
of
pure
copper
is
put
on
the
cathode
and
a
thick
sheet
of
<collocation>impure copper</collocation>
is
put
on
the
anode


the
electrolyte
is
copper
sulfate


the
<collocation>impure copper</collocation>
gets
dissolved
in
the
solution


it
then
coats
the
thin
sheet
of
pure
copper


this
makes
the
copper
pure


large
amounts
of
copper
are
recycled
because
of
its
high
value
and
the
increasing
depletion
of
worldwide
copper
reserves

took
an

called

which

to

stark
would
eventually
develop
an
armor
that
he
could
store
in
his
body


this
armor
was
known
as
the
bleeding
<collocation>edge model</collocation>


origin
story
stark
inherited
a
large
american
company
called
stark
industries
when
his
father
died


he
was
badly
injured
by
a
bomb
in
an
attack
planned
by
people
who
did
not
like
him
running
his
company


shrapnel
from
the
explosion
was
moving
towards
his
heart


this
would
have
killed
him
but
a
scientist
called
who
was
with
him
made
a
magnet
for
his
chest
which
would
keep
the
shrapnel
away


in
the
movies
he
makes
an
arc
reactor
which
is
put
into
his
chest
to
stop
the
shrapnel


and
stark
secretly
build
a
heavy
suit
of
armor
which
they
plan
to
use
to
escape


however
during
the
escape
dies
so
that
the
kidnappers
will
be
distracted
from
stark
escaping


stark
escapes
safely
and
goes
back
to
america


he
makes
a
better
suit
and
uses
it
to
fight
evil


personality
tony
stark
is
usually
shown
as
a
playboy


this
means
that
he
has
sex
with
a
lot
of
women


he
is
also
very
proud
and
often
very
selfish


sometimes
he
makes
very
bad
decisions
either
because
he
does
not
think
enough
about
what
he
is
going
to
do
or
because
he
does
not
realize
how
his
actions
will
affect
others


for
example
in
the
comics
he
does
a
lot
of
things
that
he
regrets
during
the
civil
war


stark
is
also
an
alcoholic


he
is
often
