to
have
come
from
the

the
yoga
referred

however
is

it
is

on
the

called

he
taught
that
<collocation>ultimate reality</collocation>
had
three
aspects
vishnu
cit
soul
and
matter


vishnu
is
the
only
independent
reality
while
souls
and

are
dependent
on
god
for
their

this

system
is
known
as

dualism

god

his
view

was
purely
dualistic
in
that
he

between
the

puja

takes
place
in
the
temple


vary
in
size
from
small
village
shrines
to
large
buildings
surrounded
by
walls


people
can
also
visit
the
at
any
time
to
pray
and
participate
in

hindus
also
worship
at
home
and
often
have
a
special
room
with
a
shrine
to
particular
gods


temple
construction
in
india
started
nearly
<collocation>years ago</collocation>


the
oldest
temples
that
were
built
of
brick
and
wood
no
longer
exist


stone
later
became
the
preferred
material


<collocation>temples marked</collocation>
the
transition
of
hinduism
from
the
vedic
religion
of
ritual
sacrifices
to
a
religion
of
or
love
and
devotion
to
a
personal
deity


temple
construction
and
mode
of
worship
is
governed
by
ancient
<collocation>sanskrit scriptures</collocation>
called
of
which
there
are
several
which
deal
with
individual
deities


there
are
substantial
differences
in
architecture
customs
rituals
and
traditions
in
temples
in
different
parts
of
india


during
the
ritual
consecration
of
a
temple
the
presence
of
the
universal
brahman
is
invoked
into
the
main
stone
deity
of
the
temple
through
ritual
thereby
making
the
deity
and
the
temple
sacred
and
<collocation>divine alternative</collocation>
cultures
of
worship
the
schools
the
devotional
school
takes
its
name
from
the
hindu
term
that
signifies
a
blissful
selfless
and
overwhelming
love
of
god
as
the
<collocation>beloved father</collocation>
mother
child
or
whatever
relationship
finds
appeal
in
the
devotee
heart


the
philosophy
of
seeks
to
tap
into
the
universal
divinity
through
personal
form
which
explains
the
proliferation
of
so
many
gods
and
goddesses
in
india
often
reflecting
the
singular
inclinations
of
small
regions
or
groups
of
people


seen
as
a
form
of
yoga
or
union
it
seeks
to
dissolve
the
ego
in
god
since
consciousness
of
the
body
and
limited
mind
as
self
is
seen
to
be
a
divisive
factor
in
<collocation>spiritual realization</collocation>


essentially
it
is
god
who
effects
all
change
who
is
the
source
of
all
works
who
acts
through
the
devotee
as
love
and
light


sins
and
of
the
devotee
are
said
to
fall
away
of
their
own
accord
the
devotee
even
transcended
through
the
love
of
god


the
movements
rejuvenated
hinduism
through
their
<collocation>intense expression</collocation>
of
faith
and
their
responsiveness
to
the
emotional
and
philosophical
needs
of
india


they
can
rightly
be
said
to
have
affected
the
greatest
wave
of
change
in
hindu
prayer
and
ritual
since
ancient
times


the
most
popular
means
of
expressing
love
for
god
in
the
hindu
tradition
has
been
through
puja
or
<collocation>ritual devotion</collocation>
frequently
using
the
aid
of
a
statue
in
conjunction
with
the
singing
or
chanting
of
prayer
in
the
form
of
mantras


<collocation>devotional songs</collocation>
called
written
primarily
from
the
centuries
praise
and
a
filtered
down
form
of
vedic
fire
ritual
are
sometimes
sung
in
conjunction
with
performance
of
puja


this
rather
organic
system
of
devotion
attempts
to
aid
the
individual
in
connecting
with
god
through
<collocation>symbolic medium</collocation>


it
is
said
however
that
the
through
a
growing
connection
with
god
is
eventually
able
to
eschew
all
external
form
and
is
immersed
entirely
in
the
bliss
of
love
in
truth


altogether
resulted
in
a
mass
of
devotional
literature
music
and
art
that
has
enriched
the
world
and
gave
india
renewed
<collocation>spiritual impetus</collocation>
one
eschewing
<collocation>unnecessary ritual</collocation>
and
artificial
social
boundaries

to

must
therefore
look
if
we
would
understand
aright
both
ritual
yoga
and
of
all
kinds
as
also
the
general
principles
of
which
these
practices
are
but
the
<collocation>objective expression</collocation>


introduction
to
sir
john
translation
of
tantra


the
word
tantra
means
treatise
or
continuum
and
is
applied
to
a
variety
of
mystical
occult
medical
and
scientific
works
as
well
as
to
those
which
we
would
now
regard
as
tantric


most
were
written
in
the
late
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>
and
sprang
from
hindu
cosmology
and
yoga


important
symbolism
and
themes
in
hinduism
and
the
cow
many
hindus
are
vegetarians
do
not
eat
meat
because
of
their
respect
for
life


about
of
today
hindu
population
especially
in
<collocation>orthodox communities</collocation>
in
south
india
in
certain
northerly
states
like
and
in
many
<collocation>brahmin areas</collocation>
around
the
subcontinent
are
vegetarian


most
hindus
who
do
eat
meat
do
not
eat
beef


some
do
not
even
use
leather
products


this
is
most
likely
because
many
hindus
have
relied
so
heavily
on
the
cow
for
all
sorts
of
<collocation>dairy products</collocation>
tilling
of
fields
and
fuel
for
fertiliser
that
its
status
as
a
willing
caretaker
of
humanity
grew
to
identifying
it
as
an
almost
<collocation>motherly figure</collocation>


thus
while
most
hindus
do
not
worship
the
cow
and
rules
against
eating
beef
arose
long
after
the
had
been
written
it
still
has
an
honored
place
in
hindu
society


it
is
said
that
krishna
is
both
herder
of
cows
and
protector
of
cows
and
shiva
attendant
is
the
bull


with
the
stress
on
vegetarianism
which
is
usually
followed
even
by
hindus
on
religious
days
or
special
occasions
and
the
sacred
nature
of
the
cow
it
is
no
wonder
that
most
holy
cities
and
areas
in
india
have
a
ban
on
selling
and
there
is
a
movement
among
hindus
to
ban
not
only
in
specific
regions
but
in
all
of
india


hindu
symbols
hindus
use
many
symbols
and
signs


the
two
most
important
symbols
used
by
hindus
are
the
and
the
swastika
hinduism


forms
of
worship
and
mantras
contrary
to
popular
belief
practiced
hinduism
is
neither
nor
strictly


the
various
hindu
gods
and
avatars
that
are
worshipped
by
hindus
are
understood
as
different
forms
of
one
truth
sometimes
seen
as
beyond
a
mere
god
and
as
a
formless
divine
ground
brahman
akin
but
not
limited
to
or
as
one
principle
like
vishnu
or
shiva


whether
believing
in
the
one
source
as
formless
brahman
without
attributes
or
as
a
personal
god
brahman
with
attributes
hindus
understand
that
the
one
truth
may
be
seen
as
different
to
different
people


hinduism
encourages
devotees
to
describe
and
develop
a
personal
relationship
with
their
chosen
deity
in
the
form
of
a
god
or
goddess


while
some
hold
worshippers
of
one
form
or
another
of
vishnu
known
as
to
be
at
and
those
of
shiva
called
and
shakti
at
the
remaining
such
figures
are
perhaps
misleading


the
vast
majority
of
hindus
worship
many
gods
as
forms
of
the
same
prism
of
truth


among
the
most
popular
are
vishnu
as
krishna
or
shiva
devi
the
mother
as
many
female
deities
such
as
kali
and
and
hanuman


worship
of
the
said
deities
is
often
done
through
the
aid
of
pictures
or
icons
which
are
said
not
to
be
god
themselves
but
conduits
for
the
devotee
consciousness
markers
for
the
human
soul
that
signify
the
ineffable
and
<collocation>illimitable nature</collocation>
of
the
love
and
grandeur
of
god


they
are
symbols
of
the
greater
principle
representing
and
are
never
presumed
to
be
the
concept
or
entity
itself


thus
hindu
image
worship
is
a
form
of
in
which
the
symbols
are
venerated
as
putative
sigils
of
divinity
as
opposed
to
idolatry
a
charge
often
levied
erroneously
at
hindus


for
more
details
on
this
form
of
worship
see


mantra
hindus
use
several
prayers
and
group
of
words


some
group
of
words
are
called
mantras


these
words
are
said
to
give
the
speaker
a
<collocation>deeper concentration</collocation>
and
understanding
thus
coming
closer
to
brahman


a
well
known
mantra
is
om
or


it
symbolizes
brahman
and
is
often
the
opening
word
in
many
prayers


to
pronounce
a
mantra
well
you
should
say
it
slowly
and
in
a
deep
voice

are
many
texts

hinduism

said
people
could
not
translate
the

into

because

could

it
took
the

of

to

in

the

was

richard

as

as

author

book
the

delusion
atheism
is
rejecting
belief
that
there
is
a

it
is
the
opposite
of
which
is
the
belief
that
at
least
one
god
exists


a
person
who
rejects
belief
in
gods
is
called
an

atheism
is
not
the
same
as


say
that
there
is
no
way
to
know
whether
gods
exist

not


being
an
agnostic
does

have
to

a

rejects

believes

of

the

of

the

the
argument

they

some

think
there
is
no
evidence
for
any

or
gods
and
goddesses
so
believing

type
of
means
believing

these

in

on

early
papyrus


it
is
usually
written
in
english
as
those
who
are
without
god


the
word
atheism
comes
from
the
greek
language


it
can
be
divided
into
a
a
greek
prefix
meaning
without
and
meaning
god
and
recombined
to
form
without
gods
or
godless


in
ancient
greece
it
also
meant
impious


starting
in
about
the
century
the
word
came
to
describe
people
who
were
severing
relations
with
the
gods
or
denying
the
gods


before
then
the
meaning
had
been
closer
to
impious

the
greek
word
into

this

often
used

side
used
it
to
label
the
other
in
a
bad
way


karen
armstrong
writes
that
during
the
sixteenth
and
<collocation>seventeenth centuries</collocation>
the
word
atheist
was
still
reserved
exclusively
for
polemic
the
term
atheist
was
an
insult


nobody
would
have
dreamed
of
calling
himself
an
atheist


atheism
was
first
used
to
describe
an
openly
positive
belief
in
late
europe
meaning
disbelief
in
the
god


the
century
saw
the
term
expand
to
refer
to
disbelief
in
all
deities


however
it
is
still
common
in
western
society
to
describe
atheism
as
simply
disbelief
in
god
