physical

there
are
two
living
genera
of
elephants


these
are
african
and
asian
elephants
maximus


trunk
an
elephant
most
obvious
part
is
the
trunk


the
trunk
is
a
very
long
nose
made
from
the
<collocation>upper lip</collocation>


an
elephant
uses
its
trunk
to
grab
objects
such
as
food


though
the
rest
of
an
elephant
hide
is
strong
and
thick
its
trunk
is
very
soft
and
sensitive


elephants
avoid
<collocation>acacia trees</collocation>
with
symbiotic
ants
because
they
can
bite
the
inside
of
an
elephant
trunk


teeth
elephants
also
have
tusks


tusks
are
large
teeth
coming
out
of
their
<collocation>upper jaws</collocation>


a
lot
of
ivory
comes
from
<collocation>elephant tusks</collocation>


<collocation>ivory traders</collocation>
killed
many
elephants
so
now
hunting
them
is
illegal


the
trunk
is
also
used
when
it
trumpets


the
elephant
usually
stands
still
raises
its
trunk
and
blows


this
is
a
signal
to
other
elephants
and
wildlife


african
elephants
are
larger
and
have
bigger
ears


they
are
browser
grazers
they
eat
leaves
branches
and
grass


these
big
ears
have
many
veins
which
carry
blood
throughout
the
body


biologists
think
that
the
blood
going
through
their
ears
helps
african
elephants
to
cool
off


the
weather
is
hotter
in
africa
than
in
asia
so
it
is
hard
for
elephants
to
stay
cool


female
african
elephants
have
tusks
but
female
asian
elephants
do
not


african
elephants
have
a
low
place
in
their
back


african
elephants
have
two
fingers
at
the
end
of
their
trunks
but
asian
elephants
only
have
one


indian
elephants
eat
mainly
grass


grass
wears
down
their
teeth
because
it
has
a
high
concentration
of
silica
and
is
very
abrasive


elephants
use
their
teeth
in
sequence
not
all
at
once


this
means
that
at
any
time
they
only
have
one
tooth
in
each
jaw
a
total
of
four


in
total
they
have
teeth
front
teeth
called
and
back
teeth
called
molars


when
the
last
molar
wears
out
the
elephant
dies
because
it
can
not
eat


they
can
live
for
about
years


but
in
a
zoo
or
circus
people
can
keep
elephants
alive
by
feeding
them
soft
food


some
african
elephants
live
on
the
savanna
while
others
live
in
the
forest


today
many
people
think
these
are
different
species


scientists
named
the
forest
group
and
the
savanna
group


uses
humans
have
used
elephants
for
different
things


the
general
took
some
elephants
across
the
alps
when
he
fought
the
romans


he
probably
used
the
north
african
elephant
a
kind
of
elephant
that
does
not
live
today


it
was
smaller
than
other
african
elephants


a
bombay
man
rides
on
an
elephant


people
have
used
indian
elephants
to
move
around
and
to
have
fun


many
circuses
have
them


siamese
indians
and
other
south
asians
used
them
for
several
things


they
fought
in
armies
and
they
crushed
criminals


they
also
did
heavy
work
like
lifting
trees
and
moving
logs


however
people
have
never
domesticated
elephants


domesticated
animals
are
tame
and
have
babies
under
human
control


the
male
elephant
in
heat
is
dangerous
and
hard
to
control


this
state
is
called


most
elephants
used
by
people
are
female
except
those
used
in
war


in
a
battle
female
elephants
run
from
males
so
armies
needed
males


in
the
wild
elephants
have
strong
family
groups


their
ways
of
acting
toward
other
elephants
are
hard
for
people
to
understand


they
talk
to
each
other
with
very
low
sounds


most
elephants
sounds
are
so
low
people
can
not
hear
them


but
elephants
can
hear
these
sounds
far
away

earliest
known
ancestors
of
elephants
evolved
about
million
<collocation>years ago</collocation>


the
ancestor
of
the
elephants
from
million
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
was
aquatic
and
had
a
similar
lifestyle
to
a
hippopotamus


elephants
are
related
to
sea
cows
which
are
large
aquatic
mammals


the
extinct
animals
called
mammoths
were
relatives
of
today
elephants


modern
elephants
live
only
in
warm
places
but
the
woolly

had
long
hair
and
lived
in
cold
places
during
the

buddhism

background
the
buddha
teachings
are
about
suffering
and
how
to
overcome
it


according
to
the
buddha
overcoming
suffering
allows
a
person
to
be
truly
happy


the
buddha
taught
that
if
people
make
good
decisions
they
would
be
happy
and
have
peace
of
mind


the
buddha
taught
that
life
is
imperfect
and
that
we
will
suffer


he
taught
that
we
suffer
because
of
desire
anger
and
stupidity
and
he
showed
that
we
could
end
our
suffering
by
letting
go
of
desires
and
overcoming
anger
and
stupidity


the
complete
letting
go
of
these
negative
influences
is
called
nirvana
meaning
to
extinguish
like
putting
out
the
flame
of
a
candle


the
end
of
suffering
when
one
is
fully
awake
put
an
end
to
one
own
ignorance
and
has
let
go
of
all
desire
and
anger
is
also
called
enlightenment


in
buddhism
enlightenment
and
nirvana
mean
the
same
thing


to
avoid
all
evil
to
do
good


to
purify
one
mind


this
is
the
teaching
of
all
the


buddhism
teaches
and
moderation
or
balance
not
going
too
far
one
way
or
the
other


buddhists
often
meditate
while
sitting
in
a
special
or
specific
way


they
often
chant
and
meditate
while
walking


buddhists
sometimes
do
these
things
to
understand
the
human
heart
and
mind


sometimes
they
do
these
things
to
understand
the
way
the
world
works


sometimes
they
do
these
things
to
find
peace


buddhism
does
not
say
if
gods
exist
or
not
but
one
can
read
many
stories
about
gods
in
some
buddhist
books


buddhists
do
not
believe
that
people
should
look
to
gods
to
save
them
or
bring
them
enlightenment


the
gods
may
have
power
over
world
events
and
they
might
help
people
or
they
might
not


but
it
up
to
each
person
to
get
to
enlightenment


many
buddhists
honor
gods
in
ritual


other
buddhists
believe
the
stories
about
gods
are
just
there
to
help
us
learn
about
parts
of
ourselves


what
is
a
buddha


buddha
is
a
word
in
the
very
old
indian
languages
and
sanskrit
which
means
enlightened
one


the
word
buddha
often
means
the
historical
buddha
named
buddha
but
buddha
does
not
mean
just
one
man
who
lived
at
a
certain
time


it
is
used
for
a
type
of
person
the
equivalent
of
a
prophet
and
buddhists
believe
there
have
been
many
that
there
were
a
very
long
time
ago
and
there
will
be
for
a
long
time
in
the
future


buddhists
do
not
believe
that
a
buddha
is
a
god
but
that
he
is
a
human
being
who
has
woken
up
and
can
see
the
true
way
the
world
works


they
believe
this
knowledge
totally
changes
the
person


some
say
this
puts
them
beyond
birth
death
and
rebirth


others
think
this
represents
the
final
extinction
of
desire


this
person
can
help
others
become
enlightened
too


who
was
the
first
buddha


according
to
buddhism
there
were
countless
before
buddha
and
there
will
be
many
after
him


in
short
he
is
not
the
first
nor
will
he
be
the
last


the
first
buddha
in
was
buddha
the
say
the
first
buddha
was
buddha
however
counting
from
the
present
the
beginning
of
our
present
universe
buddha
is
considered
the
fourth
buddha


the
first
is
buddha
second
buddha
and
the
third
buddha


the
last
buddha
of
this
will
be
buddha


then
the
universe
will
renew
itself
and
from
then
begins
a
new


old
stories
say
that
was
born
around
the
century


he
was
the
one
who
would
become
the
first
buddha
in
written
history


some
buddhists
believe
that
was
a
perfect
person


he
was
born
a
prince
and
was
unsure
about
if
he
wanted
to
become
a
religious
man
or
a
prince


at
age
he
noticed
pain
and
suffering


he
then
wanted
to
learn
the
answer
to
the
problem
of
human
suffering
or
pain


he
gave
up
all
his
money
and
power
and
became
a
monk
without
a
home


he
walked
from
place
to
place
trying
to
learn
the
answers
to
life


at
last
he
found
enlightenment
while
sitting
under
a
big
tree
called
the
<collocation>bodhi tree</collocation>


he
was
the
first
person
to
teach
buddhism
to
the
people
and
buddhists
love
him
for
that


after
died
his
students
taught
the
buddha
teaching
to
more
people


after
a
long
time
they
wrote
down
the
things
that
he
may
have
said


beliefs
of
buddhism
the
three
jewels
main
three
jewels
buddhists
often
talk
about
the
three
jewels
which
are
the
buddha
the
dharma
and
the
sangha


the
dharma
is
the
way
the
buddha
taught
to
live
your
life


the
sangha
is
the
group
of
monks
and
other
people
who
meet
together
like
a
congregation


buddhists
say
i
take
refuge
in
the
buddha
the
dharma
and
the
sangha


this
means
that
these
three
things
keep
them
safe


they
give
themselves
up
to
the
community
and
teachings
inspired
by
the
buddha


four
noble
truths
main
four
noble
truths
the
buddha
first
and
most
important
teachings
are
the
four
noble
truths


life
often
in
fact
almost
always
involves
suffering


this
may
sound
obvious
but
it
is
said
so
as
to
emphasize
that
this
is
the
key
thing
buddhism
is
interested
in


the
reason
for
this
suffering
is
that
we
want
things
we
can
not
or
do
not
have


or
more
important
we
become
attached
to
those
things


for
example
simply
thinking
you
like
an
<collocation>ice cream</collocation>
is
not
a
source
of
suffering


but
becoming
attached
to
that
desire
is


the
way
to
cure
suffering
is
to
stop
the
wanting


of
course
many
could
argue
that
a
better
way
would
simply
be
to
go
get
the
thing
you
want


the
buddhist
response
is
that
we
can
never
get
everything
we
want
partly
because
the
more
we
have
the
more
we
want


the
way
to
stop
wanting
is
to
follow
the
noble
eightfold
path
which
focuses
not
on
changing
things
around
us
but
instead
it
focuses
on
changing
our
own
mind
on
how
we
view
things


noble
eightfold
path
main
noble
eightfold
path
the
buddha
told
people
to
follow
a
special
way
of
life
called
the
noble
eightfold
path
if
they
want
to
understand
the
four
noble
truths


these
are
know
and
understand
the
four
noble
truths
give
up
all
worldly
things
and
do
harm
others
tell
the

mind
keeps

as

way
of
understanding
reality
five
precepts
buddhists
are
encouraged
to
follow
five
precepts
or
rules
that
say
what
not
to
do


the
buddha
taught
that
killing
stealing
having
sex
in
a
harmful
way
and
lying
are
not
signs
of
skill


these
are
the
five
precepts


i
will
not
hurt
a
person
or
animal
that
is
alive


i
will
not
take
something
if
it
was
not
given
to
me


i
will
not
engage
in
<collocation>sexual misconduct</collocation>


i
will
not
lie
or
say
things
that
hurt
people


i
will
not
take
intoxicants
like
alcohol
or
drugs
causing


if
a
person
wants
to
be
a
monk
he
or
she
will
follow
other
precepts
as
well
