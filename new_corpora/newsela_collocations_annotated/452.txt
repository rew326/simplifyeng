band
they
started
to
play
longer
and
more
complicated
songs
and
to
play
at
a
lot
of
colleges
and
universities


soon
they
were
famous
as
studio
musicians
who
loved
to
experiment
with
music


on
the
album
<collocation>atom heart</collocation>
mother
from
they
used
a
brass
band
and
a
choir


they
used
a
lot
of
things
to
make
their
concerts
interesting
to
watch


they
had
a
round
movie
screen
on
the
stage


they
would
show
videos
on
the
screen
when
they
played


they
also
used
lighting
and
lasers
in
a
much
fancier
way
than
many
bands
do


they
also
had
big
balloon
puppets


the
most
famous
is
in
the
shape
of
a
pig
which
first
appeared
on
the
cover
for
their
album
animals


the
pig
has
since
become
a
symbol
of
pink


another
symbol
that
reminds
people
of
pink
is
a
prism
with
light
shining
through
it


this
was
on
the
cover
of
<collocation>dark side</collocation>
of
the
moon
one
of
their
most
popular
albums


the
album
was
released
in
and
stayed
on
music
charts
for
a
very
long
time


millions
of
people
bought
it


the
album
the
wall
recorded
in
was
also
famous


it
was
made
into
a
movie
directed
by
alan
parker
in


that
album
is
important
to
the
history
of
the
group


it
talks
about
the
distance
they
put
between
them
and
their
fans


it
was
the
last
album
they
all
worked
on
together
before
starting
to
split
up


<collocation>roger waters</collocation>
forced
richard
wright
to
leave
the
band
in
but
wright
came
back
in
after
waters
quit


waters
tried
to
sue
the
other
members
so
that
they
could
not
call
themselves
pink
without
him
but
he
did
not
succeed


because
of
this
and
other
reasons
there
was
a
lot
of
anger
and
bitterness
between
waters
and
the
other
members
of
the
band
especially


pink
without
<collocation>roger waters</collocation>
the
last
album
of
new
songs
that
pink
released
is
called
the
division
bell


it
was
made
in
when
pink
also
played
their
last
concert
tour


the
very
last
time
that
pink
played
was
in
as
part
of
the
live
concerts
for
charity


waters
sang
with
the
band
for
the
first
time
since
leaving
the
band


it
was
a
<collocation>big surprise</collocation>
to
many
people
who
thought
pink
would
never
play
together
again
especially
not
with
<collocation>roger waters</collocation>
