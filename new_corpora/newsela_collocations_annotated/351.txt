older


divorced
his

cynthia

married
ono
while
married
<collocation>linda eastman</collocation>


each
wife
had
different
ideas
and
encouraged

husbands
to
depend
less
on
each

later
some
fans
blamed
and
linda
for
breaking

up


loved
his

so
much
that
he
added

so
he
did
that

never
used

unless

from

anthony

a

it
was
easier
to
look

and
get

help
to
look
if
they
stayed
in

ono
and
were
also
hurt
emotionally
by
the
way
ono
was
treated
by
many
people
in
england


some
insulted
ono
and
asked
why
he
was
with
her


on

most
of
the
people
they
met
in

accepted
them

recorded
several

the
one
was
imagine


he
made
many
records
with
ono


on
some
records
they
called
themselves
the
<collocation>plastic ono</collocation>
band


and
ono
worked
with
different
musician
friends
including
starr
jim
harry
eric
and
john


solo
music
was
different
from
his
beatles
songs


he
spoke
more
directly
about
his
own
feelings
and
sometimes
used
harsh
language
or
loud
sounds


this
upset
a
few
fans
who
wished
for
more
beatles
music
from
him


and
ono
were
also
campaigners
for
peace
in
the
world


they
used
famous
name
to
talk
to
the
media
television
radio
and
newspapers
about
their
beliefs


and
ono
were
sometimes
in
trouble
with
people
like
politicians
who
did
not
like
the
things
they
said


president
richard
nixon
administration
even
tried
to
deport
because
of
his
political
views


the
two
things
and
ono
wanted
most
were
to
live
permanently
in
the
united
states
and
to
have
a
child
together


their
lives
were
stressful
in
the
early
for
several
reasons


there
were
the
problems
with
to
the
united
states
and
with
the
search
for


the
public
were
also
sometimes
negative
toward
ono
her
music
and
her
ideas


the
couple
had
<collocation>several miscarriages</collocation>
caused
partly
by
the
stress


also
had
business
problems
because
leaving
the
beatles
was
not
as
simple
as
quitting
an
ordinary
job


the
beatles
had
signed
many
contracts


they
promised
to
do
things
in
a
certain
way
meet
deadlines
and
work
together
to
be
paid
as
musicians
and
songwriters


many
business
deals
had
to
be
finished
or
changed
and
new
deals
had
to
be
made
to
continue
their
music
careers
apart


this
took
time
and
meant
making
many
hard
decisions


the
four
former
beatles
could
not
always
agree
on
what
to
do
with
the
things
they
owned
together


it
took
years
to
work
out
what
to
still
own
in
common
what
to
divide
up
and
what
to
let
go


the
choices
they
had
to
make
sometimes
hurt
their
friendship


and
ono
separated
for
over
a
year
from
late
until
early
because
of
the
stress
in
their
lives
and
their
relationship


each
of
them
dated
another
person
pairing
off
with
may
pang
his
and
ono
personal
assistant
and
ono
with
guitarist
david
and
they
were
nearly
divorced


they
spoke
nearly
every
day
by
telephone
however
and
tried
to
work
things
out


they
decided
that
they
wanted
to
be
together
more
than
anyone
else
could
want
them
apart
and
they
reunited


when
richard
nixon
faced
the
watergate
crisis
in
it
became
more
important
than
pushing
out
of
the
country


the
deportation
case
against
him
was
dropped


won
the
right
to
stay
in
america
in


and
ono
also
finally
had
a
son
that
october


father
and
son
shared
the
same
birthday


and
ono
stopped
making
music
for
five
years
to
be
able
to
spend
more
time
together
and
give
as
much
attention
as
he
needed


they
lived
on
income
from
the
music
he
already
made


ono
became
business
manager
and
invested
his
money
in

and

farming

was

was
proud
to
call
himself
a
househusband


they
also
visited
ono
family
in
japan
several
times
and
made
other
trips


in
and
ono
began
to
write
new
music
as
got
old
enough
to
begin
school


they
recorded
a
new
album
titled
double
fantasy
that
year


a
single
from
the
album
just
like
starting
over
was
a
hit
and
people
welcomed
back


even
people
who
had
not
liked
ono
earlier
now
respected
her
and
more

edison
with
phonograph


edison
is
considered
one
of
the
most
prolific
inventors
in
history
holding
patents
in
his
name
an
invention
is
a
new
thing
that
someone
has
made


the
computer
was
an
invention
when
it
was
first
made


we
say
when
it
was
invented


new
things
that
are
made
or
created
are
called
inventions


the
car
is
an
invention
that
everyone
knows


ideas
are
also
called
inventions


writers
can
invent
characters
and
then
invent
a
story
about
them


inventions
are
made
by
inventors


inventing
over
time
humans
have
invented
objects
which
make
life
easier
for
themselves


because
of
this
a
quote
necessity
is
the
mother
of
invention
was
written


the
quote
means
that
a
lack
of
something
should
inspire
someone
to
create
something
to
fill
that
empty
space


however
not
all
people
believe
that
this
is
true


they
think
that
too
much
of
something
can
lead
to
an
invention


many
inventions
are
just
a
variation
of
something
that
already
exists

the
origin
of
the
word
<collocation>genocide genocide</collocation>
is
the
crime
of
killing
many
people
who
are
all
part
of
one
ethnic
or
religious
group
or
some
sort
of
similar
group
and
trying
to
destroy
that
group


genocide
is
done
usually
by
a
group
such
as
a
government
or
military
group
not
by
one
person
or
a
small
number
of
people


usually
the
motivation
for
genocide
is
based
on
political
reasons


it
is
generally
frowned
upon
as
a
way
to
get
rid
of
an
ethnic
group
no
matter
how
annoying
that
ethnic
group
may
be


the
word
genocide
was
made
up
by
raphael
a
polish
jew
in
from
the
words
greek
for
family
tribe
or
race
and
from
the
latin
to
kill


it
was
first
used
to
the
nazi
holocaust
when
many
groups
including
jews
and
others
were
killed


of
are
another
example
of
horror


about
a
million
of
were
killed
in
in
concentration
camps


another
example
of
genocide
was
when
about
a
million
of
the
group
of
people
of
were
killed
along
with
who
were
against
the
genocide
in


in
made
a
speech
to
the
legal
council
of
the
league
of
nations
conference
on
international
criminal
law
in
madrid
for
which
he
prepared
an
essay
on
the
crime
of
barbarity
as
a
crime
against
international
law


the
purpose
of
the
crime
which
later
evolved
into
the
idea
of
genocide
was
based
mostly
on
the
experience
of
assyrians
massacred
in
iraq
on
august


the
event
in
iraq
reminded
him
of
earlier
similar
events
of
the
<collocation>armenian genocide</collocation>
during
<collocation>world war</collocation>
i


today
any
genocide
is
prohibited
by
the
genocide
convention
and
actor
or
of
genocide
is
judged
by
the
international
<collocation>criminal court</collocation>
