infection
is

many
kinds
of
<collocation>infectious agents</collocation>
viruses

these
four
kinds
of
<collocation>infectious agents</collocation>
cause

for

some

getting
infectious
disease
some
diseases
can
be
passed
from
one
person
to
another
easily


other
<collocation>infectious diseases</collocation>
are
harder
to
get


if
a
person
kiss
or
touches
another
person
who
is
infected
with
the
flu
a
cold
measles
or
a
sore
throat
he
or
she
may
get
their
disease


they
may
also
give
the
person
their
disease
if
they
cough
on
them


other
medical
conditions
such
as
aids
herpes
and
<collocation>hepatitis b</collocation>
are
only
passed
by
closer
contact


having
sex
with
an
infected
person
<collocation>blood transfusions</collocation>
or
touching
their
blood
or
urine
can
sometimes
pass
on
these
conditions
or
diseases


stopping
infectious
disease
people
can
stop
disease
by
covering
the
mouth
every
time
during
cough
ing
only
drinking
clean
water
only
eating
very
cooked
meat
using
a
condom
during
sex
treating
infectious
disease
bacteria
are
usually
treated
with
antibiotic
medicines
like
tetracycline
and
penicillin


viruses
will
not
be
killed
by
antibiotics


they
must
be
treated
with
special
medicines
called
antivirals


medicines
to
treat
like
are
antivirals


like
and
treat
infections
from
fungus


medicines
like
and


some
<collocation>infectious diseases</collocation>
have
no
treatments
that
work
well


for
example
there
is
no
medicine
that
works
well
to
cure
west
<collocation>nile virus</collocation>
and
rabies


so
it
is
important
to
avoid
getting
these
diseases


some
infectious
disease
goes
away
on
its
own


these
mild
diseases
do
not
need
to
be
treated


for
example
colds
are
caused
by
viruses
and
they
do
not
need
medicines


some
diseases
can
be
prevented
by
immunizations


immunizations
try
to
make
a
person
have
an
immune
reaction
to
an
infectious
agent


this
is
usually
done
before
the
person
gets
the
disease


examples
of
diseases
prevented
by
immunizations
are
polio
tetanus
and


in
some
cases
if
all
of
the
disease
can
be
removed
from
society
we
can
get
rid
of
the
disease
completely


an
example
of
this
is
smallpox


this
virus
used
to
kill
people
cause
blindness
and
bad
scars


now
there
has
not
been
a
person
who
had
smallpox
in
over
thirty
years

by

the

the

continues


when

a

the
number
shows
how

are

fishermen

is
catching
fish
either
for
fun
or
so
they
can
be
eaten


there
are
many
different
types
of
fishing
the
goal
of
fishing
for

is
to
catch
or
<collocation>harvest seafood</collocation>
either
fish
or
other

can
be
done
in

for

fishing
for
money
is
a
very
dangerous
job
because
people
can
die
or
be
badly
hurt


fishing
gives
a
lot
of
food
to
many
countries
around
the
world
but
those
who
take
it
as
a
job
must
often
go
far
into
the
ocean
under
bad
conditions


commercial
fishermen
get
many
kinds
of
sea
animals


this
includes
fish
such
as
tuna
cod
and
salmon
as
well
as
invertebrates
such
as
shrimp
lobster
clams
and
squid


alaskan
king
<collocation>crab fishing</collocation>
is
a
famous
example


ways
to
fish
for
money
have
become
very
simple
using
large
nets
and
machines
to
catch
the
animals


many
countries
have
made
rules
limiting
how
much
fish
people
can
catch
because
some
kinds
have
become
scarce


raising
fish
in
the
forms
of
and
add
to
the
catch
of
fish


fishing
for
fun
fishing
for
fun
is
normally
done
with
a
fishing
rod
and
line
with
any
number
of
hooks
to
get
the
fish


this
is
something
called
angling


there
may
be
rules
that
say
how
many
lines
and
hooks
one
fisherman
can
use
and
how
many
fish
he
can
catch


popular
kinds
of
fish
people
get
for
fun
in
fresh
water
include
black
bass
black
bass
includes
the
entire
range
of
bass
fish
pike
perch
carp
trout
salmon
and
sunfish


fish
people
get
in
saltwater
include
swordfish
marlin
tuna
and
others


rules
generally
do
not
allow
the
use
of
nets
and
catching
fish
with
hooks
not
in
the
mouth


however
some
kinds
of
fish
can
be
taken
with
nets
for
bait
and
a
few
for
food


fish
that
are
not
said
to
be
worth
as
much
can
sometimes
be
taken
by
many
ways
like
snagging
bow
and
arrow
or
even
gun
because
they
are
seen
as
competing
with
more
valuable
fish


<collocation>recreational fishing</collocation>
laws
also
include
other
life
that
lives
in
water
such
as
frogs
and
turtles


sport
fishing
is
a
recent
popular
way
of
<collocation>recreational fishing</collocation>
where
fishermen
try
to
get
more
fish
than
other
fishermen


this
sport
came
from
local
<collocation>fishing contests</collocation>
into
a
large
contest
in
the
where
skilled
fishermen
can
compete
and
be

out

other
large
contests
around

we
see
a
lot
of
words
related
with
the
names
of
fish
and
fishing
tools


these
words
may
be
unknown
to
the

the
teacher
should
give
their
translation
or
show
their
pictures


if
learners
see
the
pictures

it
will
be

for

catch
and

fishing
is
increasingly
practiced
especially
by
fly
fishermen
as
well
as
spin
and
bait
casting
fishermen
to
increase
conservation
and
to
protect
rare
fish
such


the
practice
is
however
disputed
as
it
by
some
is
considered
unethical
to
perform
<collocation>painful actions</collocation>
to
the
fish
for
fun
and
not
for
the
reason
of
food
production


because
of
this
practice
is
illegal
in
norway


people
catch
fish
but
not
always
for
food
sometimes
for
entertainment


first
of
all
the
teacher
should
explain
to
his
learners
the
importance
of
fish
and
other
seafood
for
people


while
presenting
this
text
first
teacher
must
know
if
the
learners
know
fish
producing
countries
or
the
seas
rivers
lakes
that
these
types
of
fish
live
because
here
the
country
norway
is
mentioned
maybe
the
learners
do
know
this
country


the
teacher
may
ask
the
learners
which
words
are
unknown
for
them


first
they
have
to
guess
the
meaning
of
these
words
to
the
context
but
if
it
not
possible
the
teacher
give
the
translation


firstly
i
explain
my
learners
why
people
do
and
release
its
harm
and
benefit
for
people
i
also
speak
when
it
is

to

it
is

can
also

in
ways
that
do
not

them
such
as
in

for

in

may
ask
what
is
aquarium
used
for
and
if
they
had
seen
it
anywhere


after

reply
can
tell
that
there
are
very
big

usually
keep
there

in

to

to
the

the
past

been
so
good
for
getting
money
that

began
overfishing
fishing
too
much
a
serious
problem
that
does
lots
of
damage
bad


overfishing
does
not
always
mean
extinction
but
simply
that
a
fish
type
has
been
harvested
so
that
there
can
not
be
as
many
of
that
kind
of
fish
as
before


as
more
boats
are
sent
out
to
catch
the
fish
many
population
levels
of
a
type
of
fish
can
drop


then
there
are
not
enough
of
that
kind
of
fish
left
to
have
new
kinds
of
fish


many
times
<collocation>fishing boats</collocation>

they
do
not

all
kinds

can

after
they
have
died


drift

fishing
sometimes
catches
creatures
like
seals

and

this
kind
of

made
people
complain

was
guessed
that

government


the
constitution
was
similar
to

of

it
emphasized
