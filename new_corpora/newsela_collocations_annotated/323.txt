has
psoriasis
psoriasis
is
a
skin
condition
where
cells
grow
at
a
faster
rate
than
they
can
be
shed
causing
excess
skin
to
build
up
and
form
scaly
patches
on
the
body


the
condition
it
appears
to
be
a
buildup
of
dry
skin
on
your
body


you
can
have
it
at
any
age
but
normally
as
you
get
older


it
starts
with
the
skin
cracking
as
a
paper
cut
on
your
fingertips


this
skin
would
begin
to
die
flake
peal
and
itch


as
your
itch
the
area
it
begins
to
get
red
and
then
it
begins
to
blister
like
flake
and
to
raw
skin


it
appears
most
often
on
hands
toes
inside
arch
of
your
feet
and
on
you
heals


it
is
also
shows
up
in
callus
by
cracking


when
washing
hands
it
has
a
burning
effect


living
in
moist
humid
climate
appears
to
delay
the
condition
for
appearing


dry
arid
climates
seem
to
aggravate
the
condition


washing
your
hands
has
a
drying
affect
which
triggers
the
condition


when
washing
water
removes
oils
from
our
body
and
has
a
drying
effect
on
our
hands


washing
with
psoriasis
removes
the
dry
skin
but
then
the
skin
underneath
is
raw


hard
water
appears
to
worsen
the
condition
in
dry
climates
but
not
as
much
in
