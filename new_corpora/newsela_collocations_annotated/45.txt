it
is
not
certain
that
the
object
is
really
a
flute


the
item
in
question
is
a
fragment
of
the
femur
of
a
young
cave
bear
and
has
been
dated
to
about
<collocation>years ago</collocation>


however
whether
it
is
truly
a
musical
instrument
or
simply
a
bone
is
a
matter
of
<collocation>ongoing debate</collocation>


in
archaeologists
discovered
a
bone
flute
in
the
fels
cave
near
germany


the
flute
has
a
mouthpiece
and
is
made
from
a
vulture
wing
bone


the
researchers
involved
in
the
discovery
officially
published
their
findings
in
the
journal
nature
in
june


the
discovery
is
also
the
oldest
confirmed
find
of
any
musical
instrument
in
history


other
flutes
were
also
found
in
the
cave


this
flute
was
found
next
to
the
venus
of
fels
and
a
short
distance
from
the
oldest
known
human
carving


when
they
announced
their
discovery
the
scientists
suggested
that
the
finds
demonstrate
the
presence
of
a
musical
tradition
at
the
time
when
modern
humans
colonized
europe


the
oldest
known
wooden
pipes
were
discovered
near
ireland
in


a
pit
contained
a
group
of
six
flutes
made
from
<collocation>yew wood</collocation>
between
and
cm
long
tapered
at
one
end
but
without
any
finger
holes


they
may
once
have
been
strapped
together


in
several
bone
flutes
were
found
in
in
province
china


they
date
to
about


they
have
between
and
holes
each
and
were
made
from
the
hollow
bones
of
a
bird
the
crane


at
the
time
of
the
discovery
one
was
found
to
be
still
playable


the
bone
flute
plays
both
the
five

ancient
times
it
is
not
known
what
the
earliest
music
of
the
cave
people
was
like


some
architecture
even
some
paintings
are
thousands
of
years
old
but
old
music
could
not
survive
until
people
learned
to
write
it
down


the
only
way
we
can
guess
about
early
music
is
by
looking
at
very
old
paintings
that
show
people
playing
musical
instruments
or
by
finding
them
in
archaeological
digs
digging
under
the
ground
to
find
old
things


the
earliest
piece
of
music
that
was
ever
written
down
and
that
has
not
been
lost
was
discovered
on
a
tablet
written
in
a
language
spoken
in
and
around
northern
mesopotamia
where
iraq
is
today
from
about


<collocation>middle ages</collocation>
another
early
piece
of
written
music
that
has
survived
was
a
round
called
is
in


it
was
written
down
by
a
monk
around
the
year


much
of
the
music
in
the
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>
roughly
was
folk
music
played
by
working
people
who
wanted
to
sing
or
dance


when
people
played
instruments
they
were
usually
playing
for
dancers


however
most
of
the
music
that
was
written
down
was
for
the
catholic
church


this
music
was
written
for
monks
to
sing
in
church


it
is
called
chant
or
<collocation>gregorian chant</collocation>


renaissance
in
the
renaissance
roughly
there
was
a
lot
of
music
and
many
composers
wrote
music
that
has
survived
so
that
it
can
be
performed
played
or
sung
today


the
name
for
this
period
renaissance
is
a
french
word
which
means
rebirth


this
period
was
called
the
rebirth
because
many
new
types
of
art
and
music
were
reborn
during
this
time


some
very
beautiful
music
was
written
for
use
in
church
services
sacred
music
by
the
italian
composer
da


in
music
many
singers
sing
together
this
is
called
a
choir


there
was
also
plenty
of
music
not
written
for
the
church
such
as
happy
dance
music
and
romantic
love
songs


popular
instruments
during
the
renaissance
included
the
a
string
instrument
played
with
a
bow
lutes
a
plucked
<collocation>stringed instrument</collocation>
that
is
a
little
like
a
guitar
and
the
virginal
a
small
quiet
<collocation>keyboard instrument</collocation>


baroque
in
the
arts
the
baroque
was
a
western
cultural
era
which
began
near
the
turn
of
the
century
in
rome


it
was
exemplified
by
drama
and
grandeur
in
sculpture
painting
literature
dance
and
music


in
music
the
term
baroque
applies
to
the
final
period
of
dominance
of
imitative
counterpoint
where
different
voices
and
instruments
echo
each
other
but
at
different
pitches
sometimes
inverting
the
echo
and
even
reversing
<collocation>thematic material</collocation>


the
popularity
and
success
of
the
baroque
style
was
encouraged
by
the
roman
catholic
church
which
had
decided
at
the
time
of
the
council
of
that
the
arts
should
communicate
religious
themes
in
direct
and
<collocation>emotional involvement</collocation>


the
upper
class
also
saw
the
dramatic
style
of
baroque
architecture
and
art
as
a
means
of
impressing
visitors
and
expressing
triumphant
power
and
control


<collocation>baroque palaces</collocation>
are
built
around
an
entrance
of
courts
grand
staircases
and
<collocation>reception rooms</collocation>
of
sequentially
increasing
opulence


in
similar
of
detail
art
music
architecture
and
literature
inspired
each
other
in
the
baroque
cultural
movement
as
artists
explored
what
they
could
create
from
repeated
and
varied
patterns


some
traits
and
aspects
of
baroque
paintings
that
differentiate
this
style
from
others
are
the
abundant
amount
of
details
often
bright
less
<collocation>realistic faces</collocation>
of
subjects
and
an
overall
sense
of
awe
which
was
one
of
the
goals
in
baroque
art


the
word
baroque
probably
derives
from
the
ancient
portuguese
noun
which
is
a
pearl
that
is
not
round
but
of
unpredictable
and
elaborate
shape


hence
in
informal
usage
the
word
baroque
can
simply
mean
that
something
is
elaborate
with
many
details
without
reference
to
the
baroque
styles
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries


classical
period
in
western
music
the
classical
period
means
music
from
about
to


it
was
the
time
of
composers
like
joseph
haydn
mozart
and
ludwig
van
beethoven


orchestras
became
bigger
and
composers
often
wrote
longer
pieces
of
music
called
symphonies
that
had
several
sections
called
movements


some
movements
of
a
symphony
were
loud
and
fast
other
movements
were
quiet
and
sad


the
form
of
a
piece
of
music
was
very
important
at
this
time


music
had
to
have
a
nice
shape


they
often
used
a
structure
which
was
called
sonata
form


another
important
type
of
music
was
the
string
quartet
which
is
a
piece
of
music
written
for
two
violins
a
viola
and
a
violoncello


like
symphonies
string
quartet
music
had
several
sections


haydn
mozart
and
beethoven
each
wrote
many
famous
string
quartets


the
piano
was
invented
during
this
time


composers
liked
the
piano
because
it
could
be
used
to
play
dynamics
getting
louder
or
getting
softer


other
popular
instruments
included
the
violin
the
violoncello
the
flute
the
clarinet
and
the
oboe


romantic
period
the
century
is
called
the
romantic
period


composers
were
particularly
interested
in
conveying
their
emotions
through
music


an
important
instrument
from
the
romantic
period
was
the
piano


some
composers
such
as
chopin
wrote
subdued
expressive
quietly
emotional
piano
pieces


often
music
described
a
feeling
or
told
a
story
using
sounds


other
composers
such
as
<collocation>franz schubert</collocation>
wrote
songs
for
a
singer
and
a
piano
player
called
lied
the
german
word
for
song


these
lieder
plural
of
lied
told
stories
by
using
the
lyrics
words
of
the
song
and
by
the
<collocation>imaginative piano</collocation>


other
composers
like
richard
strauss
and
<collocation>franz liszt</collocation>
created
narratives
and
told
stories
using
only
music
which
is
called
a
tone
poem


composers
such
as
<collocation>franz liszt</collocation>
and
johannes
brahms
used
the
piano
to
play
loud
dramatic
strongly
emotional
music


many
composers
began
writing
music
for
bigger
orchestras
with
as
many
as
instruments


it
was
the
period
of
nationalism
the
feeling
of
being
proud
of
one
country
when
many
composers
made
music
using
folksong
or
melodies
from
their
country


lots
of
famous
composers
lived
at
this
time
such
as
<collocation>franz schubert</collocation>
felix
mendelssohn
chopin
johannes
brahms
tchaikovsky
and
richard
wagner


modern
times
from
about
onwards
is
called
the
modern
period


many
century
composers
wanted
to
compose
music
that
sounded
different
from
the
classical
and
romantic
music


modern
composers
searched
for
new
ideas
such
as
using
new
instruments
different
forms
different
sounds
or
different
harmonies


the
composer
arnold
wrote
pieces
which
were
atonal
meaning
that
they
did
not
sound
as
if
they
were
in
any
clear
musical
key


later
invented
a
new
system
for
writing
music
called
system


music
written
with
the
system
sounds
strange
to
some
but
is
mathematical
in
nature
often
making
sense
only
after
careful
study


pure
music
was
popular
among
academics
in
the
fifties
and
sixties
but
some
composers
such
as
benjamin
britten
use
it
today
when
it
is
necessary
to
get
a
certain
feel


one
of
the
most
important
composers
stravinsky
wrote
music
with
very
complicated
difficult
chords
groups
of
notes
that
are
played
together
and
rhythms


some
composers
thought
music
was
getting
too
complicated
and
so
they
wrote
<collocation>minimalist pieces</collocation>
which
use
very
simple
ideas


in
the
and
composers
such
as
experimented
with
electronic
music
using
electronic
circuits
amplifiers
and
loudspeakers


in
the
composers
began
using
<collocation>electronic synthesizers</collocation>
and
musical
instruments
from
rock
and
roll
music
such
as
the
electric
guitar


they
used
these
new
instruments
to
make
new
sounds


composers
writing
in
the
and
the
such
as
john
adams
born
and
james
born
often
use
a
mixture
of
all
these
ideas
but
they
like
to
write
tonal
music
with
easy
tunes
as
well


electronic
music
music
can
be
produced
electronically


this
is
most
commonly
done
by
computers
keyboards
<collocation>electric guitars</collocation>
and
<collocation>disk tables</collocation>


they
can
mimic
traditional
instruments
and
also
produce
very
different
sounds


electronic
music
is
commonly
made
with
computer
programs
and
hardware
mixers


jazz
jazz
is
a
type
of
music
that
was
invented
around
in
new
orleans
in
the
south
of
the
usa


there
were
many
black
musicians
living
there
who
played
a
style
of
music
called
blues
music


blues
music
was
influenced
by
african
music
because
the
black
people
in
the
united
states
had
come
to
the
united
states
as
slaves


they
were
taken
from
africa
by
force


blues
music
was
a
music
that
was
played
by
singing
using
the
harmonica
or
the
<collocation>acoustic guitar</collocation>


many
blues
songs
had
sad
lyrics
about
sad
emotions
feelings
or
sad
experiences
such
as
losing
a
job
a
family
member
dying
or
having
to
go
to
jail
prison


jazz
music
mixed
together
blues
music
with
european
music


some
black
composers
such
as
scott
were
writing
music
called
ragtime
which
had
a
very
different
rhythm
from
standard
european
music
but
used
notes
that
were
similar
to
some
european
music


ragtime
was
a
big
influence
on
early
jazz
called
<collocation>dixieland jazz</collocation>


jazz
musicians
used
instruments
such
as
the
trumpet
saxophone
and
clarinet
were
used
for
the
tunes
melodies
drums
for
percussion
and
plucked
double
bass
piano
banjo
and
guitar
for
the
background
rhythm
<collocation>rhythmic section</collocation>


jazz
is
usually
improvised
the
players
make
up
invent
the
music
as
they
play


even
though
jazz
musicians
are
making
up
the
music
jazz
music
still
has
rules
the
musicians
play
a
series
of
chords
groups
of
notes
in
order


jazz
music
has
a
swinging
rhythm


the
word
swing
is
hard
to
explain


for
a
rhythm
to
be
a
swinging
rhythm
it
has
to
feel
natural
and
relaxed


<collocation>swing rhythm</collocation>
is
not
even
like
a
march


there
is
a
feel
instead
of
a
feel


a
swinging
rhythm
also
gets
the
people
who
are
listening
excited
because
they
like
the
sound
of
it


some
people
say
that
a
swinging
rhythm
happens
when
all
the
jazz
musicians
start
to
feel
the
same
pulse
and
energy
from
the
song


if
a
jazz
band
plays
very
well
together
people
will
say
that
is
a
swinging
jazz
band
or
that
band
really
swings
well

an
example
of
writing
music
in
staff
musical
notation
is
the
way
music
is
written
down


music
needs
to
be
written
down
in
order
to
be
saved
and
remembered
for
future
performances


in
this
way
composers
people
who
write
music
can
tell
others
how
to
play
the
musical
piece
as
it
was
meant
to
be
played


also
called
is
the
way
tones
are
named


it
was
made
in
order
to
give
a
name
to
the
several
tones
and
pitches


for
example
the
eight
basic
notes
do

do
are
just
the
names
of
the
of
the
eight

that
confirm

written
music
music
can
be
written
in
several
ways


when
it
is
written
on
a
staff
like
in
the
example
shown
the
pitches
tones
and
their
duration
are
represented
by
symbols
called
notes


notes
are
to
put
on
the
lines
and
in
the
spaces
between
the
lines


each
position
says
which
tone
must
be
played


the
higher
the
note
is
in
the
staff
the
higher
the
pitch
of
the
tone


the
lower
the
notes
are
the
lower
the
pitch


the
duration
of
the
notes
how
long
they
are
played
for
is
shown
by
making
the
note
heads
black
or
white
and
by
giving
them
stems
and
flags


music
can
also
be
written
with
letters
naming
them
as
in
the
do

was
made
to
simplify
the
lecture
of
music
notes
although
it
is
mostly
used
to
represent
chords
and
the
names
of
the
music
scales


these
ways
to
represent
music
ease
the
way
a
person
reads
music


there
are
more
ways
to
write
and
represent
music
but
they
are
less
known
and
may
be
more
complicated


how
to
enjoy
music
by
listening
people
can
enjoy
music
by
listening
to
it


they
can
go
to
concerts
to
hear
musicians
perform


classical
music
is
usually
performed
in
concert
halls
but
sometimes
huge
festivals
are
organized
in
which
it
is
performed
outside
in
a
field
or
stadium
like
pop
festivals


people
can
listen
to
music
on
computers
television
the
radio
and
even
<collocation>mobile phones</collocation>


there
is
so
much
music
today
in
elevators
shopping
malls
and
stores
that
it
often
becomes
a
background
sound
that
we
do
not
really
hear


sometimes
it
is
good
to
listen
more
closely
to
music
by
trying
to
hear
the
different
instruments
and
what
types
of
notes
the
instruments
are
playing


by
playing
or
singing
people
can
learn
to
play
an
instrument


probably
the
most
for
complete
beginners
is
the
piano
or
keyboard
the
guitar
or
the
recorder
which
is
certainly
the
cheapest
to
buy


after
they
have
learned
to
play
scales
play
simple
tunes
and
read
the
simplest
musical
notation
then
they
can
think
about
which
instrument
for
further
development


they
should
choose
an
instrument
that
is
practical
for
their
size


for
example
a
very
short
child
can
not
play
a
full
size
double
bass
because
the
double
bass
is
over
five
feet
high


people
should
choose
an
instrument
that
they
enjoy
playing
because
playing
regularly
is
the
only
way
to
get
better


finally
it
helps
to
have
a
good
teacher


by
composing
anyone
can
make
up
his
or
her
own
pieces
of
music


it
is
not
difficult
to
compose
simple
songs
or
melodies
tunes


it
easier
for
people
who
can
play
an
instrument
themselves


all
it
takes
is
experimenting
with
the
sounds
that
an
instrument
makes


someone
can
make
up
a
piece
that
tells
a
story
or
just
find
a
<collocation>nice tune</collocation>
and
think
about
ways
it
can
be
changed
each
time
it
is
repeated


the
instrument
might
be
someone
own
voice
