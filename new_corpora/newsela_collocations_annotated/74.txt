even
though
that
is

do
not

how
easily

one
reason
for
confusion
about
tree
damage
from

involves
the
dormancy
of
trees
during

another
factor
is
that
trees
may
not
show
symptoms

damage
until
months
or
longer
after
damage
has
occurred


for
that
reason

who

the

qualities
but
has
one
poor
quality
called
a
tragic
flaw
that
causes
trouble
for
him
and
may
cause
him
or
his
family
or
friends
to
be
in
trouble


often
in
a
tragedy
there
is
one
thing
that
the
hero
does
not
want
to
happen
and
tries
to
prevent
but
no
matter
what
he
does
it
makes
this
thing
more
and
more
sure
to
happen


tragedies
originated
in
ancient
greek
theater
where
they
were
performed
at
religious
festivals


the
three
most
famous
greek
tragedy
writers
were
aeschylus
sophocles
and
euripides


other
famous
writers
include
shakespeare
and
jean


sometimes
the
word
tragedy
is
also
used
to
mean
something
with
a
bad
outcome
in
real
life

is
a
branch
of
science


it
is
about
the
laws
and
principles
of
classifying
things


from
one
type
of
many
classifications
might
be
produced


the
kind
of
is
used
for
the
classification
of
living
and
extinct


each
organism
has
a
scientific
name


this
name
is
part
of
the
<collocation>biological classification</collocation>
of
that
species


the
name
is
the
same
all
over
the
world
so
that
when
scientists
from
different
places
talk
or
write
about
the
living
thing
they
can
understand
each
other


in
addition
a
species
has
a
position
in
the
tree
of
life


thus
the
crow
is
corvus
a
member
of
the
family
and
they
are
birds


that
is
well
agreed
but
the
classification
of
other
groups
is
not
agreed
at
present
and
often
several
classifications
are
being
discussed


living
things
are
classified
into
three
domains
bacteria
and


the
highest
rank
in
a
domain
is
the
kingdom


each
kingdom
has
many
smaller
groups
in
it
called
phyla


each
phylum
has
more
smaller
groups
in
it
called
classes


this
pattern
looks
like
branches
on
a
tree
with
smaller
branches
growing
from
them


each
species
is
put
into
a
group
because
of
what
it
does
how
and
what
it
eats
special
body
parts
and
so
on


at
the
end
of
the
pattern
the
groups
genera
are
very
small


then
each
species
in
the
genus
is
given
its
own
name


when
someone
writes
about
a
living
thing
and
its
formal
scientific
name
they
write
the
genus
and
species
name


this
is
known
as
binomial
nomenclature
because
it
uses
two
names
for
each
organism


the
first
is
the
genus
name
and
the
second
is
the
species
in
that
genus


the
scientific
name
of
the
domestic
cat
is
felis


sometimes
it
is
enough
to
write


these
are
the
major
groups
ranks
used
in
kingdom
phylum
class
order
family
genus
species
some
mnemonics
sayings
to
help
a
person
remember
something
king
came
over
from
greater
spain
when
people
started
naming
species
latin
was
a
language
widely
used
in
europe


all
species
names
are
still
written
in
latin


this
has
some
advantages


since
latin
is
no
longer
spoken
it
is
unchanging
and
is
owned
by


it
gets
over
the
problem
of
every
language
having
its
own
names
for
animals
and
plants


scientists
used
to
write
the
official
description
of
each
new
species
in
latin


on
january
the
international
botanical
congress
changed
to
allow
english
as
well
as
latin
for
describing
new
plant
species


the
international
code
of
zoological
nomenclature
recommends
choosing
a
language
that
is
widely
used
and
that
is
used
in
the
places
where
the
species
lives

an

modern
approach

this
approach
is
based
on
the

course

evolution


like
traditional
<collocation>linnaean classification</collocation>
it
uses
characters
traits
to
decide
on
the
branches
of
the
classification


it
insists
on
groups
being


this
has
the
effect
that
birds
are
not
a
class
but
a
of
dinosaurs


it
also
means
the
ranking
system
described
above
would
be
abolished

there

many
changes
in
the
classification

this
turmoil
in
has
led
to
many
<collocation>alternative classifications</collocation>


it
is
caused
partly
from
the
move
from
linnaean
to
principles
and
partly
by
the
use
of
sequence
data
in


an
example
is
the
way
derived
groups

birds
should
not
be
classified
at
the

the

evolved

birds
