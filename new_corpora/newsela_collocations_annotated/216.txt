canberra
was
started
in
and
in
the
middle
of
the
city
is
lake


this
lake
was
created
especially
for
the
city


there
was
a
competition
to
design
the
new
capital
city
of
australia


the
competition
was
won
by
an
architect
from
chicago
in
the
united
states
of
america


his
name
was
walter
burley
griffin


griffin
designed
his
triangular
town
as
a
garden
town
so
its
size
expanded
over
a
big
area


but
as
canberra
grew
larger
and
larger
the
lake
was
no
longer
in
the
middle
of
the
town
but
the
people
who
are
in
charge
of
planning
the
city
make
sure
canberra
is
as
close
to
griffin
original
plan
as
possible


canberra
has
a
size
in
area
nearly
as
big
as
berlin
but
the
number
of
people
who
live
there
is
much
smaller


before
canberra
was
founded
australia
two
most
important
cities
sydney
and
melbourne
were
arguing
which
city
should
be
the
capital
of
the
continent


first
melbourne
was
elected
the
capital
but
in
there
was
a
vote


the
result
an
area
of
square
kilometers
was
given
to
the
country
by
new
south
wales
to
build
canberra
in


this
was
the
place
kilometers
away
from
sydney
and
with
a
distance
of
kilometers
to
melbourne
where
a
few
years
later
canberra
was
built


the
name
canberra
is
pronounced
in
various
ways
and
most
commonly
now
as
making
it
sound
almost
an
english
name


some
say
a
small
number
of
people
may
pronounce
it
at
an
earlier
time
was
very
common
and
that
form
is
still
heard
although
often
looked
down
upon
as
ignorant
and
incorrect


but
while
now
an
uncommon
pronunciation
it
may
be
closest
to
the
original
name
and
pronunciation


in
the
century
a
farming
property
on
the
limestone
plains
was
named
or
and
some
think
this
name
is
derived
in
turn
from
the
name
of
the
local
tribe
the
or
or
people


others
have
suggested
the
name
is
derived
from
an
aboriginal
word
meaning
meeting
place


tourists
who
visit

come

the
<collocation>greenhouse effect</collocation>
occurs
when
certain
gases
in
the
atmosphere
the
air
around
the
earth
entrap
infrared
radiation


this
effect
makes
the
planet
warmer
in
the
same
way
a
greenhouse
keeps
its
inside
temperature
warmer


the
<collocation>greenhouse effect</collocation>
is
caused
by
<collocation>greenhouse gases</collocation>
the
most
important
<collocation>greenhouse gases</collocation>
in
earth
atmosphere
are
water
vapor
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
and
methane


when
there
is
more
greenhouse
gas
in
the
air
the
air
holds
more
heat


this
is
why
more
<collocation>greenhouse gases</collocation>
cause
global
warming


the
<collocation>greenhouse effect</collocation>
is
natural


it
is
important
for
life
on
earth


without
the
<collocation>greenhouse effect</collocation>
the
earth
average
temperature
would
be
around
or
degrees
celsius
or
<collocation>degrees fahrenheit</collocation>


because
of
the
<collocation>greenhouse effect</collocation>
the
earth
actual
average
temperature
is
degrees
celsius
<collocation>degrees fahrenheit</collocation>


the
problem
is
that
recently
the
<collocation>greenhouse effect</collocation>
has
become
stronger


scientists
believe
this
is
because
humans
have
been
using
large
amounts
of
<collocation>fossil fuels</collocation>
which
release
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
when
they
are
burned


since
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
is
a
greenhouse
gas
it
has
caused
the
planet
to
warm
over
the
past
years


about
ten
thousand
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
before
people
started
burning
large
amounts
of
<collocation>fossil fuels</collocation>
there
was
to
parts
per
million
of
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
in
the
atmosphere


in
september
the
figure
was


most
scientists
say
that
having
or
less
is
safe
for
the
environment
and
that
species
on
the
planet
can
adapt
to
this
level


higher
levels
can
make
severe
problems
for
animal
and
marine
life
that
are
already
being
seen
today
such
as
ocean


the
<collocation>greenhouse effect</collocation>
was
first
proposed
by
joseph
fourier
in


mars
venus
and
other
planets
with
atmospheres
also
have
greenhouse
effects


the
effect
on
venus
is
especially
strong
because
venus
has
so
much


this
is
why
venus
is
hotter
than
mercury
even
though
mercury
is
closer
to
the
sun

first
person
to
predict
that
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
from

radiation
is
a
process
in
physics
where
something
sends
out
particles
or
waves
that
can
an
atom
or
molecule
through
atomic
interactions


the
strength
of
radiation
depends
on
the
energy
of
the
individual
particles
or
waves
and
not
a
function
of
the
number
of
particles
or

present

some
radiation
can
go
through

body
and
other
objects


usually
when
people
use
the
term
radiation
they
are
talking
specifically
about
potentially
harmful
types
of
radiation


if
something
produces
this
sort
of
radiation
we
can
say
it
is
radioactive


there
is
a
little
radiation
all
around
us
all
the
time
which
people
bodies
are
used
to
but
larger
amounts
of
radiation
can
make
people
sick

them


natural

by
<collocation>radioactive decay</collocation>
of
some
chemical
elements
such
as
uranium


stars
and
other
things
in

space
also
make

see
<collocation>cosmic ray</collocation>


some
isotopes
that
are
radioactive
only
stay
radioactive
for
much
less
than
a
second


other
things
can
stay
radioactive
for
thousands
of
years


people
and
anything
that
lives
gives
off
radiation
naturally
because
of
the
potassium

inside


some
of
the
machines
that
make
radiation
are
called
<collocation>particle accelerators</collocation>


scientists
use
these
machines
to
make
radiation
so
they
can

machines
also

this
radiation
is
spread
by
the
dust
ash
and
smoke
produced

the

<collocation>nuclear reactors</collocation>
are
used
to
make
electricity


they
make
a
lot
of
radiation
but
the
reactors
are
built
carefully
to
keep
the
radiation
inside
the
reactor


but
many
people
are
afraid
that
if
there
were
a
problem
with
the
reactor
radioactive
material
could
escape
into
the
environment
harming
or
killing
many
animals
and
people


also
the
parts
of
the
reactor
stay
radioactive
and
can
kill
people
for
hundreds

thousands
of

people
are
not

have
microbes
in
them
which
are
grown
in
cell
cultures


the
cell
cultures
are
then
analyzed
to
see
if
the
person
is
infected
with
tb


if
the
patient
has
tb
but
does
not
show
symptoms
the
disease
is
latent


doctors
use
a
skin
test
called
the
test
to
detect
latent
tb


they
often
do
blood
tests
too


there
is
a
vaccine
against
some
forms
of
tuberculosis


it
is
called
bacillus
vaccine


tb
used
to
be
easily
treated
and
cured
with
antibiotics


however
the
bacterium
is
now
highly
resistant
to
most
antibiotics


this
resistance
makes
treatment
difficult


many
different
kinds
of
antibiotics
need
to
be
given
over
a
long
period
of
time


there
is
a
form
of
tuberculosis
that
is
resistant
to
all
drugs


prevalence
this
world
map
shows
the
prevalence
of
tb
per
people
as
of


countries
with
more
cases
are
shown
yellow
those
with
fewer
cases
are
shown
in
blue


the
most
cases
were
recorded
in
africa
many
occurred
in
asia
as
well


experts
believe
that
one
third
of
the
world
population
is
infected
with
tuberculosis


new
infections
occur
at
a
rate
of
one
per
second


in
about
million
chronic
cases
were
active
globally


in
about
million
new
cases
developed
and
nearly
million
people
died
from
the
disease
most
of
them
in
developing
countries


the
number
of
tuberculosis
cases
has
been
decreasing
since
and
new
cases
have
decreased
since


tuberculosis
does
not
happen
at
the
same
rate
around
the
world


about
eighty
percent
of
the
population
in
many
asian
and
african
countries
test
positive
in
tuberculin
tests
but
only
five
to
ten
percent
of
the
united
states


people
usually
get
tuberculosis
because
of
a
weakened
immune
system


many
people
with
and
aids
can
also
get
tuberculosis
