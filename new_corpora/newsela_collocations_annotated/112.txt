eastern
england
in
the
century


a
related
tribe
called
the
saxons
settled
in
the
south
of
england


that
is
why
that
period
of
english
history
is
called


for
the
majority
of
this
time
england
did
not
exist
as
a
united
country


the
lived
in
many
small
kingdoms
which
slowly
united


the
later
countries
of
england
and
wales
were
formed
from
the
earlier
roman
britain


england
became
one
country
in


the
first
king
of
england
was
but
he
lost
a
lot
of
land
to
danish
invaders
who
formed
their
own
country
in
the
east
and
north


many
villages
and
towns
in
this
area
particularly
in
yorkshire
and
still
have
danish
names
and
use
some
words


at
one
time
in
the
west
of
england
was
the
only
english
kingdom
left


after
many
battles
king
alfred
the
great
of
became
king
of
the
whole
of
england
and
the
old
kingdoms
just
became
provinces
called
governed
by
an
earl


soon
after
alfred
died
the
king
of
denmark
knut
or
ruled
england


england
soon
had
an
english
king
again


when
king
edward
the
confessor
died
harold
the
earl
of
became
king


william
the
conqueror
duke
of
normandy
today
part
of
northern
france
said
that
harold
had
promised
to
make
william
the
king
so
he
invaded
england
and
fought
king
harold
at
the
battle
of

won

england
took
over
the
country
of
wales
in
the
century


there
were
many
wars
often
against
france
and
scotland


for
many
centuries
the
religion
of
england
was
roman
catholicism


the
bishops
church
leaders
of
england
and
all
their
churches
obeyed
the

and
the
church
in

italy


during
the
<collocation>protestant reformation</collocation>
many
of
the
bishops
did
not
agree
with
this


in
the
the
pope
told
king
henry
that
he
could
not
divorce
his
wife


king
henry
created
the
church
of
england
a
protestant
church
so
that
he
could
divorce
his
wife
and
made
it
the
official
church
in

for
the
next
years
there
was
fighting
over
whether
the

should
be

she
had
no
children

the

became

of

he
called

great

they
were
still

parliaments
and
laws
even
though
they
were

james

parliament
fought
each
other
in
the
english
civil
war
scotland
and

were

is
complicated

and
be

in


when
king
charles
ii
died
his
brother
james
ii
was
the
next
king


a
lot
of
people
did
not
like
james
because

was
roman
catholic


england
was
invaded
by
william
of
orange
ruler
of
part
of
the
netherlands
and
husband
of
mary
the
daughter
of
king
james


many
people
welcomed
william
because
he
was
a
protestant


james
left
the
country
without
a
fight
and
parliament
asked
william
and
mary
to
become
king
and
queen
together

of

died
william
ruled
alone


queen

in

now
included

was
called

the
