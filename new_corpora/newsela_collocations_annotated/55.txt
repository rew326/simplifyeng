the
latest
moon
was
discovered
from
examining
hubble
telescope
on
july


it
is
only
miles
across
allowing
it
to
evade
detection
even
by

a
telescope
or

binoculars
will
show
neptune
as
a
small
blue
dot
similar
in
appearance
to
uranus


the
blue
color
comes
from
the
methane
in
its
atmosphere


its
small
obvious
size
has
made
it
difficult
to
study
visually
most
<collocation>telescopic data</collocation>
was
quite
limited
until
the
arrival
of
the
<collocation>hubble space</collocation>
telescope
and
large
telescopes
with
<collocation>adaptive optics</collocation>


with
an
orbital
period
period
of
julian
years
neptune
will
soon
return
for
discovery
to
the
same
place
in
the
sky
where
it
was
discovered
in


this
will
happen
three
different
times
also
with
a
fourth
in
which
it
will
come
very
close
to
being
at
that
position


these
are
april
when
it
will
be
in
motion
july
when
it
will
be
in
<collocation>retrograde motion</collocation>
and
february
when
it
will
be
in
motion


it
will
also
come
very
close
to
being
at
the
same
point
since
the
discovery
in
late
october
through
november
when
neptune
will
turn
from
retrograde
to
direct
motion
on
the
exact
degree
of
neptune
discovery
and
will
then
stop
for
a
moment
along
the
within
arc
minutes
at
that
point
closest
on
november


this
will
be
the
last
time
for
about
the
next
years
that
neptune
will
be
at
its
point
of
discovery


this
is
explained
by
the
idea
of


like
all
planets
and
asteroids
in
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
beyond
earth
neptune
goes
through
at
certain
points
during
its
period


in
addition
to
the
start
of
other
events
inside
the
period
include
astronomical
opposition
the
return
to
motion
and
conjunction
to
the
sun


in
its
orbit
around
the
sun
neptune
returned
to
its
original
point
of
discovery
in
august


exploration
exploration
of
neptune
voyager


currently
only
one
spacecraft
has
visited
neptune


nasa
voyager
probe
made
a
quick
flyby
of
the
planet
with
its
<collocation>closest encounter</collocation>
on
august
and
was
the
last
planet
to
have
been
visited
by
at
least
one
spacecraft


some
of
voyager
important
discoveries
was
its
very
close
of
triton
where
took
pictures
of
several
parts
of
the
moon


the
probe
also
discovered
the
great
dark
spot
although
it
has
now
disappeared
after
when
the
<collocation>hubble space</collocation>
telescope
took
pictures
of
neptune
in


originally
thought
to
be
a
large
cloud
or
storm
system
it
was
later
guessed
just
to
be
a
hole
in
the
visible
<collocation>cloud deck</collocation>


neptune
turned
out
to
have
the
<collocation>strongest winds</collocation>
of
all
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
<collocation>gas giants</collocation>


in
the
outer
regions
of
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
where
the
sun
shines
over
times
fainter
than
on
earth
still
very
bright
with
a
magnitude
of
the
last
of
the
four
giants
did
happen
as
what
the
scientists
actually
expected


one
might
think
that
the
farther
a
planet
is
from
the
sun
the
less
energy
and
heat
there
would
be
to
create
and
run
the
very
strong
winds
around


the
winds
on
jupiter
were
already
hundreds
of
kilometres
per
hour


rather
than
seeing
slower
winds
the
scientists
found
faster
winds
over
on
more
distant
neptune


one
possible
guess
for
the
cause
of
the
faster
wind
speeds
is
that
if
enough
energy
is
produced
turbulence
is
created
which
slows
the
winds
down
like
those
of
jupiter


at
neptune
however
there
is
so
little
solar
energy
that
once
winds
are
started
they
meet
very
little
resistance
and
are
able
to
keep
very
high
speeds


anyhow
neptune
gives
out
more
energy
than
it
gets
from
the
sun
and
the
internal
energy
source
of
these
winds
<collocation>remains undetermined</collocation>


the
pictures
sent
back
to
earth
from
voyager
in
became
the
basis
of
a
program
called
neptune
all
night

history
the

part
of
the
city
the
island
of
manhattan
still
has
its
original
native
american
name


although
native
people
such
as
the
and
had
lived
there
for
many
thousands
of
years
<collocation>new york</collocation>
city
was
first
explored
by
europeans
in
the


florentine
explorer
da
found
the
entrance
to
<collocation>new york</collocation>
harbor
in
the
year
and
english

was
settled
by
europeans
from
the
netherlands
in


the
dutch
called
the
whole

amsterdam
new

after
the
capital

which
was
to

<collocation>new york</collocation>


the
english
took
over
the
colony
in
during
the
second
war


they
changed
the
name
to
<collocation>new york</collocation>
to
honor
the
duke
of
york
who
later
became
king
james
ii
of
england


the
dutch
surrendered
amsterdam
without
fighting


they
were
afraid
of
the
english
royal
navy
so
they
traded
the
town
to
england
for
the
colony
of
surinam
in
south
america
which
they
thought
was
worth
more
money


by

took

there
were
many

towns

been

made
it
stayed

came
together
with
the
bronx

this
