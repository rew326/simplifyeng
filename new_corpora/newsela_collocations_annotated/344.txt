light
pollution
is
a
type
of
pollution


it
is
defined
as
any
adverse
or
bad
effect
as
a
result
of
lights


usually
this
means
too
much
light


several
species
including
plants
and
humans
are
badly
affected
by
light
pollution


most
people
have
never
heard
of
light
pollution
and
those
who
have
usually
do
care
or
do
anything
about
it


light
pollution
costs
americans
billions
of

every
year

solution
types
of
light
pollution
there
are
five
kinds
of
light
pollution
sky
glow
<collocation>light trespass</collocation>
clutter
glare
sky
glow
usually
has
more
of
an
effect
on
the
environment
than
<collocation>light trespass</collocation>
and
glare
but
all
of
them
are
a
major
problem
to
people
today


sky
glow
is
the
kind
of
light
pollution
that
prevents
people
from
seeing
stars
and
other
objects


this
causes
birds
to
not
be
able
to
migrate
to
the
right
place
because
they
can
not
follow
the
moon
and
stars


sky
glow
also
prevents
astronomers
from
seeing
dim
objects


<collocation>light trespass</collocation>
is
when
light
being
used
by
a
person
goes
into
the
property
of
another


though
<collocation>light trespass</collocation>
is
not
an
environmental
issue
it
is
still
light
pollution


the
third
kind
of
light
pollution
glare
has
different
kinds


the
first
disability
glare
is
the
loss
of
visibility
because
of
too
many
lights


discomfort
glare
is
when
the
lights
cause
pain


<collocation>effects effects</collocation>
on
animals
light
pollution
stops
migrating
birds
of
having
any
way
of
seeing
the
moon
and
stars
they
need
to
use
to
the
of
their
migration
therefore
not
being
able
to
migrate
to
the
correct
place


also
sea
turtles
do
not
come
to
shore
and
nest
as
often
because
they
are
afraid
of
the
lights


it
also
affects
animals
eyes
as
a
flash
of
camera
weakens
the
eyesight
of
animals


effects
on
<collocation>humans glare</collocation>
causes
sleep
problems
in
humans


too
much
light
in
an
apartment
shining
in
from
a
nearby
billboard
will
disturb
their
sleep


also
science
is
being
affected
by
light
pollution


astronomers
have
no
way
of
observing
or
making
discoveries
with
too
much
light
to
block
the
night
sky


it
also
causes
headache
as
when
light
directly
falls
into
our
eyes
and
affects
the
sensory
nerves


the
solution
group
solution
there
are
now
several
groups
that
are
trying
to
prevent
light
pollution


light
pollution
first
made
news
in
when
an
observatory
was
specially
placed
just
to
avoid
light
pollution


however
it
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
most
people
until
june
when
the
czech
republic
passed
the
world
first
light
pollution
law


since
then
light
pollution
is
slowly
being
recognized
by
the
general
public
as
a
major
problem


<collocation>individual solution</collocation>
you
can
lower
the
amount
of
light
pollution
by
having
lights
off
when
they
are
not
needed


you
can
also
shield
yourself
from
this
pollution
by
putting
curtains
on
a
window
facing
the
street
or
any
other
disturbing
light

all

have
a

millimeters


an

used
on
a
polycarbonate
plastic
leads
to
the
creation
of
microscopic

today
production
uses
this
type

to
create
different

because
it
can
resist

low

aluminum

the

a
submarine
or
sub
is
a
vessel
that
goes
under
water


most
large
submarines
are
war
vessels


some
small
ones
are
used
for
scientific
or
business
purposes


these
are
often
called
submersibles
and
can
not
go
far
or
stay
long
away
from
base


some
rich
people
buy
their
own
to
explore
under
the
sea
and
look
at
fish


a
submarine
is
always
called
a
boat
not
a
ship


history
in
early
times
submarines
were
often
powered
by
hand


this
is
because
boat
engines
had
not
been
invented
yet


they
were
almost
always
designed
to
be
used
for
war


submarines
would
try
to
sink
enemy
ships
by
crude
methods


these
included
drilling
screws
into
their
wooden
hulls


some
tried
to
blow
up
a
ship


this
often
destroyed
the
submarine
too


later
during
the
first
and
second
world
wars
better
submarines
were
made


many
of
these
better
submarines
were
created
by
germany


the
submarines
were
powered
by
a
diesel
electric
system


a
diesel
motor
would
be
used
to
turn
a
generator


the
generator
would
charge
a
large
number
of
batteries
while
the
submarine
was
above
the
water


this
power
was
then
used
to
power
the
submarine
when
it
went
underwater


these
submarines
were
dangerous
for
enemies


they
were
hard
to
see
while
underwater
but
it
was
easy
to
attack
them
when
they
were
above
the
water
and
recharging


the
first
battle
of
the
atlantic
was
the
first
major
battle
that
was
mainly
fought
between
submarines
and
their
enemies


as
in
later
wars
the
main
jobs
of
submarines
were
to
enforce
blockade
and
to
sink
enemy
warships


they
usually
attacked
freighters
at
night
shooting
with
their
guns
and
then
hiding
under
the
water


sometimes
they
used
their
torpedoes
especially
against
large
ships
and
warships


after
<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii
better
sonar
helped
the
enemies
of
submarines
to
find
and
kill
them


new
subs
were
more
streamlined
and
had
no
artillery
because
water
dragging
against
the
guns
made
noise
underwater
and
slowed
the
subs


modern
submarines
most
large
modern
military
submarines
are
powered
by
<collocation>nuclear reactors</collocation>


these
submarines
often
have
a
system
which
can
get
air
from
the
seawater


these
two
things
allow
them
to
stay
under
water
for
long
periods
of
time


their
most
important
use
are
attacking
ships
or
launching
missiles


these
include
<collocation>cruise missiles</collocation>
and
nuclear
missiles


there
are
two
kinds
of
these
subs


<collocation>attack subs</collocation>
are
small
and
fast


they
attack
other
subs
and
surface
ships
with
a
special
kind
of
underwater
bomb
called
a
torpedo


missiles
subs
are
larger
and
slower


they
are
built
to
shoot
missiles
at
targets
on
land


<collocation>missile subs</collocation>
are
usually
big
enough
to
carry
commandos
and
launch
them
safely
from
their
torpedo
tubes
