for

other
television
shows
or
movies
and
are
not

much
longer
than

have
audio
advertisements
that

an
advertisement
for

is
called
a
trailer


it
shows
a

be
released
in

takes
place
on
websites


these
may
appear
as
banner
ads
or


they
are
often
still
images
or
<collocation>flash animations</collocation>


the
owner
of
the

<collocation>user clicks</collocation>
on
the
advertisement


sometimes
they
will
get
a
percentage
of
the
money
if
they
buy

billboards
advertise
products
on
city
streets


these
may
simply
be
freestanding
billboards
or
may
be
part
of
street
furniture
such
as
a

are
often
covered

use
many
different
techniques

sex
is
also
often

notice
their
advert
they
need
to
sell
the
product
or
brand


they
may
try
to
make
the
product
look
appealing
however
often
advertisers
use
humor
to
get
people
to
remember
the
brand
without

or
spoil
a

<collocation>united kingdom</collocation>
it

except
in
the
shop
where
it
is
sold
and
this
is
also
restricted


in
france
it
is
illegal
to

alcohol
meaning
that
when
many
european
football

they
can
not
play

island
a
lord
buddha
is
a
very
holy
person
in
buddhism


the
word
buddha
means
enlightened
one
in
sanskrit


buddha
was
born


he
was
the
man
who
started
buddhism


sometimes
people
call
him
the
buddha


other
times
people
call
any
person
a
buddha
if
they
have
found
enlightenment


if
a
person
has
not
found
enlightenment
yet
but
is
very
close
to
reaching
it
then
he
is
called
bodhisattva


in
early
buddhism
buddha
meant
only


later
an
idea
began
that
there
could
be
many
some
in
the
past
some
maybe
in
the
present
and
some
in
the
future


since
buddhism
tradition
thinks
buddha
is
an
ideal
person
tradition
reached
a
notion
of
ideal
features
of


some
of
those
features
are
represented
on
statues
of


some
other
features
like
the
feature
of
their
foot
are
difficult
to
be
represented
on
a
statue


buddhists
believe
that
the
buddha
was
enlightened
which
means
that
he
knew
all
about
how
to
live
a
peaceful
life
and
how
to
not
to
suffer
in
an
afterlife


they
think
he
never
got
depressed
frustrated
upset
or
confused


he
is
said
to
have
never
argued
with
other
people
but
just
said
what
was
true
and
useful
out
of
compassion


taught
if
one
studies
the
<collocation>buddhist scriptures</collocation>
one
will
see
the
buddha
compassion


he
taught
the
dhamma
to
those
who
wanted
to
listen
he
taught
for
the
sake
of
their
benefit
and
wellbeing


he
wanted
to
help
the
listeners
and
did
not
want
any
misfortune
to
occur
to
them
no
matter
who
they
were


even
shortly
before
his
final
passing
away
he
still
taught
the
dhamma
to
who
became
the
last
disciple
in
the
presence
of
the
buddha
himself


this
clearly
shows
his
great
compassion


some
buddhists
pray
to
but
are
not
gods


are
just
teachers
to
help
people
who
will
listen


a
buddha
is
a
human
being
who
has
woken
up
and
can
see
the
true
way
the
world
works


this
knowledge
totally
changes
the
person
beyond
birth
death
and
rebirth


nothing
can
annoy
him
anymore
even
the
circulation
of
incarnation
since
his
enlightenment
put
him
outsides
of
this
<collocation>eternity circle</collocation>
in
time
and
space


this
person
can
help
others
become
enlightened
too
in
a
proper
way


there
are
ideas
which
are
said
to
lead
someone
to
enlightenment


they
are
called
the
dharma
meaning
the
way
or
the
truth


anyone
can
become
a
buddha
it
is
said
but
it
is
very
hard


age
and
gender
do
not
matter


buddhists
believe
there
have
been
many
who
were
alone
called


they
reached
enlightenment
on
their
own
but
they
did
not
teach
others


the
first
buddha
was
afraid
to
teach
people
too


their
poor
understanding
made
them
hard
to
teach


but
he
did
teach
people
and
people
followed
him

pages

references
what
was
the
buddha
life
really
like

benefits
of

caption
a
painting
often
used
to
help
explain
what
a
person
with
schizophrenia
experiences


it
may
cause
delusions
paranoia
hallucinations
disordered
thinking
and
behavior
and
catatonia


in
many
cases
the
first
symptoms
appear
between
the
ages
of
and


the
word
schizophrenia
comes
from
two
greek
words
that
mean
to
split
and
mind
because
there
is
a
split
between
what
going
on
in
their
minds
and
what
happening
in
reality


a
person
with
schizophrenia
does
not
change
between
different
personalities
they
have
only
one


the
condition
in
which
a
person
has
multiple
personalities
is
dissociative
identity
disorder


schizophrenia
has
many
different
symptoms
and
not
everyone
with
schizophrenia
has
all
of
them


for
this
reason
some
scientists
think
that
schizophrenia
is
several
separate
diseases
that
have
some
of
the
same
symptoms


schizophrenic
delusions
are
<collocation>actual perceptions</collocation>
that
occur
in
or
near
the
auditory
system
of
the
brain


the
brain
can
not
tell
them
apart
from
normal
sounds
that
are
heard


this
is
not
yet
fully
understood
by
science


we
can
not
say
whether
a
schizophrenic
person
is
hearing
wavelengths
other
than
normal
or
their
own
imagination


there
are
many
<collocation>risk factors</collocation>
that
might
cause
a
person
to
develop
schizophrenia


they
include
genetics
the
disorder
runs
in
families


also
<collocation>environmental factors</collocation>
like
as
viruses
<collocation>oxygen deprivation</collocation>
and
poor
nutrition
may

affect
a

foetus


people
with
schizophrenia
may
also
have
other
<collocation>mental health</collocation>
disorders
like
depression
anxiety
and
drug
abuse


they
often
have
problems
functioning
in
society
and
have
difficulty
maintaining
<collocation>stable employment</collocation>


however
there
are
a
small
number
of
people
with

who
are
able

college

different
types
of
psychotherapy
such

therapies
such

cognitive
symptoms
or
cognitive
deficits
cognitive
symptoms
are
problems
with
attention
certain
types
of
memory
concept
of
time
and
the
ability
to
plan
and
organize


cognitive
deficits
caused
by
schizophrenia
can
also
be
difficult
to
recognize
as
part
of
the
disorder


they
are
the
most
disabling
of
the
symptoms
because
cognitive
problems
affect
everyday
functioning


symptoms
around
percent
of
men
and
percent
of
women
who
have
schizophrenia
had
signs
of
schizophrenia
before
they
were
years
old


this
phase
can
occur
as
long
as
months
before
symptoms
begin


during
the
phase
people
who
go
on
to
develop
schizophrenia
might
have
brief
or
serious
or
violent
symptoms
as
well
as
the
symptoms
of
social
withdrawal
annoyance
a
general
feeling
of
extreme
unhappiness
and
clumsiness


violent
behavior
a
minority
of
people
with
schizophrenia
have
an
increased
risk
for
<collocation>aggressive behavior</collocation>


the
risk
for
<collocation>aggressive behavior</collocation>
increases
with
alcohol
abuse
substance
abuse
<collocation>antisocial personality</collocation>
or
neurological

individuals
with
severe
<collocation>mental illness</collocation>
such
as

have

<collocation>causes schizophrenia</collocation>
<collocation>risk factors</collocation>


a
combination
of
a
person
genes
and
environment
plays
a
role
in
the
development
of
schizophrenia


people
who
have
a
family
history
of
schizophrenia
and
who
experienced
a
brief
period
of
<collocation>psychotic symptoms</collocation>
have
a
to
chance
of
being
diagnosed
one
year
later


inherited
<collocation>factors estimates</collocation>
of
whether
schizophrenia
is
inherited
vary
because
separating
the
effects
of
a
person
genes
and
environment
is
difficult


the
greatest
risk
percent
for
developing
schizophrenia
is
having
a
relative
with
the
condition


when
a
person
with
schizophrenia
has
an
<collocation>identical twin</collocation>
that
twin
also
has
the
condition
in
more
than
percent
of
the
cases


many
genes
are
probably
involved
each
to
a
small
degree


in
the
largest
study
of
its
kind
it
was
found
that
schizophrenia
autism
major
depression
and
<collocation>bipolar disorder</collocation>
and
are
genetically
linked


they
have
the
same
differences
in
four
regions
of
the


<collocation>environmental factors</collocation>
<collocation>environmental factors</collocation>
that
are
<collocation>risk factors</collocation>
for
schizophrenia
are
drug
use
stress
before
birth
and
in
some
cases
exposure
to
infectious
disease


living
in
an
urban
environment
during
childhood
or
as
an
adult
has
consistently
been
found
to
increase
the
risk
of
schizophrenia
by
a
factor
of
two


this
is
true
even
after
taking
into
account
drug
use
ethnicity
and
the
size
of
one
social
group


other
factors
that
play
an
important
role
include
whether
the
person
feels
socially
isolated
as
well
as
<collocation>social adversity</collocation>
<collocation>racial discrimination</collocation>
failures
in
family
functioning
unemployment
and
poor
housing
conditions


there
is
evidence
that
childhood
experiences
of
abuse
or
trauma
are
<collocation>risk factors</collocation>
for
developing
schizophrenia
later
in
life


an
electrical
impulse
called
an
action
potential
travels
down
the
axon
of
a
neuron


at
the
end
of
the
neuron
the
action
potential
causes
the
release
of
different
chemicals
called
neurotransmitters
into
the
space
called
the
synapse
between
that
axon
and
the
axon
or
of
the
next

the
<collocation>neurotransmitters cross</collocation>
the
synapse
and
set
up
the
action
potential
in
the
next
neuron


there
are
different
types
of
neurotransmitters
dopamine
glutamate
and
serotonin
are
three
which
are
linked
to
the
symptoms
of
schizophrenia


it
could
be
there
is
too
much
of
a
neurotransmitter
in
one
area
of
the
brain
or
not
enough
in
others


it

the
neurons
in
the
brain
are
connected
and
form
pathways
which
in
turn
form
neural

which
is
like
the

wiring


to
complete
a
task
like
recalling
a
memory
usually
more
than
one
region
of
the

is
involved
