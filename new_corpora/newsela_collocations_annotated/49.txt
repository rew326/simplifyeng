mars
has
two

the
planet
mars
is
made
of
rock


the
ground
there
is
red
because
of
iron
oxide
rust
in
the
rocks
and
dust


the
planet
atmosphere
is
very
thin
and
contains
a
lot
of
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
and
a
very
tiny
amount
of
oxygen


the
temperatures
on
mars
are
colder
than
on
earth
because
it
is
farther
away
from
the
sun
and
has
less
air
to
keep
warmth
in


there
is
water
ice
and
frozen
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
at
the
north
and
south
poles


mars
does
not
have
any
liquid
water
on
the
surface
now
but
signs
of
on
the
surface
were
probably
caused
by
water

rotation
a
martian
day
is
called
a
sol
and
is
a
little
longer
than
an
earth
day


mars
rotates
in
hours
and
minutes


it
rotates
on
a
tilt
just
like
the
earth
does
so
it
has
four
different
seasons


of
all
the
planets
in
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
the
seasons
of
mars
are
the
most
due
to
the
similar
tilts
of
the
two
planets
rotational
axes


the
lengths
of
the
martian
seasons
are
about
twice
those
of
earth
as
mars
greater
distance
from
the
sun
leads
to
the
martian
year
being
about
two
earth
years
long

<collocation>polar caps</collocation>
to
highs
of
up
to
convert
c
f
in
equatorial
summer


the
wide
range
in
temperatures
is
due
mostly
to
the
thin
atmosphere
which
can
not
store
much
solar
heat


the
planet
is
also
times
as
far
from
the
sun
as
earth
resulting
in
just

liquid
water
can
not
exist
on
the

of
mars
due
to
its
low
atmospheric
pressure
there
not
enough

the

huge

chilling

when

that
sweep

atmosphere
mars
has
a
very
thin
atmosphere
with
barely
any
oxygen
it
is
mostly
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>


because
there
is
an
atmosphere
however
thin
it
is
the
sky
does
change

when
the
sun
rises
and
sets


the
dust
in
the
<collocation>martian atmosphere</collocation>
make
the
martian
sunsets
have
a
rather
blue
color


mars
atmosphere
of
course
is
too
thin
to
protect
mars
from
meteors
which
is
why
the
lower
half
of
mars
has
so
many
craters


some
craters
hit
mars
with
so
much
force
a
few
pieces
of
mars
went
flying
into
space
even
to
earth


people
have
actually
found
rocks
on
earth
that
have
chemicals
in
them
chemicals
that
are
exactly
like
the
ones
in
martian
rocks


these
rocks
also
look
like
they
fell
really
quickly
through
the
atmosphere
so
it
is
reasonable
to
think
they
came
from
mars


geography
mars
is
home
to
the
highest
known
mountain
in
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
olympus


olympus
is
about
miles
or
kilometers
high


this
is
more
than
three
times
the

of

<collocation>mount everest</collocation>


it
is

observation
of
mars
a

made
in
by
the
french
astronomer
our
records
of
watching
and
recording
mars
start
with
ancient
egyptian
astronomers
in
the
millennium


<collocation>detailed observations</collocation>
of
the
location
of
mars
were
made
by
<collocation>babylonian astronomers</collocation>
who
developed
methods
using
math
to
predict
the
future
position
of
the
planet


the
ancient
greek
philosophers
and
astronomers
developed
a
model
of
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
with
the
earth
at
the
center
instead
of
the
sun


they
used
this
model
to
explain
the
planet
motions


indian
and
islamic
astronomers
estimated
the
size
of
mars
and
its
distance
from
earth


similar
work
was
done
by
chinese
astronomers


in
the
century
nicholas
copernicus
proposed
a
model
for
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
in
which
the
planets
follow
circular
orbits
about
the
sun


this
model
was
the
beginning
of
modern
astronomy


it
was
revised
by
johannes
who
gave
an
<collocation>elliptical orbit</collocation>
for
mars
which
better
fit
the
data
from
our
observations


the
first
observations
of
mars
by
telescope
was
by
galileo
galilei
in


within
a
century
astronomers
discovered
distinct
features
changes
in
brightness
on
the
planet
including
the
dark
patch
and
polar
ice
caps


they
were
able
to
find
the
planet
day
rotation
period
and
axial
tilt


better
telescopes
developed
early
in
the
century
allowed
permanent
martian
features
to
be
mapped
in
detail


the
first
crude
map
of
mars
was
published
in
followed
by
better
maps
from
onward


astronomers
mistakenly
thought
they
had
detected
the
spectroscopic
mark
of
water
in
the
<collocation>martian atmosphere</collocation>
and
the
idea
of
life
on
mars
became
popular
among
the
public


believed
he
could
see
an
artificial
network
of
canals
on
mars


these
linear
features
later
proved
to
be
an
optical
illusion
and
the
atmosphere
was
found
to
be
too
thin
to
support
an
environment
including
surface
water


yellow
clouds
on
mars
have
been
observed
since
the
which
were

or

during
the
the
range
of
martian
surface
temperature
was

it
ranged

that
the
thin
<collocation>martian atmosphere</collocation>
contained
extensive
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
roughly
double
the
quantity
found
in

the
first
standard
naming
of
mars
surface
features
was
set
in
by
the
international
astronomical
union


since
the
<collocation>multiple robotic</collocation>
spacecraft
and
rovers
have
been
sent
to
explore
mars
from
orbit
and
the
surface


the
planet
has
remained
under
observation

and
instruments

broad
range

during
the
opposition
italian
astronomer
used
a
convert
cm
on
telescope
to
help
produce
the
first
detailed
map
of
mars


what
caught
people
attention
was
that
the
maps
had
features
he
called
canali


these
were
later
shown
to
be
an
optical
illusion
not
real


these
canali
were
supposedly
long
straight
lines
on
the
surface
of
mars
to
which
he
gave
names
of
famous
rivers
on
earth


his
term
canali
was
popularly
mistranslated
in
english
as
canals
and
thought
to
be
made
by
<collocation>intelligent beings</collocation>


other
astronomers
thought
they
could
see
the
canals
too
especially
the
american
astronomer
who
built
his
telescopes
and
his
career
on
the
idea


although
these
results
were
widely
accepted
they
were
contested


greek
astronomer
and
english
naturalist
<collocation>alfred russel</collocation>
were
against
the
idea
was
extremely
outspoken


as
bigger
and
better
telescopes
were
used
fewer
long
straight
canali
were
observed


during
an
observation
in

life
on
mars


because
mars
is
the
one
of
the
closest
planets
to
earth
in
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
many
have
wondered
if
there
is
any
kind
of
life
on
mars


today
we
know
that
the
kind
of
life
if
any
would
be
some
simple
bacteria
type
organism


<collocation>meteorites nasa</collocation>
maintains
a
catalog
of
mars
meteorites
that
is
meteorites
which
originally
came
from
mars


these
assets
are
highly
valuable
since
they
are
the
only
physical
samples
available
of
mars


studies
at
nasa
johnson
space
center
show
that
at
least
three
of
the
meteorites
contain
possible
evidence
of
past
life
on
mars
in
the
form
of
microscopic
structures
resembling
fossilized
bacteria


although
the
scientific
evidence
collected
is
reliable
and
the
rocks
are
correctly
described
what
made
the
rocks
look
like
they
do
is
not
clear


to
date
scientists
are
still
trying
to
agree
if
it
really
is
evidence
of
simple
life
on
mars


over
the
past
few
decades
scientists
have
agreed
that
when
using
meteorites
from
other
planets
found
on
earth
or
rocks
brought
back
to
earth
various
things
are
needed
to
be
sure
of
life


those
things
include
did
the
rock
comes
from
the
right
time
and
place
on
the
planet
for
life
to
exist


does
the
sample
contain
evidence
of
bacterial
cells
does
it
show
fossils
of
some
kind
even
if
very
tiny


is
there
any
evidence
of


minerals
usually
caused
by
living
things
is
there
any
evidence
of
isotopes
typical
of
life


are
the
features
part
of
the
meteorite
and
not
contamination
from
earth


for
people
to
agree
on
past
life
in
a
geologic
sample
most
or
all
of
these
things
must
be
met


this
has
not
happened
yet
but
investigations
are
still
in
progress


of
the
found
in
the
three
<collocation>martian meteorites</collocation>
are
underway


the
significance
of
water
liquid
water
is
necessary
for
life
and
metabolism
so
if
water
was
present
on
mars
the
chances
of
life
evolving
is
improved


the
viking
orbiters
found
evidence
of
possible
river
valleys
in
many
areas
erosion
and
in
the
<collocation>southern hemisphere</collocation>
branched
streams


since
then
rovers
and
orbiters
have
also
looked
closely
and
eventually
proved
water
was
on
the
surface
at
one
time
and
is
still
found
as
ice
in
the
polar
ice
caps
and
underground


today
so
far
scientists
have
not
found
life
on
mars
either
living
or
extinct


several
space
probes
have
gone
to
mars
to
study
it


some
have
orbited
gone
around
the
planet
and
some
have
landed
on
it


there
are
pictures
of
the
surface
of
mars
that
were
sent
back
to
earth
by
the
probes


some
people
are
interested
in
sending
astronauts
to
visit
mars


they
could
do
a
better
search
but
getting
astronauts
there
would
be
difficult
and
expensive


the
astronauts
would
be
in
space
for
many
years
and
it
could
be
very
dangerous
because
of
radiation
from
the
sun


so
far
we
have
only
sent
<collocation>unmanned probes</collocation>


the
most
recent
probe
to
the
planet
is
the
mars
science
laboratory


it
landed
on
in
<collocation>gale crater</collocation>
on
mars
on
august


it
brought
with
it
a
mobile
explorer
called
curiosity


it
is
the
most
advanced
space
probe
ever


curiosity
has
dug
up
martian
soil
and
studied
it
in
its
laboratory


it
has
found
sulfur
chlorine
and
water
molecules


popular
culture
main
mars
in
fiction
some
famous
stories
were
written
about
this
idea


the
writers
used
the
name
martians
for
<collocation>intelligent beings</collocation>
from
mars


in
wells
wrote
the
war
of

a
famous
novel
about
martians
attacking
the
earth


in
broadcast
a
radio
version
of
this
story
in
the

and
many
people
thought
it
was
really
happening
and
were
very
afraid

a
magnifying
glass
used
to
look
at
a
postage
stamp
a
magnifying
glass
is
a
lens
through
which
can
be
used
to
make
things
appear
bigger
so
you
can
see
them
better


the
magnifying
glass
consists
of
a
piece
of
convex
shaped
glass
or
plastic


it
has
to
be
held
at
the
right
distance
between
the
eye
and
the
object
for
the
object
to
be
in
focus


the
magnifying
glass
usually
comes
with
a
handle


a
telescope
is
a
more
advanced
kind
of
magnifying
glass
and
consists
of
at
least
two
glass
lenses


a
pair
of
binoculars
is
like
a
telescope
for
each
eye


spectacles
or
eyeglasses
also
use
lenses
to
correct
a
person
vision


this
is
a
sugar
molecule


carbon
atoms
are
made
blue
oxygen
atoms
are
made
red
and
hydrogen
atoms
are
made
white
to
show
the
difference


in
reality
atoms
do
not
have
a
color


a
molecule
is
the
smallest
amount
of
a
chemical
substance
that
can
exist


if
a
molecule
were
split
into
smaller
pieces
it
would
be
a
different
substance


molecules
are
made
up
of
atoms
that
are
stuck
together
in
a
particular
shape
or
form


not
all
combinations
of
atoms
are
usually
possible
atoms
like
certain
shapes
but
not
others


also
they
like
certain
arrangements
of
atoms


for
example
oxygen
atoms
always
have
two
bonds
with
other
atoms
carbon
atoms
always
have
four
bonds
with
other
atoms
and
nitrogen
atoms
always
have
three
bonds
with
other
atoms


in
gases
like
air
the
molecules
are
just
flying
around


in
liquids
like
water
the
molecules
are
stuck
together
but
they
can
still
move


in
solids
like
sugar
the
molecules
can
only
vibrate


there
is
also
another
state
of
matter
known
as
plasma
where
the
molecules
fly
around
crazier
and
faster
than
those
in
a
gas


with
a
molecular
formula
you
can
write
down
the
numbers
of
all
atoms
in
a
molecule


for
example
the
molecular
formula
of
glucose
is
c
h
o


that
means
that
one
molecule
of
glucose
is
made
up
of
six
carbon
atoms
twelve
hydrogen
atoms
and
six
oxygen
atoms


bonding
for
a
molecule
to
exist
atoms
have
to
stick
together


this
happens
when
two
atoms
share
electrons


instead
of
circling
just
one
atom
the
electron
now
circles
around
two


this
is
called
bonding


the
shared
electrons
are
called
bonds


sometimes
more
than
one
electron
is
shared


the
more
electrons
are
shared
the
stronger
the
bond
gets
and
the
stronger
the
atoms
stick
together


bonds
can
also
be
broken
apart


since
most
bonds
require
energy
to
form
they
also
give
off
energy
when
they
are
broken


but
before
most
bonds
break
the
molecule
has
to
be
heated


then
the
atoms
start
to
move
and
when
they
move
too
much
the
bond
breaks


molecules
that
require
less
energy
to
break
than
they
give
off
when
broken
are
called
fuels


for
example
a
candle
will
just
sit
there
and
nothing
happens


but
when
you
use
a
match
to
light
it
it
will
burn
for
a
long
time
