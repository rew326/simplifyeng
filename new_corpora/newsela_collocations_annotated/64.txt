it

a
river
is
a
stream
of
water
that
flows
through
a
channel
or
passage
in
the
surface
of
the
ground


the
passage
where
the
river
flows
is
called
the
riverbed
and
the
earth
on
each
side
is
called
a
riverbank


a
river
begins
on
high
ground
or
in
hills
or
mountains
and
flows
down
from
the
high
ground
to
the
lower
ground
because
of
gravity


a
river
begins
as
a
small
stream
and
gets
bigger
the
farther
that
it
flows


the
water
in
a
river
is
called
fresh
water


it
comes
from
rain
or
snow
and
it
can
usually
be
drunk
safely
unless
it
has
been
polluted


the
water
in
a
sea
can
not
be
drunk
safely
because
it
is
known
as
salt
water


both
people
and
animals
often
live
near
rivers
because
they
need

to
survive

river
is
often
in
a

bed
and
flows
quickly
downhill
over

and
around
big
rocks


young
rivers
often
have
lots
of
small
waterfalls
and

the
source
of

may
be

often
on

a

is
water
that

may
be
a
lake
where
lots
of

streams
gathers
when
it
rains
or
snows


a
river
may
begin
in
mountains
where
there
is
snow


the
melting
snow
runs
together
to
form
a
small
stream
that
runs
down
the
mountain


as
more
little
streams
run
in
the
main
stream
gets
bigger
until
it
forms
a
river


some
rivers
flow
from
hills
where
there
is
no
snow
but
lots
of
rain


some
rivers
only
flow
after
there
has

run
fast


it
sweeps

it

wider
than
a

but
not
as

as

people
use

is
called

the
countryside

as
it
flows

becomes
wider
and
slower


a
wide

is
called
an

floods

after

the
shape
of

depends
on
the
conditions
of

where

if
there
is

like

when
