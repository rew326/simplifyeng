life
luther
studied
philosophy
at
the
university
of


in
he
entered
into
the
order
as
a
monk


luther
studied
theology
and
ancient
languages
in


in
he
became
a
doctor
of
theology
in
and
began
his
lectures
on
the
psalms
and
letters
of
paul


in
october
luther
wrote
his
theses


many
people
think
that
he
put
them
on
the
door
of
a
church
in
but
this
is
not
sure


instead
he
published
a
copy


he
presented
these
to
church
officials
at
worms
cathedral


luther
called
them
the
of
doctor
martin
luther
on
the
power
and
efficacy
of
indulgences


it
questioned
the
teaching
of
the
western
church
and
its
ideas
about
penance
the
authority
of
the
pope
and
the
usefulness
of
indulgences


at
that
time
the
catholic
church
was
saying
that
they
were
allowed
to
decide
who
could
go
to
heaven
after
death
and
they
were
selling
indulgences
for
money
to
tell
them
they
could
go
to
heaven


if
that
was
true
it
would
mean
that
poor
people
would
not
be
able
to
go
to
heaven
but
that
the
priests
in
the
church
would
be
rich
from
selling
these
things


luther
thought
that
this
was
all
wrong
and
was
against
the
bible


after
studying
the
letters
of
paul
especially
the
letter
to
romans
luther
came
up
with
an
idea
called
sola
fide


this
means
that
faith
is
the
only
way
that
people
can
get
salvation
from
god


according
to
sola
fide
this
would
mean
that
many
church
customs
were
useless
and
should
be
cast
away


first
luther
believed
that
he
could
reform
change
the
roman
church
from
the
inside
while
still
being
a
part
of
the
church
with
his
theses
but
the
papacy
took
his
attitude
as
heresy
and
excommunicated
him
on
june
with
a
paper
saying
he
did
not
have
their
permission
to
go
to
heaven


in
october
luther
burned
the
paper
in
public
and
showed
he
would
not
obey
the
church
unless
they
accepted
his
words


emperor
charles
v
opened
the
imperial
diet
of
worms
on
january
to
hear
the
case


for
luther
it
was
the
last
chance
to
say
he
had
been
wrong


but
he
did
not
change
his
mind


the
diet
declared
luther
an
outlaw


with
the
help
of
a
friend
luther
hid
in
castle
near


in
the
castle
he
translated
the
bible


first
he
wrote
the
new
testament
in
german
instead
of
the
original
greek


later
he
translated
the
<collocation>old testament</collocation>
into
german
too


until
then
the
holy
mass
and
the
bible
were
in
latin


very
few
people
understood
it


most
people
went
to
mass
and
did
not
understand
what
the
priest
said
because
they
did
not
speak
latin


luther
translated
the
bible
so
that
more
people
could
read
and
understand
it


that
way
they
were
no
longer
depending
on
the
priest
to
tell
them
what
was
in
the
bible
but
could
read
it
themselves


luther
started
his
own
church
called
the
lutheran
church
with
his
friend
philip


luther
died
in


family
from
the
bible
luther
formed
firm
ideas
about
families


luther
knew
that
what
a
child
learned
at
home
would
greatly
influence
his
life


he
said
in
<collocation>table talks</collocation>
sermons
very
little
<collocation>edify children</collocation>
who
learn
little
thereby
it
is
more
needful
they
be
taught
and
well
instructed
in
schools
and
at
home
and
that
they
be
learned
and
examined
what
they
have
learned
this
way
profits
much
tis
very
but
very
necessary


luther
also
preached
against
the
catholic
church
demands
that
ministers
remain
single
not
married


after
hearing
his
preaching
many
nuns
wrote
to
him
to
ask
for
help
in
escaping
their
convents


luther
helped
nine
nuns
escape
one
convent


on
april
luther
had
a
friend
help
the
nuns
sneak
over
the
wall
and
then
hid
them
in
barrels
on
a
wagon
until
they
were
out
of
the
city


one
of
these
nuns
was
katherine
von
bora


after
<collocation>finding husbands</collocation>
for
the
nuns
whose
families
would
not
accept
them
luther
had
to
find
a
husband
for
katherine
von
bora


katherine
however
not
only
rejected
a
match
luther
arranged
for
her
but
said
she
would
accept
only
luther
or
another
pastor
named
as
her
husband


at
first
luther
did
not
really
like
katherine
and
supposed
she
was
proud
and
haughty


his
feelings
changed
though
and
they
married
on
june


luther
later
said
and
thank
god
it
hath
turned
out
well
for
i
have
a
pious
holy
and
faithful
wife
to
whom
one
may
safely
commit
give
his
heart


they
had
six
children


on
june
luther
wrote
i
am
a
happy
husband
for
from
the
most
precious
woman
my
best
of
wives
i
have
received
by
the

the
firstborn
was
john
luther


the
next
was
a
daughter
elizabeth
but
elizabeth
died
when
she
was
just
eight
months
old
and
luther
wrote
in
a
letter
my
little
daughter
elizabeth
is
taken
from
me
and
hath
left
me
with
a
bleeding
and
almost
womanly

what
liberals
believe
some
liberals
believe
that
freedom
is
impossible
without
equality
and
that
governments
should
promote
equality
by
providing
education
and
health
care
supported
by
taxes


other
liberals
believe
that
taxes
are
bad
and
that
people
should
provide
their
own
education
and
health
care
these
people
are
usually
called
libertarians
today


most
liberal
governments
today
do
provide
at
least
some
education
and
health
care
though
not
necessarily
equally
for
all
citizens


other
concepts
important
to
some
liberals
include
free
markets
market
economy
people
should
be
free
to
buy
and
sell
goods
and
services


peace
people
should
not
start
wars
or
use
violence


the
philosophy
of
liberalism
in
the
old
days
kings
or
queens
told
people
what
to
do
a
form
of
government
called
a
monarchy
and
there
was
very
little
freedom


a
few
<collocation>hundred years</collocation>
ago
philosophers
such
as
john
<collocation>stuart mill</collocation>
and
jeremy
began
to
write
about
freedom


<collocation>earlier writers</collocation>
such
as
had
written
about
freedom
but
this
time
the
idea
caught
on


the
united
states
of
america
was
the
first
country
to
have
a
constitution
which
was
based
on
the
ideas
of
mill
and
and
which
guaranteed
certain
rights
to
all
citizens
including
freedom
of
speech
freedom
of
the
press
freedom
of
religion
the
right
to
assemble
get
together
in
groups
the
right
to
bear
arms
weapons
and
the
right
to
ask
their
government
to
take
action
right
of
petition
or
to
remove
from
office
rulers
they
did
not
like
right
of
referendum


another
idea
that
became
popular
around
this
time
was
the
idea
of
free
trade


a
leading
philosopher
who
promoted
free
trade
was
adam
smith


liberalism
today
most
of
the
wealthy
countries
in
the
world
today
are
<collocation>liberal democracies</collocation>
with
more
or
less
free
trade


an
exception
to
this
rule
are
the
countries
not
all
of
which
are
liberal
or
democratic


most
of
the
poor
countries
in
the
world
are
dictatorships
with
heavy
restrictions
on
trade


china
is
a
poor
country
which
is
rapidly
becoming
rich
and
is
trying
the
experiment
of
combining
dictatorship
with
free
trade


whether
it
is
possible
to
have
the
advantages
of
free
trade
without
other
freedoms
remains
to
be
seen


liberalism
around
the
world
while
all
liberal
governments
support
free
elections
other
ideas
of
liberal
government
vary
a
great
deal
from
country
to
country


for
information
about
liberalism
in
a
particular
country
look
for
an
article
called
liberalism
in
and
then
the
name
of
the
country


united
states
the
government
of
the
united
states
was
created
based
on
a
belief
in
democracy
and
personal
freedom


however
the
word
liberalism
has
taken
on
a
different
meaning
in
modern
times
