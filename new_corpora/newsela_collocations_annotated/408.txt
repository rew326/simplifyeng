general
relativity
general
relativity
is
a
theory
of
space
and
time


the
theory
was
created
by
albert
einstein
in
november
and
published
in
early


the
central
idea
of
general
relativity
is
that
space
and
time
are
two
aspects
of
spacetime


spacetime
is
curved
when
there
is
gravity
matter
energy
and
momentum


the
links
between
these
forces
are
shown
in
the
einstein
field
equations


one
equation
in
general
relativity
is
e
mc
and
there
are
many
more


in
general
relativity
an
observer
in
and
an
observer
standing
still
on
a
body
with
mass
such
as
the
earth
see
no
difference
in
the
movement
of
an
object
they
drop


this
is
known
as
the
principle


the
sun
can
be
seen
as
this
kind
of
valley
in
spacetime
and
one
of
the
other
objects
in
the
valley
is
the
earth


the
earth
does
not
roll
directly
towards
the
sun
or
ball
because
it
is
moving
too
fast


the
force
pulling
the
earth
towards
the
sun
is
about
the
same
as
a
second
force


this
second
force
is
called
the
centrifugal
force


the
centrifugal
force
exists
because
the
earth
moves
sideways


this
sideways
motion
makes
the
distance
between
the
earth
and
sun
increase


since
the
earth
is
being
pulled
towards
the
sun
and
moving
away
at
the
same
time
it
stays
at
about
the
same
distance


this
is
also
how
the
<collocation>moon orbits</collocation>
the
earth


in
this
second
case
earth
is
the
ball
and
the
moon
is
the
object


general
relativity
has
predicted
many
things
which
were
later
seen


these
include
as
light
gets
closer
to
the
sun
it
bends
towards
the
sun
twice
as
much
as
classical
physics
the
system
used
before
general
relativity
predicts


this
was
seen
in
an
experiment
arthur
did
in


when
scientists
saw
his
experiment
they
started
to
take
general
relativity
seriously


the
of
the
planet
mercury
rotates
along
its
orbit
more
than
is
expected
under
<collocation>newtonian physics</collocation>


general
relativity
accounts
for
the
difference
between
what
is
seen
and
what
is
expected
without
it


from
gravity


when
light
moves
away
from
an
object
with
gravity
moving
away
from
the
center
of
the
valley
it
is
stretched
into
longer
wavelengths


this
was
confirmed
by
the
experiment


the
delay


light
appears
to
slow
down
when
it
passes
close
to
a
massive
object


this
was
first
seen
in
the
by
space
probes
headed
towards
the
planet
venus
