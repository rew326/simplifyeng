a
virus
is
a
<collocation>tiny parasite</collocation>
which
can
infect
living
organisms


it
is
made
only
of
a
<collocation>nucleic acid</collocation>
a
<collocation>protein coat</collocation>


usually
the
<collocation>nucleic acid</collocation>
is
sometimes
it
is


their
method
is
to
get
their
<collocation>nucleic acid</collocation>
strand
into
a
or
cell


the
usually
strand
then
takes
over
the
cell
machinery
to
reproduce
itself
and
the
<collocation>protein coat</collocation>


the
cell
then
bursts
open
spreading
the
virus


all
viruses
act
in
this
way
and
there
are
no
viruses


viruses
are
ubiquitous
everywhere
and
all
organisms
suffer
their
attacks


viruses
are
much
smaller
than
bacteria


they
were
not
visible
until
the
invention
of
the
<collocation>electron microscope</collocation>


a
virus
has
a
simple
structure


it
has
no
internal
cellular
structure
no
cell
wall
or
cell
membrane
just
the
<collocation>protein coat</collocation>
that
holds
the
string
of
<collocation>nucleic acid</collocation>


with
cells
the
virus
<collocation>protein coat</collocation>
is
able
to
enter
the
target
cells
via
certain
cell
<collocation>membrane receptors</collocation>


with
bacteria
cells
the
bacteriophage
physically
injects
the
<collocation>nucleic acid</collocation>
strand
into
the
host
cell


viruses
have
the
following
characteristics
infectious
particles
causing
many
types
of
disease
contain
<collocation>nucleic acid</collocation>
core
or
surrounded
by
a
protective
<collocation>protein coat</collocation>
when
the
host
cell
has
finished
making
more
viruses
it
undergoes
lysis
or
breaks
apart


the
viruses
are
released
and
are
then
able
to
infect
other
cells


viruses
can
remain
intact
for
a
long
time
and
will
infect
cells
when
the
time
and
conditions
are
right


some
specialised
viruses
are
worth
noting


have
evolved
to
enter
bacterial
cells
which
have
a
different
type
of
cell
wall
from
cell

viruses
when
they
reproduce
cover
themselves
with

layer
that

some
of
our
most
viruses
like

and
use
this
method


viral
infections
in

provoke
an

there
are
millions
of
different
types
of
viruses
but
only
about
of
them
have
been
described
in
detail


a
virus
has
either
or
genes
and
is
called
an
virus
or
a
virus
respectively


the
vast
majority
of
viruses
have
genomes

viruses

<collocation>replication cycle</collocation>
<collocation>viral populations</collocation>
do
not
grow
through
cell
division
because
they
are


instead
they
use
the
machinery
and
metabolism
of
a
host
cell
to
produce
multiple
copies
of
themselves
and
they
assemble
in
the
cell


the
life
cycle
of
viruses
differs
greatly
between
species
but
there
are
six
basic
stages
in
the
life
cycle
of
viruses
attachment
is
a
specific
binding
between
viral
proteins
and
specific
receptors
on
the
host
cellular
surface


penetration
follows
attachment
single
virus
particles
enter
the
host
cell
through
or
membrane
fusion


this
is
often
called
viral
entry


the
infection
of
plant
and
fungal
cells
is
different
from
that
of
animal
cells


plants
have
a
rigid
cell
wall
made
of
cellulose
and
fungi
one
of
chitin


this
means
most
viruses
can
only
get
inside
these
cells
by
force


an
example
would
be
a
virus
travels
on
an
insect
vector
which
feeds
on
plant
sap


the
damage
done
to
cell
walls
would
let
the
virus
get
in


bacteria
like
plants
have
strong
cell
walls
that
a
virus
must
breach
to
infect
the
cell


however
given
that
bacterial
cell
walls
are
much
less
thick
than
plant
cell
walls
due
to
their
much
smaller
size
some
viruses
have
evolved
mechanisms
that
inject
their
genome
into
the
bacterial
cell
across
the
cell
wall
while
the
viral
remains
outside


is
a
process
in
which
the
viral
is
removed
this
may
be
by
degradation
by
viral
enzymes
or
host
enzymes
or
by
<collocation>simple dissociation</collocation>
the
is
the
releasing
of
the
<collocation>viral nucleic</collocation>
acid


replication
of
viruses
involves
multiplication
of
the
genome


this
usually
requires
synthesis
of
<collocation>viral messenger</collocation>
from
early
genes


this
may
be
followed
for
complex
viruses
with
larger
genomes
by
one
or
more
further
rounds
of
synthesis
late
<collocation>gene expression</collocation>
is
of
structural
or
proteins


following
the
self
assembly
of
the
virus
particles
some
modification
of
the
proteins
often
occurs


in
viruses
such
as
this
modification
sometimes
called
maturation
occurs
after
the
virus
has
been
released
from
the
host
cell


viruses
can
be
released
from
the
host
cell
by
lysis
a
process
that
kills
the
cell
by
bursting
its
membrane
and
cell
wall


this
is
a
feature
of
many
bacterial
and
some
animal
viruses


in
some
viruses
the
viral
genome
is
put
by
genetic
recombination
into
a
specific
place
in
the
host
chromosome


the
viral
genome
is
then
known
as
a
or
in
the
case
of
a


whenever
the
host
divides
the
viral
genome
is
also
replicated


the
viral
genome
is
mostly
silent
within
the
host
however
at
some
point
the
or
may
give
rise
to
active
virus
which
may
lyse
the
host
cells


chapter
enveloped
viruses
typically
are
released
from
the
host
cell
after
the
virus
acquires
its
envelope


the
envelope
is
a
modified
piece
of
the

plasma
membrane


genetic
material
and
replication
the
genetic
material
within
virus
particles
and
the
method
by
which
the
material
is
replicated
varies
considerably
between
different
types
of
viruses

the
<collocation>influenza virus</collocation>
is
a

<collocation>viruses replication</collocation>
usually
takes
place
in
the
cytoplasm


viruses
can
be
placed
into
four
different
groups
depending
on
their
modes
of
replication


all
viruses
use
their
own
enzymes
to
create
copies
of
their
genomes


viruses
the
<collocation>genome replication</collocation>
of
most
viruses
takes
place
in
the
cell
nucleus


most
viruses
are
entirely
dependent
on
the
host
cell
and
machinery
and
<collocation>processing machinery</collocation>


viruses
with
larger
genomes
may
encode
much
of
this
machinery
themselves


in
the
viral
genome
must
cross
the
cell
nuclear
membrane
to
access
this
machinery
while
in
bacteria
it

only
enter

they
are

an
example
of
the

is

<collocation>innate immune</collocation>
system
the
body
first
line
of
defense
against
viruses
is
the
<collocation>innate immune</collocation>
system


this
has
cells
and
other
mechanisms
which
defend
the
host
from
any
infection


the
cells
of
the
innate
system
recognize
and
respond
to
pathogens
in
a
general
way


interference
is
an
important
innate
defense
against
viruses


many
viruses
have
a
<collocation>replication strategy</collocation>
that
involves


when
such
a
virus
infects
a
cell
it
releases
its
molecule


a
protein
complex
called
dicer
sticks
to
it
and
chops
the
into
pieces


then
a
biochemical
pathway
called
the
complex
starts
up


this
attacks
the
viral
and
the
cell
survives
the
infection

the

is
coated
with
antibodies
which
stop

production
of

an
important
host
defense
mechanism


this
is
a
hormone
produced
by
the
body
when
viruses
are
present


its
role
in
immunity
is
complex
it
eventually
stops
the
viruses
from
reproducing
by
killing
the
infected
cell
and
its
close
neighbors


<collocation>adaptive immune</collocation>
system
vertebrates
have
a
second
more
specific
immune
system


it
is
called
the
<collocation>adaptive immune</collocation>
system


when
it
meets
a
virus
it
produces
specific
antibodies
that
bind
to
the
virus
and
render
it


two
types
of
antibodies
are
important


the
first
called
is
highly
effective
at
neutralizing
viruses
but
is
produced
by
the
cells
of
the
immune
system
only
for
a
few
weeks


the
second
called
is
produced
indefinitely


the
presence
of
in
the
blood
of
the
host
is
used
to
test
for
acute
infection
whereas
indicates
an
infection
sometime
in
the
past


antibody
is
measured
when
tests
for
immunity
are
carried
out


another
vertebrate
defense
against
viruses
is
immunity


it
involves
immune
cells
known
as
t
cells


the
body
cells
constantly
display
short
fragments
of
their
proteins
on
the
cell
surface
and
if
a
t
cell
recognizes
a
suspicious
viral
fragment
there
the
host
cell
is
destroyed
by
killer

evolution
viruses
do
not
belong
to
any
of
the
six
kingdoms


they
do
not
meet
all
the
requirements
for
being
classified
as
a
living
organism
because
they
are
not
active
until
the
point
of
infection


however
that
is
just
a
verbal
point


obviously
their
structure
and
mode
of
operation
means
they
have
evolved
from
other
living
things
and
the
loss
of
normal
structure
occurs
in
many
parasites


the
origins
of
viruses
in
the
evolutionary
history
of
life
are
unclear
some
may
have
evolved
from
plasmids
pieces
of
that
can
move
between
cells
while
others
may
have
evolved
from
bacteria

eastern
european
scientists
have
used
phage
therapy
as
an
alternative
to
antibiotics
for
some
time
and
interest
in
this
approach
is
increasing
because
of
the
high
level
of
<collocation>antibiotic resistance</collocation>
now
found
in
some
pathogenic
bacteria

the
microprocessor
a
kind
of
cpu
from
the
a
microprocessor
is
an
electronic
component
that
is
used
by
a
computer
to
do
its
work


it
is
a
central
processing
unit
on
a
single
<collocation>integrated circuit</collocation>
chip
containing
millions
of
very
small
components
including
transistors
resistors
and
diodes
that
work
together


microprocessors
help
to
do
everything
from
writing
to
searching
the
web


everything
a
computer
does
is
described
by
lots
of
<collocation>precise instructions</collocation>
and
microprocessors
carry
out
these
instructions
at
incredible
speed
many
millions
of
times
a
second


the
majority
of
microprocessors
are
used
in
embedded
systems
for
<collocation>mobile phones</collocation>
cars
military
weapons
and
home
appliances


some
microprocessors
are
so
small
and
inexpensive
that
they
are
used
to
control
very
simple
products
like
flashlights
and
greeting
cards
that
play
music
when
you
open
them


a
few
especially
powerful
microprocessors
are
used
in
personal
computers


microprocessor
operation
like
other
central
processing
units
microprocessors
use
three
steps
commonly
called
fetch
decode
and
execute


in
the
fetch
step
an
instruction
is
copied
from
the
computer
memory
into
the
microprocessor


in
the
decode
step
the
<collocation>microprocessor figures</collocation>
out
what
operation
the
instruction
is
meant
to
do


in
the
execute
step
this
operation
is
performed


operations
can
be
very
simple
like
adding
two
numbers
or
complicated
like
copying
a
series
of
letters
and
numbers
called
a
string
from
one
place
in
the
computer
memory
to
a
different
place


facts
and
<collocation>figures transistors</collocation>
in
a
microprocessor
can
be
less
than
one
<collocation>micrometer wide</collocation>
one
millionth
of
a
meter


by
comparison
a
single
hair
can
be
over
<collocation>microns wide</collocation>


the
transistors
are
mostly
microprocessors
are
made
from
silicon
quartz
metals
and
other
chemicals


from
start
to
finish
it
takes
about
months
to
make
a
microprocessor


microprocessors
are
classified
by
the
size
of
their
data
bus
or
address
bus


they
are
also
grouped
into
and
types


heat
from
the
sun


heat
is
a
form
of
energy


in
thermodynamics
heat
means
energy
which
is
moved
between
two
things
when
one
of
them
is
hotter
than
the
other
