though
he
was
due
a
triumph
in
rome
he
also
wanted
to
stand
for
consul
the
most
senior
magistracy
in
the
republic


faced
with
the
choice
between
a
triumph
and
the
caesar
chose
the


after
election
he
was
a
consul
in


the
first
<collocation>triumvirate caesar</collocation>
took
power
with
pompey
the
great
and


these
three
men
ruled
rome
and
were
called
the
triumvirate


caesar
was
the
for
and
pompey


they
had
been
at
odds
for
years
but
caesar
tried
to
reconcile
them


between
the
three
of
them
they
had
enough
money
and
political
influence
to
control
public
business


this
informal
alliance
known
as
the
first
triumvirate
rule
of
three
men
was
cemented
by
the
marriage
of
pompey
to
caesar
daughter


caesar
also
married
again
this
time
to
who
was
the
daughter
of
another
powerful
senator


caesar
proposed
a
law
for
the
redistribution
of
public
lands
to
the
poor
a
proposal
supported
by
pompey
by
force
of
arms
if
need
be
and
by
making
the
triumvirate
public


pompey
filled
the
city
with
soldiers
and
the
triumvirate
opponents
were
intimidated


caesar
gallic
war
with
the
agreement
of
his
partners
caesar
became
the
governor
of
gaul


gaul
is
the
area
which
is
today
northern
italy
switzerland
and
france


caesar
was
the
commander
of
the
roman
legions
during
the
gallic
war


the
war
was
fought
on
the
side
of
rome
gallic
clients
against
the
germans
who
wanted
to
invade
gaul


it
was
also
to
extend
rome
control
of
gaul


caesar
conquest
of
gaul
extended
rome
territory
to
the
north
sea


in
he
conducted
the
first
roman
invasion
of
britain


caesar
wrote
about
this
war
in
his
book
<collocation>de bello</collocation>
about
the
gallic
wars


this
book
written
in
latin
is
an
important
historical
account


these
achievements
got
him
great
military
power
and
threatened
to
eclipse
pompey


the
balance
of
power
was
further
upset
by
the
death
of
in


caesar
civil
war
in
the
senate
led
by
pompey
ordered
caesar
to
disband
his
army
and
return
to
rome
because
his
term
as
governor
had
finished


caesar
thought
he
would
be
prosecuted
if
he
entered
rome
without
the
immunity
enjoyed
by
a
magistrate


pompey
accused
caesar
of
insubordination
and
treason


crossing
the
rubicon
caesar
and
his
army
approached
rome
and
crossed
the
rubicon
a
shallow
river
in
italy
in


it
was
the
point
beyond
which
no
army
was
supposed
to
go


the
river
marked
the
boundary
between
cisalpine
gaul
to
the
north
and
italy
proper
to
the
south


crossing
the
rubicon
caused
a
civil
war


pompey
the
lawful
consul
and
his
friends
fled
from
rome
as
caesar
army
approached


pompey
managed
to
escape
before
caesar
could
capture
him


caesar
decided
to
head
for
spain
while
leaving
italy
under
the
control
of
<collocation>mark antony</collocation>


caesar
made
an
astonishing
to
spain
where
he
defeated
pompey
lieutenants


he
then
returned
east
to
challenge
pompey
in
greece


there
in
july
at
caesar
barely
avoided
a
catastrophic
defeat


he
then
decisively
defeated
pompey
at
the
battle
of
later
that
year


dictator
at
last
in
rome
caesar
was
appointed
dictator
with
<collocation>mark antony</collocation>
as
his
master
of
the
horse
second
in
command


caesar
presided
over
his
own
election
to
a
second
and
then
after
eleven
days
resigned
this
dictatorship


late
in
he
was
appointed
dictator
again
with
a
term
of
one
year


caesar
then
pursued
pompey
to
egypt
where
pompey
was
soon
murdered


caesar
then
became
involved
in
an
egyptian
civil
war
between
the
child
pharaoh
and
his
sister
wife
and
queen
cleopatra


perhaps
as
a
result
of
the
pharaoh
role
in
pompey
murder
caesar
sided
with
cleopatra


he
is
reported
to
have
wept
at
the
sight
of
pompey
head
which
was
offered
to
him
by
the
pharaoh
as
a
gift


in
any
event
caesar
defeated
the
pharaoh
forces
in
and
installed
cleopatra
as
ruler


caesar
and
cleopatra
celebrated
their
victory
with
a
triumphant
procession
on
the
nile
in
the
spring
of


the
<collocation>royal barge</collocation>
was
accompanied
by
additional
ships
introducing
caesar
to
the
luxurious
lifestyle
of
the
<collocation>egyptian pharaohs</collocation>


caesar
and
cleopatra
never
married
roman
law
only
recognized
marriages
between
two
roman
citizens


caesar
continued
his
relationship
with
cleopatra
throughout
his
last
marriage
which
lasted
years
in
roman
eyes
this
did
not
constitute
adultery
and
may
have
fathered
a
son
called


cleopatra
visited
rome
on
more
than
one
occasion
staying
in
caesar
villa
outside
rome
across
the
river
tiber


in
caesar
defeated
and
the
remnants
of
pompey
supporters
in
africa


he
was
then
appointed
dictator
for
ten
years


in
two
years
he
made
numerous
changes
in
roman
administration
to
improve
the
republic


many
of
these
changes
were
meant
to
improve
the
lives
of
ordinary
people


one
example
which
has
lasted
was
his
reform
of
the
calendar
into
the
present
format
with
a
leap
day
every
four
years


in
february
of
one
month
before
his
assassination
he
was
appointed
dictator
for
life


assassination

also
assassination
of
<collocation>julius caesar</collocation>
on
the
ides
of
march
march
of
caesar
was
due
to
appear
at
a
session
of
the
senate


<collocation>mark antony</collocation>
fearing
the
worst
went
to
head
caesar
off


the
plotters
expected
this
and
arranged
for
someone
to
intercept
him


according
to
around
sixty
or
more
men
participated
in
the
assassination


he
was
stabbed
times


according
to
a
physician
later
established
that
only
one
wound
the
second
one
to
his
chest
had
been
lethal


the
dictator
last
words
are
not
known
with
certainty
and
are
a
contested
subject
among
scholars
and
historians
alike


the
version
best
known
in
the
world
is
the
latin
<collocation>phrase et</collocation>
tu
brute


you
too
brutus


in
shakespeare
<collocation>julius caesar</collocation>
this
is
the
first
half
of
the
line
et
tu
brute


then
fall
caesar


according
to
plutarch
after
the
assassination
brutus
stepped
forward
as
if
to
say
something
to
his
<collocation>fellow senators</collocation>
they
however
fled
the
building


brutus
and
his
companions
then
marched
to
the
capitol
while
crying
out
to
their
beloved
city
people
of
rome
we
are
once
again
free


they
were
met
with
silence
as
the
citizens
of
rome
had
locked
themselves
inside
their
houses
as
soon
as
the
rumor
of
what
had
taken
place
had
begun
to
spread


he
has
been
mentioned
in
many
many
movies


a
wax
statue
of
caesar
was
erected
in
the
forum
displaying
the
stab
wounds


a
crowd
who
had
gathered
there
started
a
fire
which
badly
damaged
the
forum
and
neighbouring
buildings


in
the
ensuing
chaos
<collocation>mark antony</collocation>
later
caesar
and
others
fought
a
series
of
five
civil
wars
which
would
end
in
the
formation
of
the
roman
empire


the
roman
empire
and
its
emperors
were
so
important
in
history
that
the
word
caesar
was
used
as
a
title
in
some
european
countries
to
mean
emperor
even
long
after
the
roman
empire
was
gone


for
example
germany
king
was
called
a
kaiser
up
to
the
year
ce
and
russia
king
was
called
a
tsar
until
the
year
ce

on
a
<collocation>yearly basis</collocation>
during

just
after
the
actual
campaigns
as
a
sort
of
dispatches
from
the
front


apparently
simple
and
direct
in
style
to
the
point
that
caesar
are
commonly
studied
by
first
and
second
year
latin
students
they
are
in
fact
highly
sophisticated
tracts
aimed
particularly
at
the
readership
of
<collocation>minor aristocrats</collocation>
in
rome
italy
and
the
provinces


clear
epilepsy
based
on
remarks
by
plutarch
caesar
is
sometimes
thought
to
have
suffered
from
epilepsy


modern
scholarship
is
divided
on
the
subject


it
is
more
certain
that
he
was
plagued
by
malaria
particularly
during
the
of
the


caesar
had
four
documented
episodes
of
what
may
have
been
complex
partial
seizures


he
may
additionally
have
had
absence
seizures
petit
mal
in
his
youth


the
earliest
accounts
of
these
seizures
were
made
by
the
biographer
who
was
born
after
caesar
died


the
claim
of
epilepsy
is
countered
among
some
medical
historians
by
a
claim
of
hypoglycemia


this
can
cause
seizures
which
are
a
bit
like
epilepsy


in
psychiatrist
harbour
published
what
he
termed
as
the
caesar
complex
theory
arguing
that
caesar
was
a
sufferer
of
temporal
lobe
epilepsy
and
that
the
symptoms
were
a
factor
in
caesar
decision
to
forgo
personal
safety
in
the
days
leading
up
to
his
assassination

caption
hinduism
dharma
is
a
very
old
religion
from
india
that
is
still
practiced
today


it
was
one
of
the
first
religions
that
had
the
idea
of
reincarnation
that
people
can
be
born
again
after
death
karma
one
event
invents
another
or
that
every
action
has
its
consequences
and
other
ideas


hinduism
is
the
federation
of
a
number
of
faiths
a
group
of
or
sects
joined
together
which
have
evolved
from
people
who
lived
in
the
indian
subcontinent
land
near
the
<collocation>indian ocean</collocation>


one
group
accepts
the
varna
system
another
does
not
accept
it


one
group
accepts
another
does
not
accept
it


one
group
accepts
god
another
does
not
believe
in
god


but
they
are
all
called
hindus


the
indian
constitution
says
that
by
law
a
hindu
is
whoever
who
lives
in
india
and
is
not
a
muslim
or
a
christian


in
some
forms
of
hinduism
praying
is
very
important


hinduism
says
that
hindus
should
not
treat
people
badly
if
they
do
believe
in
hinduism


hindus
believe
that
there
could
be
more
than
one
correct
understanding
of
the
one
true
god


not
all
people
agree
on
whether
hinduism
is
a
believing
in
many
gods
or
believing
in
one
god
religion


many
people
think
that
hindus
believe
in
many
gods


others
say
that
there
is
only
one
god
in
hinduism


under
this
view
this
one
god
referred
to
as
brahman
is
expressed
in
many
ways


brahman
is
god
without
form
or
god
without
personal
attributes
things
that
make
them


while
gods
such
as
vishnu
or
shiva
are
forms
of
god
with
attributes


many
<collocation>hindu sects</collocation>
are
atheistic
do
not
believe
in

hinduism
takes
ideas
from
the
the
as
well
as
the
teachings
of
many
hindu
gurus
through
the
ages


many
different
types
of
thought
come
from
six
main
schools


sects
and
tantric
schools
are
very
common
paths
within
hinduism


the
eternal
way
the
eternal
way
in
sanskrit
dharma
or
the
perennial
is
the
one
name
that
has
represented
hinduism
for
thousands
of
years


according
to
hindus
it
speaks
the
idea
that
certain
spiritual
principles
are
true
for
all
time
surpassing
beliefs
and
representing
a
pure
science
of
consciousness


this
consciousness
is
not
just
that
of
the
body
or
mind
and
intellect
but
of
a
above
the
mind
that
exists
within
and
beyond
our
existence
the
pure
self
of
all


religion
to
the
hindu
is
the
search
for
the
divine
within
the
self
the
search
to
find
the
one
truth
that
really
never
was
lost


according
to
this
belief
somebody
looking
for
truth
will
find
it
no
matter
who
they
are


everything
that
exists
from
vegetables
and
animals
to
mankind
are
subjects
and
objects
of
the
<collocation>eternal dharma</collocation>


this
inner
faith
therefore
is
also
known
as
noble
dharma
veda
<collocation>knowledge dharma</collocation>
yoga
union
dharma
hindu
dharma
or
simply
the
dharma


what
can
be
said
to
be
common
to
all
hindus
is
belief
in
dharma
reincarnation
karma
and
liberation
of
every
soul
through
a
variety
of
moral
and
meditative


still
more
basic
principles
include
the
importance
of
the
guru
the
divine
word
of
and
the
power
of
mantras
love
of
truth
in
many
manifestations
as
gods
and
and
an
understanding
that
the
essential
spark
of
the
divine
atman
brahman
is
in
every
human
and
living
being
allowing
for
many
spiritual
paths
leading
to

and

origins
and
aspects
of
society
little
is
known
about
hinduism
origins


it
has
been
around
since
before
history
was
written
down


it
has
been
said
to
have
come
from
what
the
aryans
believed


before
the
aryans
came
to
india
there
were
the
hundreds
of
faith
and
beliefs
of
and
living
in
the
indian
subcontinent


they
came
together
under
the
hindu
name
during
the
british
raj

ideas
of
where
the
veda
come
from
and
understandings
of
whether
or
not
the
aryans
were
native
or
foreign
to
indian
soil
can
change
estimates
of
hinduism
age
from
to
years


historically
the
word
hindu
comes
from
before
hinduism
was
thought
of
as
a
religion


this
term
is
of
persian
origin
and
first
referred
to
people
who
lived
on
the
other
side
from
a
persian
point
of
view
of
the
or
indus
river


it
was
used
to
refer
to
not
only
ethnicity
but
also
the
vedic
religion
as
far
back
as
the
and
centuries
by
such
figures
as
guru
who
started
sikhism


during
the
british
raj
the
term
use
was
made
standard
and
eventually
the
religion
of
the
vedic
hindus
was
given
the
name
hinduism


in
actuality
it
was
merely
a
new
name
for
a
culture
that
had
been
around
for
millennia
before

society
caste
according
to
one
view
the
caste
system
shows
how
strongly
many
have
felt
about
each
person
following
his
or
her
dharma
or
destined
path


many
hindus
say
it
goes
against
the
true
meaning
of
dharma


however
caste
plays
a
big
role
in
hindu
society
although
it
is
now
losing
favor
and
is
illegal
in
india


in
early
<collocation>vedic periods</collocation>
the
began
not
letting
young
candidates
become
priests
if
they
were
in
a
lower
caste


this
became
more
part
of
the
culture
over
centuries
until
it
became
almost
impossible
to
move
up
into
a
higher
caste
