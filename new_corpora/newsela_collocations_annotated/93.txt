says
how

run


every

signed

says


most
importantly
it
says
which

do
for

and
which
jobs
they
should
do
themselves


the

decide
how

of

is
to
bring
its

this
with

with

the

were
one
of
the
most
advanced

greece
is
famous
for
its
many
philosophers
like
plato
and
aristotle
and
kings
like
alexander
the
great
and


greece
is
said
to
be
the
birthplace
of
democracy
because
like
athens
now
the
capital
of
greece
were
the
first
to
elect
their
leaders
and
not
have
kings


during
the
years
of
alexander
the
great
a
huge
greek
empire
was
created
that
stretched
from
greece
to
egypt
and
iran
until
the
borders
of
india


because
of
the
significant
role
that
greek
culture
played
during
that
time
it
is
called
the
hellenistic
period
or
period


during

the

the

that

today
as

greece

the

are
greeks
and
they

another
of
the
country


the
greek
government
recognizes
only
one
minority
in
the
country
the
turkish
one
in
the
region
of


the
dispute
between

and
the
republic
of
macedonia
has
caused
result
the
refusal
of

but
greece
says
that
if

country
it
would
not
be
more
than
people
in
the
northern
part
of
the
country
near
the
border
with
the
republic
of
macedonia


this
is
also
supported
by
international
organizations


greek
flag
main
flag
of
greece
the
greek
flag
is
blue
and
white


the
greek
flag
was
officially
adopted
in
as
a
civil
and
state
ensign
a
flag
for
use
only
on
boats
and
ships
and
as
a
national
flag
when
flown
outside
of
greece
for
example
on
embassies


a
different
flag
white
cross
on
a
blue
field
was
used
as
a
land
flag
within
greece
from
until
and
from
to


in
the
current
flag
became
national
flag
and
the
older
land
flag
was
abolished


there
are
many
theories
about
the
origin
of
the
color
of
the
flag


one
says
that
the
blue
represents
the
color
of
the
sea
and
the
white
represents
the
waves
and
others
include
white
for
the
waves
and
blue
for
the
sky
and
white
for
purity
and
breakaway
from
tyranny
and
blue
for
greece


there
are
nine
stripes
on
the
flag
which
according
to
the
legend
represent
the
nine
syllables
in
the
phrase
which
means
freedom
or
death


the
cross
stands
for
christianity


economy
the
money
used
in
greece
is
called
the
euro


greece
is
a
capitalist
country
like
the
united
states
and
france


greece
has
the
largest
number
of
trading
ships
a
merchant
navy
in
the
world


tourism
is
also
a
major
source
of
income
for
greece


in
the
century
greece
had
its
own
currency
but
now
uses
the
euro
as
most
other
european
community
countries
do


greece
has
adopted
some
welfare
state
policies
such
as
public
healthcare
and
free
education
like
many
other
european
countries


the
pension
system
of
greece
has
created
serious
problems
for
the
whole
country


the
fact
is
that
thousands
of
greeks
are
retired
before
the
age
of


the
government
has
been
very
popular
by
adjusting
the
retirement
age
several
times


currently
the
average
age
of
retirement
is
for
women
and
for
men


this
is
putting
greece
in
a
very
difficult
situation
when
the
country
has
accumulated
a
debt
of
about
billion
or
debt
by
of
the
country
total


greece
also
has
a
deficit
meaning
that
it
buys
more
things
than
it
sells


the
country
is
cutting
costs
and
asking
for
loans
in
order
to
avoid
bankruptcy


tourism
about
million
tourists
visit
greece
each
year


that
is
more
than
the
country
entire
population


since
there
are
so
many
tourist
in
greece
it
has
many
international
airports
