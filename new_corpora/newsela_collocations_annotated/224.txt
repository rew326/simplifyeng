modern
houses
are
often
made
of
parts
that
are
partly
built
in
a
factory
and
are
easy
to
put
together
at
the
site
of
the
building


many
different
types
of
materials
for
making
houses
have
been
developed
in
the
century


many
houses
are
now
made
with
steel
frames
put
together
with
rivets
and
bolts


walls
and
roofs
can
be
made
of
boards
that
combine
fiber
with
cement


these
boards
are
thin
light
in
weight
to
transport
easy
to
put
on
the
frame
and
much
cheaper
than
bricks
or
timber

a
constellation
is
a
group
of
stars
usually
in
a
recognizable
shape
or
pattern


together
the
stars
look
like
a
picture


the
word
constellation
comes
from
latin
con
meaning
together
and
stella
meaning
stars


some
examples
of
constellations
are
<collocation>ursa major</collocation>
orion
and
andromeda


people
used
constellations
to
tell
the
difference
in
the
colors


constellations
were
also
used
to
group
stars


different
places
in
the
world
may
have
different
constellations
but
today
astronomy
has
a
fixed
set
of
constellations


this
set
is
based
on
the
greek
set
and
later
some
southern
constellations
were
added
for
example
the
air
pump


most
constellations
have
names
that

greek
mythology
like
orion
or
andromeda

the
carrier
of
a
serpent
which
the
sun
goes
through


however
most
people
do
not
think
that
it
is
in
the
zodiac


history
no
one
knows
who
first
saw
the
constellations


ancient
civilizations
like
the
mayans
drew
their
own
star
maps
of
the
skies
with
their
constellations
very
few
of
which

the

christian
beliefs
about
hell
in
christianity
hell
is
usually
the
place
where
the
souls
of
people
go
who
did
not
accept
jesus
or
broke
important
rules
set
forth
by
god


in
hell
souls
suffer
and
wait
for
the
<collocation>last judgement</collocation>
a
time
when
the
souls
of
the
dead
will
be
judged
by
god


the
concept
of
hell
in
christianity
comes
from
the
bible
and
the
casting
out
of
lucifer


in
being
cast
out
he
was
removed
from
the
presence
of
god


therefore
if
taken
in
its
most
<collocation>literal sense</collocation>
hell
is
separation
from
god


stated
another
way
to
the
christian
mind
being
separated
from
god
is
to
be
in
hell


some
christians
believe
that
hell
has
real
fire
and
flames
but
others
do
not


many
christian
groups
believe
that
once
a
soul
goes
to
hell
it
stays
there
forever
and
can
not
leave


however
some
christian
groups
do
not
believe
this


mormons
for
example
think
hell
is
only
a
temporary
place
and
that
souls
may
leave
hell
at
some
point


other
christians
believe
that
those
who
do
not
go
to
heaven
simply
stop
existing
and
do
not
go
to
hell


these
christians
are
called


other
religions
beliefs
about
hell
anchor
underworld
many
religions
and
mythologies
use
the
term
underworld
for
the
place
where
people
believe
they
or
their
souls
would
go
after
they
die


the
ancient
greeks
believed
that
souls
would
go
to
different
places
within
the
underworld


one
of
those
places
called
was
like
hell


the
god
hades
was
the
ruler
of
the
underworld


the
most
famous
story
about
the
underworld
is
the
greek
mythological
story
of
orpheus


in
the
culture
of
ancient
rome
the
god
of
the
underworld
was
called
pluto
a
name
which
meant
the
wealthy
one
because
there
were
lots
of
minerals
under
the
ground


the
romans
first
thought
of
the
underworld
as
a
place
but
later
the
influence
of
christianity
made
them
think
that
hell
was
a
place
of
punishment


in
buddhism
there
are
three
types
of
hells
called


unlike
in
judaism
and
christianity
souls
are
born
into
these
places
based
on
their
karma


they
spend
a
certain
amount
of
time
there
and
are
then
reborn
somewhere
else


in
islam
hell
is
called
and
it
is
a
place
of
punishment


however
some
muslims
believe
almost
everyone
will
eventually
be
forgiven
and
taken
to
the
islamic
heaven


the
only
people
who
will
not
be
forgiven
are
those
who
choose
to
believe
in
many
gods
or
no
god
at
all


fact
date
july
in
hell
is
similar
to
the
greek
hades
in
that
all
souls
go
there
no
matter
their
actions
in
life
to
have
a
miserable
existence
forever

history
the
first
stone
circle
was
a
set
of


the
holes
held
up
to
standing
stones
shown
blue
on
the
plan
only
of
which
can
be
traced
today


the
made
of
an
igneous
rock
were
thought
for
much
of
the
century
to
have
been
brought
from
the
hills
convert
mi
off
away
in
wales


another
theory
is
that
they
were
brought
much
nearer
to
the
site
as
glacial
by
the
irish
sea
glacier


later
huge
gray
stones
were
brought
to
the
site


they
were
erected
in
a
circle
metres
in
diameter
with
lintels
on
top
of
the
standing
stones


the
remaining
blue
circles
were
placed
as
an
inner
circle


the
site
was
in
use
until
the
<collocation>bronze age</collocation>


the
modern
stonehenge
consists
entirely
of
original
stones
some
of
which
have
been
replaced
in
upright
position


there
are
also
several
<collocation>passage tombs</collocation>
and
many
nearby


no
one
knows
who
built
stonehenge
or
why
they
built
it


during

sunrise
lines
up
