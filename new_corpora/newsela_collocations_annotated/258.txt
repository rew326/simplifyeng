history
the
society
of
friends
began
in
the
in
england


a
man
named
george
fox
went
around
preaching
his
ideas
to
people
including
a
large
group
on
hill


he
told
them
they
could
talk
to
god
themselves
that
they
did
not
need
a
priest
or
minister
to
do
it
for
them


many
people
liked
this
idea
they
found
it
helped
them
feel
close
to
god


together
they
started
the
society
of
friends


the
government
of
england
did
not
like
this
new
religion
at
the
time
it
was
against
the
law
not
to
belong
to
the
church
of
england


they
put
a
lot
of
people
in
jail
or
made
them
pay
money
as
a
punishment


at
first
the
word
quaker
was
a
name
used
to
make
fun
of
people
who
belonged
to
the
society
of
friends
but
after
a
while
those
people
came
to
like
it
and
use
it
for
themselves


because
quakers
were
being
thrown
in
jail
in
england
some
of
them
moved
away
to
places
like
america


a
young
quaker
named
william
started
a
new
colony
there
he
got
the
land
because
the
english
king
charles
ii
owed
his
father
a
lot
of
money


this
new
colony
was
called
pennsylvania
and
it
was
made
to
be
a
place
where
anyone
could
be
free
to
belong
to
any
religion


wanted
people
to
be
fair
to
each
other
and
he
called
the
biggest
city
in
his
new
colony
philadelphia
which
means
the
city
of
<collocation>brotherly love</collocation>


soon
there
were
many
quakers
in
america


the
quakers
were
very
active
in
america
in
the
<collocation>nineteenth century</collocation>


many
of
the
leaders
of
the
abolition
and
women
right
movement
such
as
<collocation>elizabeth cady</collocation>
and
mott
were
quakers


today
there
are
about
quakers
in
the
world


this
number
is
very
small
compared
to
other
religious
groups


even
so
a
lot
of
people
have
heard
of
the
quakers
because
they
are
good
at
letting
people
know
what
they
believe


<collocation>worship quakers</collocation>
worship
in
meetings
for
worship
and
at
other
times
these
meetings
also
decide
what
quakers
should
do
these
meetings
can
be
called
meetings
for
business
but
other
people
call
them
meetings
for
worship
for
business
because
they
include
parts
of
both
worship
and
business


anyone
can
go
to
a
quaker
meeting
because
most
quakers
think
that
everyone
is
equal
and
that
this
is
a
very
important
idea


there
are
two
types
of
quakers
members
are
definitely
part
of
the
religious
society
of
friends
and
might
just
be
wondering
whether
quakerism
is
right
for
them


in
practice
both
tend
to
be
treated
the
same


usually
a
meeting
for
worship
lasts
about
an
hour


it
starts
with
everybody
sitting
quietly
often
in
a
circle


this
is
because
they
are
trying
to
listen
to
god


sometimes
a
quaker
will
think
that
god
wants
him
or
her
to
say
something


when
this
happens
the
person
stands
up
to
tell
everyone


then
they
all
sit
quietly
again


at
some
meetings
a
large
number
of
people
will
speak


at
other
meetings
nobody
speaks


quakers
believe
that
a
meeting
for
worship
helps
them
to
understand
what
god
wants


at
these
meetings
each
quaker
will
have
a
slightly
different
idea
of
what
it
means
to
them
to
listen
to
god
and
each
quaker
will
go
about
doing
it
in
a
different
way

will
have
together

some

ask
a
pastor
to
talk
about
something
interesting


they
also
have
quiet
times

they
do
not
last
as
long

have
strong
christian

an
inner

light
comes
from
