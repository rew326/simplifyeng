sociology
became
a
type
of
science
in
the
early


european
cities
were
changing
as
many
people
moved
into
cities
and
began
working
in
factories


sociologists
tried
to
understand
how
people
interacted
and
how
groups
interacted


the
word
sociology
was
invented
by
a
french
thinker
called
auguste
comte
in


early
thinkers
who
wrote
about
sociology
included
marx
and
max
weber


sociology
was
taught
in
a
university
for
the
first
time
at
the
university
of
kansas
in


the
first
european
department
of

the
sky
is
what
we
call
the
appearance
of
a
hemisphere
over
our
heads


on
a
clear
day
it
appears
blue


the
deepness
of
the
blue
increases
as
we
look
toward
the
horizon
and
up
to
the
point
above
us


the
sky
which
is
made
up
of
gas
molecules
is
blue
because
of
the
random
scattering
of
sunlight
by
the
molecules


scattering
defines
the
amount
of
scattering
of
light
rays


since
all
colors
of
the
rainbow
create
a
white
light
we
should
see
a
white
sky
but
blue
light
scatters
much
more
than
red


that
is
why
the
sky
appears
blue
on
a
cloudless
day

language
different

like
in

not
as
many
will
change
the
meaning
of
the
words
even
if
the
pronunciation
of
the
word
is
the
same
otherwise


english
and
almost
all
other
european

are

is
important


that

a
word
meaning
could
be
different
depending
on
which
syllable
is
stressed


examples
include
swedish
norwegian
and
lithuanian


japanese
has
a
similar
system


an

of

means

if

include
numbers
that

the

it
can
be
written
like
which

<collocation>mother scolds</collocation>

some
write
each

a
different

so
would
be

most
use
numbers

marks
in


some
tones
may
sound
alike
to
people
who
do
not
speak
a

language

are
easy

so
tone
is
the
most

for
many
people


tonal
<collocation>markings vietnamese</collocation>
and
use
accents
as
the
tone
marks
for
the
latin

each
marking
defines
an

most
syllables
only
have
one
tone
marking


but
the
letters
in
the
syllable
can
be
altered
by
other
special

so
more
markings
can
be

each

syllables
usually
form
one

un

compound

may
have

making
beer
the
act
of
making
beer
is
called
brewing


beer
is
made
by
adding
warm
water
to
malted
barley
and
other
grains


the
enzymes
in
the
barley
change
the
malted
barley
and
other
grains
into
simple
sugars


this
is
called
the
mash


the
water
is
then
drained
from
the
grain


the
water
is
now
called
wort


the
wort
is
boiled
and
hops
are
added


hops
provide
flavor
and
preserve
the
beer


after
boiling
the
wort
is
cooled
and
yeast
is
added


the
yeast
turns
the
sugars
into
alcohol
and
the
wort
into
beer


different

adding

these

different
countries
have
different
ways
to
make

in
germany
austria
switzerland
czech
republic
and
beer
is
usually
made
from
just
hops
malt
water

this

because
of
the


the
was
a
law
that
said
says
that
beer
can
only
be
made
from
hops
malt
and
water


yeast
was
discovered
after
the


the
law
was
overturned
by
the
european
union
in


in
belgium
however
beers
have
always
been
made
with
wheat
sugar
fruit
and
other
ingredients


different
ways
to
make
beer
the
type
of
yeast
used
determines
the
kind
of
beer
made
some
kinds
of
<collocation>yeast ferment</collocation>

by

said
that
the
discovered
the
fermentation
process
by
accident


it
is
not
known
exactly
how
this
happened
but
it
could
be
that
a
piece
of
bread
or
grain
became
wet
and
a
short
time
later
it
began
to
ferment
and
made
a
pulp
that
caused
people
to
become
drunk


a

around
years
old
is
a
sumerian
hymn
to
the
goddess
of

this
hymn
is
also
a
recipe
for
making
beer


a
description
of
the
making
of
beer
on
this
ancient
engraving
in
the
sumerian
language
is
the
earliest
account
of
what
is
easily
recognized
as
barley
followed
by
a
pictograph
of
bread
being
baked
crumbled
into
water
to
form
a
mash
and
then
made
into
a
drink
that
is
recorded
as
having
made
people
feel
wonderful
and
blissful


it
could
even
be
possible
that
bread
was
first
baked
to
be
a
way
to
make
beer
that
is
easy
to
carry
around


the
were
probably
the
first
people
to
brew
beer


they
had
found
a
divine
drink
they
felt
it
was
a
gift
from
the
gods


amount
of
alcohol
in

normal
beers
have
around
alcohol
for
the
volume

there
is
alcohol


in
<collocation>brewing beer</collocation>
the
amount
of
alcohol
can
be
made
more
or
less
quite
easily


the
belgian
types
of
beer
are
made
by
adding
more
sugar


through
the
fermentation
this
will
then
turn
to
alcohol


today
there
are
beers
with
between
and
about
of
alcohol
about
the
same
alcohol
content
as
wine


spirits
can
have
up
to
alcohol


some
<collocation>beer labels</collocation>
say
there
is
no
alcohol
in
them
because
it
was
taken
out
later


this
is
not
completely
true
though


beers
without
alcohol
usually
do
have
less
than
of
