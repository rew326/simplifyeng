in

by

the

were

an
illustration
of
the
random
way
gas
molecules
move
without
being
attached
to
each
other


a
gas
is
one
of
the
four
most
common
states
of
matter


in
a
gas
the
molecules
move
freely
and
are
independent
of
each
other


this
makes
it
different
from
a
liquid
where
the
molecules
are
loosely
attached
or
from
a
solid
where
the
bonds
are
strong
and
hold
the
molecules
together


gases
can
be
pure
where
each
molecule
is
made
of
individual
atoms
elemental
where
each
molecule
is
made
of
more
than
one
of
the
same
atom
bound
together
or
compounds
where
molecules
are
made
of
many
types
of
atoms
together


an
example
of
a
pure
gas
is
neon
an
example
of
an
elemental
gas
is
hydrogen
and
an
example
of
a
compound
gas
could
be
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>


a
gas
broken
link
mixture
mixture
contains
a
mix
of
any
of
the
above
types
for
example
air
which
is
nitrogen
oxygen
and
argon

physical
characteristics
all
gases
can
flow
like
liquids


this
means
the
molecules
move
about
independently
of
each
other


the
majority
of
gases
are
colourless
like
hydrogen


gas
particles
will
spread
about
or
diffuse
in
order
to
fill
all
the
space
in
any
container
such
as
a
bottle
or
a
room


compared
to
liquids
and
solids
gases
have
a
very
low
density
and
viscosity


we
can
not
directly
observe
most
gases
since
they
are
without
color
however
it
is
possible
to
measure
their
density
volume
temperature
and
pressure


pressure
main
pressure
pressure
is
the
measure
of
how
much
pushing
force
something
is
putting
on
another
object


in
a
gas
this
is
usually
the
gas
pushing
on
the
container
of
the
object
or
if
the
gas
is
heavy
something
inside
the
gas


pressure
is
measure
in


because
of
newton
third
law
we
can
change
the
pressure
of
a
gas
by
putting
force
on
the
object
containing
it


for
example
squeezing
a
bottle
with
air
inside
pressurizes
gives
more
pressure
to
the
air
inside


pressure
when
talking
about
gas
is
often
related
to
the
container


a
lot
of
gas
in
a
small
container
would
have
a
very
high
pressure


a
small
amount
of
a
gas
in
a
big
container
would
have
a
low
pressure


gas
can
<collocation>crate pressure</collocation>
itself
when
there
is
a
lot
of
it


the
weight
of
all
the
gas
above
creates
high
pressure
on
any
object
underneath
it
including
any
more
gas


on
a
planet
this
is
called
atmospheric
pressure


temperature
main
temperature
the
temperature
of
a
gas
is
how
hot
or
cold
it
is


in
science
it
is
usually
measured
in
although
the
everyday
unit
degrees
is
more
common


in
a
gas
the
average
velocity
of
the
molecules
is
related
to
the
temperature


the
faster
the
gas
molecules
are
moving
the
more
they
broken
link
collision
collide
or
smash
into
each
other


these
collisions
make
energy
which
in
a
gas
comes
in
the
form
of
heat


conversely
if
the
temperature
around
the
gas
becomes
hotter
then
the
gas
particles
will
convert
the
thermal
energy
to
<collocation>kinetic energy</collocation>
making
them
move
faster
and
making
the
gas
hotter


state
changes
a
gas
can
go
through
two
different
state
changes


if
the
temperature
is
low
enough
the
gas
can
condense
and
turn
into
a
liquid


sometimes
if
the
temperature
is
low
enough
it
can
go
through
deposition
where
it
changes
straight
to
a
solid


normally
a
gas
must
first
condense
to
a
liquid
and
then
freeze
to
become
a
solid
but
if
the
temperature
is
very
low
it
can
skip
the
liquid
stage
and
instantly
become
solid


frost
on
the
ground
in
winter
is
caused
by
this


water
vapor
a
gas
goes
into
the
air
which
is
very
cold
and
instantly
becomes
ice
due
to
deposition

biology
a
family
is
a
group
of
people
who
live
together


they
share
the
housework
and
take
care
of
one
another


types
of
families
three
types
of
family
are
nuclear
family
family
and
extended
family


a
nuclear
family
is
made
up
of
father
mother
and
one
or
more
children
living
together


a
family
is
one
where
either
the
mother
or
father
is
caring
for
the
children
in
the
family


both
the
nuclear
family
and
the
family
are
also
called
the
immediate
family


extended
family
means
father
mother
children
grandparents
uncles
aunts
cousins
nieces
and
nephews


in
the
united

there
are
some
circumstances
where
the
extended
family
comes
to
live
either
with
or
in
place
of
a
member
of
the
nuclear
family


but
in
most
cases
in
the

the

no

lives

a
weapon
is
an
object
that
can
be
used
to
attack
or
injure
a
person
or
animal


people
have
used
weapons
since
very
ancient
times


some
of
the
oldest
remains
that
we
have
of
ancient
people
are
weapons
made
of
stone


ancient
people
also
used
spears
and
bows
and
arrows


after
people
learned
to
make
things
of
metal
many
people
used
swords


people
also
built
huge
machines
which
could
throw
rocks
to
destroy
the
defensive
walls
of
enemy
cities


some
of
these
machines
were
called
catapults
or
siege
engines


later
gunpowder
was
invented
in
china
and
the
europeans
began
using
it
to
make
guns
and
cannons


these
weapons
were
much
better
than
the
older
weapons
and
helped
the
europeans
to
conquer
people
in
many
parts
of
the
world


people
in
many
parts
of
the
world
used
guns
such
as
rifles
and
shotguns
for
hunting
animals
and
handguns
for
shooting
other
people


people
continued
to
invent
new
weapons


in
the
<collocation>machine gun</collocation>
was
invented
which
could
shoot
many
bullets
very
fast


soldiers
began
to
use
land
mines
a
bomb
hidden
in
the
ground
which
explodes
when
someone
walks
on
it


small
submarines
were
able
to
use
to
attack
bigger
ships
and
hide
under
the
ocean


when
airplanes
were
invented
people
began
to
use
them
to
shoot
enemies
and
to
drop
bombs
on
them


they
built
tanks
which
had
big
guns
and
strong
armor


poison

was
used
in
<collocation>world war</collocation>
i
but
was
outlawed
and
rarely
used
afterwards


in

ii
cities
were

ii
people
continued
to
develop
new
weapons
including
intercontinental
ballistic
missiles


people
became
concerned
about
weapons
of
mass
destruction
weapons
that
can
kill
many
people
very
fast
and
are
usually
cheap
and
easy
to
make
and
use


one
kind
of
weapon
of
mass
destruction
is
poison
gas


new
kinds
of
poison
gas
such
as
nerve
gas
are
much
more
powerful
than
the
old
kinds


another
kind
of
weapon
of
mass
destruction
is
disease
germs
which
could
be
used
to
make
many
people
sick
and
maybe
kill
them


weapons
still
kill
many
people
in
wars
and
fighting


in
wars
in
africa
in
the
and
early
century
many
people
were
killed
with
machetes
big
knives


people
sometimes
try
to
make
laws
treaties
and
international
agreements
to
try
to
control
weapons
because
they
are
worried
about
all
the
killing
done
with
them


laws
vary
from
country
to
country
for
example
in
the
united
states
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
guaranteed
to
all
citizens
by
the
constitution


a
country
may
say
that
people
in
that
country
can
not
keep
or
use
guns
or
only
when
the
government
allows
it


the
laws
of
war
forbid
certain
weapons
and
countries
may
agree
with
each
other
that
they
should
not
use
certain
weapons
against
each
other
