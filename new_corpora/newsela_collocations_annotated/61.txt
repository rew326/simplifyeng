or
more

shape


a
is
a
single
<collocation>linear polymer</collocation>
chain
of
amino
acids


the
sequence
of
amino
acids
in
a
comes
from
the
sequence
of
a
gene


the
genetic
code
specifies
standard
amino
acids


shortly
after
synthesis
some
amino
acids
are
chemically
modified


this
alters
the
folding
stability
activity
and
function
of
the
protein


sometimes
proteins
have
groups
attached
as


proteins
are
essential
to
all
cells


like
other
biological
and
<collocation>nucleic acids</collocation>
proteins
take
part
in
virtually
every
process
in
cells
many
proteins
are
enzymes
that
catalyze
<collocation>biochemical reactions</collocation>
and
are
vital
to
metabolism


other
proteins
have
structural
or
mechanical
functions
such
as
in
muscle
and
in
cells


the
is
a
system
of
scaffolding
that
keeps
cell
shape


other
proteins
are
important
in
cell
signalling
<collocation>immune responses</collocation>
and
cell
division

proteins
for
humans
egg
whites
contain
a
lot
of
protein
proteins
do
different
things
depending
on
their
shape


they
can
be
found
in
meat
or
muscle


they
are
used
for
growth
and
repair
as
well
as
for
strengthening
the
bones


they
help
to
make
tissue
and
cells


they
are
in
animals
plants
fungi
bacteria
and
also
in
the
human
body


muscles
contain
a
lot
of
protein


when
protein
is
digested
it
is
broken
down
into
its
amino
acids


these
amino
acids
can
then
be
used
to
build
new
protein


proteins
form
an
important
part
in
foods
like
milk
eggs
meat
fish
beans
and
nuts


there
are
four
things
that
determine
what
a
protein
will
do


the
first
is
the
order
of
the
amino
acids


there
are
amino
acids
and
they
are
all
a
bit
different


the
second
is
the
little
twists
in
the
chain


the
third
is
how
the
entire
thing
is
folded
up


the
fourth
is
whether
it
is
made
up
of
different


<collocation>haemoglobin molecules</collocation>
for
example
are
made
of
four


<collocation>essential amino</collocation>
<collocation>acids proteins</collocation>
are
necessary
in
animals
diets
since
animals
can
not
make
all
the
amino
acids
they
need
they
can
make
most
of
them


they
must
get
certain
amino
acids
from
food


these
are
called
the
<collocation>essential amino</collocation>
acids


through
digestion
animals
break
down
ingested
protein
into
free
amino
acids


the
amino
acids
are
then
used
in
metabolism
to
make
the
enzymes
and
structures
the
body
needs


there
are
nine
<collocation>essential amino</collocation>
acids
for
humans
which
must
be
got
from
food


meat
contains
all
the
<collocation>essential amino</collocation>
acids
humans
need
most
plants
do
not


however
eating
a
mixture
of
plants
such
as
both
wheat
and
peanut
butter
or
rice
and
beans
provides
all
the
<collocation>essential amino</collocation>
acids
needed


<collocation>soy products</collocation>
like
tofu
provide
all
the
<collocation>essential amino</collocation>
acids
but
are
not
the
only
way
to
get
the
protein
you
need


the
scientist
jacob
gave
proteins
their
name
but
many
other
scientists
have
studied
proteins

the
<collocation>periodic table</collocation>
of
the
chemical
elements
is
a
list
of
known
atoms


in
the
table
the
elements
are
placed
in
the
order
of
their
atomic
numbers
starting
with
the
lowest
number


the
atomic
number
of
an
element
is
the
same
as
the
number
of
electrons
or
protons
in
that
particular
atom


in
the
<collocation>periodic table</collocation>
the
elements
are
arranged
into
periods
and
groups


a
row
of
elements
across
the
table
is
called
a
period


each
period
has
a
number
from
to


period
has
only
elements
in
it
hydrogen
and
helium


period
and
period
both
have
elements


other
periods
are
longer


a
column
of
elements
down
the
table
is
called
a
group


there
are
groups
in
the
standard
<collocation>periodic table</collocation>


each
group
has
a
number
from
to


elements
in
a
group
have
electrons
arranged
in
similar
ways
which
gives
them
similar
chemical
properties
they
behave
in
similar
ways


for
example
group
is
known
as
the
<collocation>noble gases</collocation>
because
they
are
all
gases
and
they
do
not
combine
with
other
atoms


the
<collocation>periodic table</collocation>
can
be
used
by
chemists
to
observe
patterns
and
relationships
between
the
elements


for
example
elements
to
the
bottom
and
far
left
of
the
table
are
the
most
metallic
and
elements
on
the
top
right
are
the
least
metallic


cesium
is
much
more
metallic
than
helium


there
are
also
many
other
patterns
and
relationships


there
are
three
systems
of
group
numbers
one
using
arabic
numerals
and
the
other
two
using
roman
numerals
i
ii
iii


the
<collocation>roman numeral</collocation>
names
were
used
at
first
and
are
the
traditional
names
the
arabic
numeral
names
are
newer
names
that
the
international
union
of
pure
and
applied
chemistry
decided
to
use
as
well


the
names
were
meant
to
replace
the
older
<collocation>roman numeral</collocation>
systems
as
they
used
the
same
names
to
mean
different
things
which
was
confusing


the
<collocation>periodic table</collocation>
was
invented
and
arranged
by
the
russian
chemist

physiology
is
the
study
of
how
living
things
work


physiologists
can
study
how
organs
of
an
organism
work
together
to
make
things
happen


in
human
beings
for
example
the
digestion
of
food
hormones
and
other
chemicals
are
made
by
the
stomach
liver
and
pancreas


muscle
contraction
happens
because
of
chemical
messages
made
by
nerves
of
that
muscle


by
learning
how
the
body
functions
normally
physiologists
and
physicians
can
better
understand
what
happens
when
organs
do
not
function
normally


for
example
an
understanding
of
how
the
thyroid
<collocation>gland functions</collocation>
has
helped
in
treating


studies
of
the
circulatory
system
and
the
nervous
system
have
helped
physicians
understand
and
treat
such
illnesses
like
heart

<collocation>police officers</collocation>
police
are
a
group
of
people
whose
job
it
is
to
enforce
laws
help
with
emergencies
solve
crimes
and
protect
the
public


people
who
work
for
the
police
are
called
<collocation>police officers</collocation>


they
work
out
of
a
police
station


police
are
trained
in
first
aid
and
rescue
because
<collocation>police officers</collocation>
are
often
one
of
the
first
people
to
get
to
a
place
where
people
are
sick
or
injured
such
as
a
car
accident
or
a
fire

powers
the
police
have
different
powers
to
help
them
do
their
job


these
powers
are
different
in
different
countries


most
<collocation>police officers</collocation>
have
the
power
to
arrest
people
search
people
and
search
houses
properties


they
sometimes
carry
equipment
such
as
guns
batons
and
<collocation>pepper spray</collocation>


the
area
where
a
police
officer
can
use
these
powers
is
called
their
jurisdiction


if
the
officer
goes
outside
of
his
jurisdiction
they
are
no
longer
allowed
to
use
his
powers


another
police
force
has
to
then
take
over


duties
the
police
deal
with
stopping
crime
and
protecting
the
public


they
do
this
by
patrolling
on
foot
in
uniform
and
in
police
cars


it
is
often
agreed
that
seeing
<collocation>police officers</collocation>
makes
people
feel
safer
and
that
it
stops
some
some
forms
of
criminal
behavior


this
means
that
they
find
out
who
did
the
crime


some
crimes
such
as
robbery
or
murder
are
investigated
by
detectives


to
help
in
emergencies
or
problems
the
that
are
not
crimes


they
could
go
to
car
accidents
fires
or
people
who
are
sick
or
hurt


the
police
work
with
firefighters
ambulances
and
rescuers


they
could
direct

children
give
traffic
tickets
and
many
other
things


parts
of
police
departments
most
police
departments
have
most
of
their
officers
in
two
main
groups
a
patrol
group
that
has
officers
who
wear
uniforms
and
a
detective
group
that
has
officers
who
wear
normal
clothing


<collocation>patrol officers</collocation>
travel
through
their
area
to
see
what
is
happening


they
drive
marked
cars
with
warning
lights
and
sirens
makes
sound
to
warn
people


<collocation>patrol officers</collocation>
also
enforce
traffic
regulations
and
run
the
local
jail


detectives
work
on
investigations
that
are
more
complex


they
try
to
find
fraud
illegal
drugs
and
sex
crimes
like
prostitution
and
rape


prostitution
is
not
a
crime
in
all
countries


not

pi
is
equal

the
circumference
divided

pi
is
an
endless
string
of
numbers


see

<collocation>pie pi</collocation>
or
pi
is
a
mathematical
constant
one
of
the
first
ever
discovered


it
is
the
ratio
of
the
distance
around
a
circle
to
the
circle
diameter


this
produces
a
number
and
that
number
is
always
the
same


however
the
number
is
rather
strange


the
number
starts
and
continues
without
end


such
numbers
are
called
irrational


the
diameter
is
the
longest
line
which
can
be
fitted
inside
a
circle


it
passes
through
the
center
of
the
circle


the
distance
around
a
circle
is
known
as
the
circumference


even
though
the
diameter
and
circumference
are
different
for
different
circles
the
number
pi
remains
constant
its
value
never
changes


this
is
because
the
relationship
between
the
circumference
and
diameter
is
always
the

a
diagram
showing
how
pi
can
be
found
by
using
a
circle
with
a
diameter
of
one


the
circumference
of
this
circle
is
pi


pi
is
often
written
formally
as
pi
or
the
greek
letter
as
a
shortcut


pi
is
also
an
irrational
number
meaning
it
can
not
be
written
as
a
fraction
a
over
b
where
a
and
b
are
integers
whole
numbers


this
basically
means
that
the
digits
of
pi
that
are
to
the
right
of
the
decimal
go
forever
without
repeating
in
a
pattern
and
that
it
is
impossible
to
write
the
exact
value
of
pi
as
a
number


pi
can
only
be
approximated
or
measured
to
a
value
that
is
close
enough
for
<collocation>practical purposes</collocation>


a
value
close
to
pi
is
a
common
<collocation>fraction approximation</collocation>
of
pi
is
over
which
yields
approximately


this
approximation
is
away
from
the
true
value
of
pi


while
this
approximation
is
accepted
for
most
of
its
use
in
real
life
the
fraction
over
is
more
accurate
giving
about
and
can
be
used
when
a
value
closer
to
pi
is
needed


computers
can
be
used
to
get
better
approximations
of
pi


history
value
of
pi
was
known
to
ancient
indian
like
and


mathematicians
have
known
about
pi
for
thousands
of
years
because
they
have
been
working
with
circles
for
the
same
amount
of
time


civilizations
as
old
as
the
babylonians
have
been
able
to
approximate
pi
to
many
digits
such
as
the
fraction
and


most
historians
believe
that
ancient
egyptians
had
no
concept
of
and
that
the
correspondence
is
a
coincidence


the
first
written
reference
to
it
dates
to


around
the
egyptian
gave
a
value
in
the
papyrus


the
babylonians
were
able
to
find
that
the
value
of
pi
was
slightly
greater
than
by
simply
making
a
big
circle
and
then
sticking
a
piece
of
rope
onto
the
circumference
and
the
diameter
taking
note
of
their
distances
and
then
dividing
the
circumference
by
the
diameter


knowledge
of
the
number
pi
passed
back
into
europe
and
into
the
hands
of
the
hebrews
who
made
the
number
important
in
a
section
of
the
bible
called
the
<collocation>old testament</collocation>
