since
the
surface
of
the
star
will
get
bigger
this
energy
will
be
spread
out
over
a
much
larger
area


because
of
this
the
temperature
of
the
surface
will
go
down
and
the

will
change
to
red

orange


it
will

the

was

stops
burning


a

of

is
given
off

called
a

is
left
behind


after
a
really
long
time
the
white
dwarf
cools
down
into
a
black
dwarf


but
when
a
big
red
giant
explodes
the
explosion
is
a

larger
and
is
called
a
supernova


instead
of
a
white
dwarf
it
leaves
behind
a
much
smaller
much
denser
ball
called
a
neutron
star


a
neutron
star
is
created
because
the
force
of
gravity
is
so
strong
that
the
atoms
left
behind
would
not
have
any
electrons
orbiting
the
nucleus
of
the
atoms


a
teaspoon
of
that
matter
might
weigh
as
much
as
the
entire
earth


a
much
bigger
red
giant
leaves
behind
a
black
hole


a
black
hole
is
created
because
gravity
is
so
strong
that
even
the
protons
and
neutrons
collapse
in
on
themselves


even
light
can
no
longer
escape
a
black
hole


since
there
is
nothing
we
know
of
stronger
than
the
force
that
holds
atomic
nuclei
the
plural
of
nucleus
together
some
physicists
think
that
a
black
hole
collapses
all
the
way
down
to
a
mathematical
point
called
a

genetics
is
a
discipline
of
biology


it
is
the
science
of
heredity


this
includes
the
study
of
genes
and
the
inheritance
of
variation
and
traits
of
living
organisms


in
the
laboratory
<collocation>genetics proceeds</collocation>
by
mating
carefully
selected
organisms
and
analyzing
their
offspring


more
informally
genetics
is
the
study
of
how
parents
pass
some
of
their
characteristics
to
their
children


it
is
an
important
part
of
biology
and
gives
the
basic
rules
on
which
evolution
acts


the
fact
that
living
things
inherit
traits
from
their
parents
has
been
known
since
prehistoric
times
and
used
to
improve
crop
plants
and
animals
through
selective
breeding


however
the
modern
science
of
genetics
which
seeks
to
understand
the
process
of
inheritance
only
began
with
the
work
of
gregor
mendel
in
the
century


although
he
did
not
know
the
physical
basis
for
heredity
mendel
observed
that
organisms
inherit
traits
via
discrete
units
of
inheritance
which
are
now
called
genes

known
as

every
cell
in
the

living

has
the

only
some
of
it
is
used
in
each

for
instance
some
genes
that
tell
how
to
make
parts
of
the
liver
are
switched
off
in
the

what
genes
are
used
can
also
change
over
time


for
instance
a
lot
of
genes
are
used
by
a
child
early
in
pregnancy
that
are
not

later


a
living
thing
has
two
copies
of
each
gene
one
from
its
mother
and
one
from
its
father


there
can
be
multiple
types
of
each
gene
which
give
different
instructions
one
version
might
cause
a
person
to
have
blue
eyes
another
might
cause
them
to
have
brown


these
different
versions
are
known
as
alleles
of
the
gene


since
a
living
thing
has
two
copies
of
each
gene
it
can
have
two
different
alleles
of
it
at
the
same
time


often
one
allele
will
be
dominant
meaning
that
the
living
thing
looks
and
acts
as
if
it
had
only
that
one
allele


the
unexpressed
allele
is
called
recessive


in
other
cases
you
end
up
with
something
in
between
the
two
possibilities


in
that
case
the
two

are
called


most
of
the
characteristics
that
you
can
see
in
a
living
thing

multiple
genes
that
influence
them


and
many
genes
have
multiple
effects
on
the
body
because
their
function
will
not
have
the

effect
in
each
tissue


the
multiple

of

the
whole
set
of

is
called
the

the
total
effect
of

on
the
body
is
called
the

these
are
key
terms
in
genetics


history
of
genetics
ideas
we
know
that
man
started
breeding
domestic
animals
from
early
times
probably
before
the
invention
of
agriculture


we
do
not
know
when
heredity
was
first
appreciated
as
a
scientific
problem


the
greeks
and
most
obviously
aristotle
studied
living
things
and
proposed
ideas
about
reproduction
and
heredity


probably
the
most
important
idea
before
mendel
was
that
of
charles
darwin
whose
idea
of
had
two
parts


the
first
that
persistent
hereditary
units
were
passed
on
from
one
generation
to
another
was
quite
right


the
second
was
his
idea
that
they
were
replenished
by
from
the
somatic
body
tissues


this
was
entirely
wrong
and
plays
no
part
in
science
today


darwin
was
right
about
one
thing
whatever
happens
in
evolution
must
happen
by
means
of
heredity
and
so
an
accurate
science
of
genetics
is
fundamental
to
the
theory
of
evolution


this
mating
between
genetics
and
evolution
took
many
years
to
organise


it
resulted
in
the
modern
<collocation>evolutionary synthesis</collocation>


mendelian
genetics
gregor
mendel
father
of
modern
genetics


the
basic
rules
of
genetics
were
first
discovered
by
a
monk
named
gregor
mendel
in
around


for
thousands
of
years
people
had
already
studied
how
traits
are
inherited
from
parents
to
their
children


however
mendel
work
was
different
because
he
designed
his
experiments
very
carefully


in
his
experiments
mendel
studied
how
traits
were
passed
on
in
<collocation>pea plants</collocation>


he
started
his
crosses
with
plants
that
bred
true
and
counted
characters
that
were
in
nature
either
tall
or
short


he
bred
large
numbers
of
plants
and
expressed
his
results
numerically


he
used
test
crosses
to
reveal
the
presence
and
proportion
of
recessive
characters


mendel
explained
the
results
of
his
experiment
using
two
scientific
laws


factors
later
called
genes
normally
occur
in
pairs
in
ordinary
body
cells
yet
separate
during
the
formation
of
sex
cells


these
factors
determine
the
organism
traits
and
are
inherited
from
its
parents


when
gametes
are
produced
by
meiosis
the
two
factors
separate


a
gamete
only
receives
one
or
the
other


this
mendel
called
the
law
of
segregation


alleles
of
different
genes
separate
independently
of
one
another
when
gametes
are
formed


this
he
called
the
law
of
independent
assortment


so
mendel
thought
that
different
traits
are
inherited
independently
of
one
another


we
now
know
this
is
only
true
if
the
genes
are
not
on
the
same
chromosome
in
which
case
they
are
not
linked
to
each
other


mendel
laws
helped
explain
the
results
he
observed
in
his
<collocation>pea plants</collocation>


later
geneticists
discovered
that
his
laws
were
also
true
for
other
living
things
even
humans


mendel
findings
from
his
work
on
the
<collocation>garden pea</collocation>
plants
helped
to
establish
the
field
of
genetics


his
contributions
were
not
limited
to
the
basic
rules
that
he
discovered


mendel
care
towards
controlling
experiment
conditions
along
with
his
attention
to
his
numerical
results
set
a
standard
for
future
experiments


over
the
years
scientists
have
changed
and
improved
mendel
ideas


however
the
science
of
genetics
would
not
be
possible
today
without
the
early
work
of
gregor
mendel


between
mendel
and
modern
genetics
in
the
years
between
mendel
work
and
the
foundations
of
the
study
of
cells
was
developed


the
facts
discovered
about
the
nucleus
and
cell
division
were
essential
for
mendel
work
to
be
properly
understood


the
first
to
observe
cell
division
in
a
<collocation>multicellular organism</collocation>


robert
a
jewish
polish
german
physiologist
was
the
first
person
to
state
the
foundation
of
cell
biology
that
cells
only
derive
from
other
cells


this
was
later
popularized
by
the
german
doctor
who
used
the
famous
phrase
e
meaning
all
cells
from
other
cells


gregor
mendel
paper
experiments
on
<collocation>plant hybridization</collocation>
was
published


meiosis
was
discovered
and
described
for
the
first
time
in
<collocation>sea urchin</collocation>
eggs
by
german
biologist
oscar


and
describe
chromosome
behavior
during
mitosis


meiosis
was
described
at
the
level
of
chromosomes
by
belgian
zoologist
van
in
eggs


german
zoologist
roux
realized
the
significance
of
the
linear
structure
of
chromosomes


their
splitting
into
two
equal
longitudinal
halves
assured
each
daughter
cell
got
the
same
chromosome
complement


therefore
chromosomes
were
the
bearers
of
heredity


dutch
botanist
hugo
de
suggests
that
inheritance
of
specific
traits
in
organisms
comes
in
particles
naming
such
particles
pan
genes


the
significance
of
meiosis
for
reproduction
and
inheritance
was
described
only
in
by
german
biologist
august
who
noted
that
two
cell
divisions
were
necessary
to
transform
one
cell
into
four
cells
if
the
number
of
chromosomes
had
to
be
maintained


a
german
biologist
in
a
series
of
papers
drew
attention
to
the
correspondence
between
the
behavior
of
chromosomes
and
the
results
obtained
by
mendel


he
said
that
chromosomes
were
independent
entities
which
retain
their
independence
even
in
the
resting
nucleus
what
comes
out
of
the
nucleus
is
what
goes
into
it


walter
suggested
that
chromosomes
which
segregate
in
a
<collocation>mendelian fashion</collocation>
are
hereditary
units


wilson
teacher
and
the
author
of
one
of
the
most
famous
in
biology
called
this
the
hypothesis


at
this
point
discoveries
in
merged
with
the
rediscovered
ideas
of
mendel
to
make
a
fusion
called
cell
genetics
heredity
which
has
continued
to
the
present
day


rediscovery
of
mendel
work
during
the
several
biologists
began
doing
experiments
on
breeding


and
soon
mendel
results
were
duplicated
even
before
his
papers
were
read


carl
and
hugo
de
were
the
main
of
mendel
writings
and
laws


both
acknowledged
mendel
priority
although
it
is
probable
that
de
did
not
understand
his
own
results
until
after
reading
mendel


though
von
was
originally
also
credited
with
rediscovery
this
is
no
longer
accepted
because
he
did
not
understand
mendel
laws


though
de
later
lost
interest
in
other
biologists
built
genetics
into
a
science


mendel
results
were
replicated
and
genetic
linkage
soon
worked
out


william
perhaps
did
the
most
in
the
early
days
to
publicise
mendel
theory


the
word
genetics
and
other
terminology
originated
with


mendel
experimental
results
have
later
been
the
object
of
some
debate


fisher
analyzed
the
results
of
the
second
filial
ratio
and
found
them
to
be
close
to
the
exact
ratio
of
to


it
is
sometimes
suggested
that
mendel
may
have
censored
his
results
and
that
his
seven
traits
each
occur
on
a
separate
chromosome
pair
an
extremely
unlikely
occurrence
if
they
were
chosen
at
random


in
fact
the
genes
mendel
studied
occurred
in
only
four
linkage
groups
and
only
one
gene
pair
out
of
possible
is
close
enough
to
show
deviation
from
independent
assortment
this
is
not
a
pair
that
mendel
studied


tools
of
<collocation>genetics mutations</collocation>

<collocation>gene duplication</collocation>
allows
diversification
by
providing
redundancy
one
gene
can
mutate
and
lose
its
original
function
without
harming
the
organism


during
the
process
of
replication
errors
sometimes
occur


these
errors
called
mutations
can
have
an
effect
on
the
phenotype
of
an
organism


in
turn
that
usually
has
an
effect
on
the
organism
fitness
its
ability
to
live
and
reproduce
successfully


error
rates
are
usually
very
low
error
in
every
million
bases
due
to
the
proofreading
ability
of


error
rates
are
a
thousandfold
higher
in
many
viruses


because
they
rely
on
and
which
lack
proofreading
ability
they
get
higher
<collocation>mutation rates</collocation>


processes
that
increase
the
rate
of
changes
in
are
called


chemicals
increase
errors
in
replication
often
by
interfering
with
the
structure
of

radiation
induces
mutations
by
causing
damage
to
the
structure


chemical
damage

occurs
naturally

to
repair
mismatches
and
breaks
in
nevertheless
the
repair
sometimes
fails
to
return
the
to
its
original
sequence


in
organisms
which
use
chromosomal
crossovers
to
exchange
and
recombine
genes
errors
in
alignment
during
meiosis
can
also
cause
mutations


errors
in
crossover
are
especially
likely
when
similar
sequences
cause
partner
chromosomes
to
adopt
a
mistaken
alignment
this
makes
some
regions
in
genomes
more
prone
to
mutating
in
this
way


these
errors
create
large
structural
changes
in

an
example
of
a
<collocation>pedigree chart</collocation>


geneticists
biologists
who
study
genetics
use
pedigree
charts
to
record
traits
of
people
in
a
family


using
these
charts
geneticists
can
study
how
a
trait
is
inherited
from
person
to
person


geneticists
can
also
use
pedigree
charts
to
predict
how
traits
will
be
passed
to
future
children
in
a
family


for
instance
genetic
counselors
are
professionals
who
work
with
families
who
might
be
affected
by
genetic
diseases


as
part
of
their
job
they
create
pedigree
charts
for
the
family
which
can
be
used
to
study
how
the
disease
might
be
inherited


twin
studies
since
human
beings
are
not
bred
experimentally
human
genetics
must
be
studied
by
other
means


one
recent
way
is
by
studying
the
<collocation>human genome</collocation>


another
way
older
by
many
years
is
to
study
twins


<collocation>identical twins</collocation>
are
<collocation>natural clones</collocation>


they
carry
the
same
genes
they
may
be
used
to
investigate
how
much
heredity
contributes
to
individual
people


studies
with
twins
have
been
quite
interesting


if
we
make
a
list
of
characteristic
traits
we
find
that
they
vary
in
how
much
they
owe
to
heredity


for
example
eye
color
entirely
inherited
weight
height
partly
inherited
partly
environmental
which
language
a
person
speaks
entirely
environmental


the
way
the
studies
are
done
is
like
this


take
a
group
of
<collocation>identical twins</collocation>
and
a
group
of
fraternal
twins


measure
them
for
various
traits


do
a
<collocation>statistical analysis</collocation>
such
as
analysis
of
variance


this
tells
you
to
what
extent
the
trait
is
inherited


those
traits
which
are
partly
inherited
will
be
significantly
more
similar
in
<collocation>identical twins</collocation>


studies
like
this
may
be
carried
further
by
comparing
<collocation>identical twins</collocation>
brought
up
together
with
<collocation>identical twins</collocation>
brought
up
in
different
circumstances


that
gives
a
handle
on
how
much
circumstances
can
alter
the
outcomes
of
genetically
identical
people


the
person
who
first
did
twin
studies
was
francis
darwin
who
was
a
founder
of
statistics


his
method
was
to
<collocation>trace twins</collocation>
through
their
making
many
kinds
of
measurement


unfortunately
though
he
knew
about
mono
and
twins
he
did
not
appreciate
the
real
genetic
difference


twin
studies
of
the
modern
kind
did
not
appear
until
the


genetics
of
and
viruses
the
genetics
of
bacteria
and
viruses
is
a
major
field
or
research


bacterial
mostly
divide
by
asexual
cell
division
but
do
have
a
kind
of
sex
by
horizontal
gene
transfer


bacterial
conjugation
and
transformation
are
their
methods


in
addition
the
complete
sequence
of
many
bacteria
and
viruses
is
now
known


although
many
bacteria
were
given
generic
and
specific
names
like
staphylococcus
aureus
the
whole
idea
of
a
species
is
rather
meaningless
for
an
organism
which
does
not
have
sexes
and
of
chromosomes


instead
these
organisms
have
strains
and
that
is
how
they
are
identified
in
the
laboratory


genes
and
development
<collocation>gene expression</collocation>
<collocation>gene expression</collocation>
is
the
process
by
which
the
information
in
a
gene
the
sequence
of
base
pairs
is
made
into
a
functional
gene
product
such
as
protein
or


the
basic
idea
is
that
is
transcribed
into
which
is
then
translated
into
proteins


proteins
make
many
of
the
structures
and
all
the
enzymes
in
a
cell
or
organism


several
steps
in
the
<collocation>gene expression</collocation>
process
may
be
modulated
tuned


this
includes
both
the
transcription
and
translation
stages
and
the
final
folded
state
of
a
protein


<collocation>gene regulation</collocation>
switches
genes
on
and
off
and
so
controls
cell
differentiation
and


<collocation>gene regulation</collocation>
may
also
serve
as
a
basis
for
evolutionary
change
control
of
the
timing
location
and
amount
of
<collocation>gene expression</collocation>
can
have
a
profound
effect
on
the
development
of
the
organism


the
expression
of
a
gene
may
vary
a
lot
in
different
tissues


this
is
called
a
<collocation>widespread phenomenon</collocation>
in
genetics


alternative
splicing
is
a
modern
discovery
of
great
importance


it
is
a
process
where
from
a
single
gene
a
large
number
of
variant
proteins
can
be
assembled


one
particular
drosophila
gene
can
be
alternatively
spliced
into
different


control
of
development
is
the
study
of
changes
in
gene
activity
which
are
not
caused
by
changes
in
the
sequence


it
is
the
study
of
<collocation>gene expression</collocation>
the
way
genes
bring
about
their
effects


these
changes
in
gene
activity
may
stay
for
the
remainder
of
the
cell
life
and
may
also
last
for
many
generations
of
cells
through
cell
divisions


however
there
is
no
change
in
the
underlying
sequence
of
the
organism


instead
factors
cause
the
organism
genes
to
behave
express
themselves
differently


genes
are
a
complex
of
genes
whose
<collocation>proteins bind</collocation>
to
the
regulatory
regions
of
target
genes


the
target
genes
then
activate
or
repress
cell
processes
to
direct
the
final
development
of
the
organism


inheritance
there
are
some
kinds
of
heredity
which
happen
outside
the
cell
nucleus


<collocation>normal inheritance</collocation>
is
from
both
parents
via
the
chromosomes
in
the
nucleus
of
a
egg
cell


there
are
some
kinds
of
inheritance
other
than
this


heredity
mitochondria
and
carry
some
of
their
own


their
is
decided
by
genes
in
the
chromosomes
and
genes
in
the


carl
discovered
an
example
in


the
four
plant
has
leaves
which
may
be
white
green
or
variegated


discovered
the
pollen
had
no
influence
on
this
inheritance


the
color
is
decided
by
genes
in
the


infectious
heredity
this
is
caused
by
a
symbiotic
or
<collocation>parasitic relationship</collocation>
with
a
microorganism


maternal
effect
in
this
case
nuclear
genes
in
the
<collocation>female gamete</collocation>
are
transcribed


the
products
accumulate
in
the
<collocation>egg cytoplasm</collocation>
and
have
an
effect
on
the
early
development
of
the
egg


the
coiling
of
a
snail
is
determined
like
this


shells
are
genotypes
dd
or
dd
while
shells
are
dd


the
most
important
example
of
maternal
effect
is
in
drosophila


the
protein
product
genes
activate
other
genes
which
in
turn
activate
still
more
genes

uses
a
