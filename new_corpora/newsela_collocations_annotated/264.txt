the
golden
legend
a
city
called
had
a
large
lake
where
a
dragon
who
breathed
fire
and
disease
lived


the
dragon
poisoned
all
the
countryside


to
please
the
dragon
the
people
of
gave
it
a
sheep
every
day
for
food
and
when
there
were
no
more
sheep
they
gave
their
children
to
the
dragon


the
children
were
chosen
by
a
lottery


one
year
the
lottery
chose
the
king
daughter


the
king
sad
and
desperate
asked
the
people
to
take
all
his
gold
and
silver
and
half
of
his
empire
but
only
if
his
daughter
could
be
saved


the
people
refused


the
daughter
was
sent
out
to
the
lake
dressed
in
white
as
a
bride
to
be
a
fine
meal
for
the
dragon


not
knowing
this
saint
george
was
riding
past
the
lake
on
the
same
day


the
princess
terrified
and
trembling
tried
to
send
him
away
but
george
said
he
would
stay
and
protect
her


the
dragon
came
suddenly
out
of
the
lake
while
they
were
speaking


saint
george
made
a
gesture
called
the
sign
of
the
cross
jumped
on
his
horse
and
advanced
toward
the
dragon


he
used
his
long
spear
to
hurt
the
dragon
badly


then
he
asked
the
princess
to
throw
her
long
pretty
belt
to
him


he
put
the
silk
belt
around
the
dragon
neck


now
the
dragon
followed
the
girl
like
a
<collocation>humble pet</collocation>
follows
its
master


the
princess
and
saint
george
took
the
dragon
back
to
the
city
of
where
the
people
were
terrified
to
see
the
dragon
enter


but
saint
george
told
them
not
to
be
scared


he
said
that
if
the
people
became
christians
and
went
to
church
to
be
baptized
he
would
kill
the
dragon
immediately


the
king
and
the
people
of
converted
to
christianity
george
killed
the
dragon
with
his
sword
and
its
body
was
taken
out
of
the
city
on
carts


fifteen
thousand
men
were
baptized
not
counting
women
and
children


on
the
site
where
the
dragon
died
the
king
built
a
church
for
the
blessed
virgin
mary
and
saint
george


from
the
altar
in
the
church
came
a
fountain
of
holy
water


the
water
cured
any
disease


symbolism
the
story
of
saint
george
and
the
dragon

over
evil
and
is
very

of
a
lot
of
art
through
many
centuries


in

the
princess
symbolizes
the
nation
of
sweden
and
the
dragon
represents
a
foreign
army

saint
patrick
bell
there
is
a
bell
in
the
national
museum
of
ireland
that
was
made
around
the
time
of
saint
patrick
life


there
is
no
evidence
that
saint
patrick
owned
the
bell
but
the
irish
have
believed
the
bell
belonged
to
saint
patrick
for
years


one
of
the
kings
of
ulster
who
was
the
high
king
of
ireland
at
the
time
had
a
beautiful
cover
made
out
of
gold
and
gems
to
preserve
the
bell


the
names
of
the
bishops
of
ireland
were
engraved
on
the
cover


the
style
of
the
letters
on
the
cover
were
used
to
make
the
first
typewriters


it
is
believed
that
the
bell
was
rung
by
saint
patrick
to
let
people
know
it
was
time
for
church


saint
patrick
and
the
snakes
there
are
no
snakes
in
ireland
but
there
is
a
legend
that
at
the
time
of
saint
patrick
there
were
lots
of
snakes
and
he
chased
them
all
into
the
irish
sea


some
say
that
this
legend
came
to
be
because
pagans
had
tattoos
of
snakes
and
saint
patrick
got
rid
of
the
pagans
by
teaching
christianity
and
therefore
drove
out
the
snakes
from
ireland


holy
