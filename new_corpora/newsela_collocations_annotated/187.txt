history
the
name
broken
link
organic
organic
is
a
historical
name
from
the
century


people
believed
that
only
living
things
could
make
organic
compounds
and
dead
things
such
as
minerals
could
make
inorganic
compounds


however
proved
this
wrong
because
certain
compounds
in
urine
were
thought
to
be
inorganic
but
urine
came
from
a
living
thing


another
kind
of
model
of
a
different
compound
kinds
of
organic
compounds
there
are
natural
organic
compounds
and
synthetic
ones


their
structure
may
be
described
by
using
names
and
making
diagrams


one
way
of
showing
the
molecule
is
by
drawing
its
structural
formula


because
molecules
can
have
complicated
structures
people
have
made
ways
to
show
them
in
simple
language


one
way
is
to
use
line
diagrams


each
atom
is
shown
by
a
letter
and
connected
by
a
line
to
each
atom
with
which
it
is
has
a
<collocation>covalent bond</collocation>


one
line
means
a
single
bond
two
lines
means
a
double
bond
and
so
on


because
there
is
in
an
infinite
number
of
possible
organic
compounds
language
is
needed
to
give
a
unique
name
to
each
one


the
international
union
of
pure
and
applied
chemistry
or
made
a
system
for
doing
this


although
an
name
makes
every
single
possible
molecule
unique
the
names
are
often
long
and
complicated
so
in
everyday
life
<collocation>trivial names</collocation>
unofficial
but
widely
understood
names
are
used
such
as
the
<collocation>trivial names</collocation>
and
acetaminophen
which
are
used
for
a
compound
whose
name
is
n


some
of
these
<collocation>trivial names</collocation>
are
trademarks


<collocation>natural compounds</collocation>
<collocation>natural compounds</collocation>
are
compounds
made
by
plants
or
animals


these
could
also
be
made
in
a
lab
but
many
of
these
compounds
are
taken
from
nature
because
it
is
easier
and
less
expensive
to
do
it
that
way


compounds
are
amino
acids
proteins
carbohydrates
many
antibiotics
like
penicillin
and


<collocation>synthetic compounds</collocation>
<collocation>synthetic compounds</collocation>
are
those
made
by
people


sometimes
this
is
done
by
taking
something
natural
and
changing
the
molecule
in
a
small
way
such
as
making
glycerine
from
<collocation>vegetable oils</collocation>


other
compounds
are
synthesized
in
long
complicated
reactions
with
many
steps


plastics
are
sometimes
mostly
natural
and
other
kinds
are
manufactured


structure
since
a
compound
is
often
first
discovered
in
nature
instead
of
being
made
on
purpose
in
a
lab
people
may
know
the
compound
exists
and
even
know
what
it
does
sometimes
but
not
know
exactly
what
atoms
it
is
made
of
and
how
it
is
arranged


there
are
several
ways
of
taking
an
unknown
compound
and
finding
out

natural

is
burned

history

from
the
department
of
energy


energy
is
a
word
with
more
than
one
meaning


energy
means
something
has
the
ability
to
cause
change


mostly
it
is
used
in
science
to
describe
how
much
potential
a
physical
system
has
to
change


it
may
also
be
used
in
economics
to
describe
the
part
of
the
market
where
energy
itself
is
harnessed
and
sold
to
consumers


it
can
sometimes
refer
to
the

conservation

energy
can

the

a

can
be

a

as
in
other

there

the

for
measuring

are
used
to

some

units
of

for
energy
the
si

joule
is

the
energy
unit
of

for

the

the
<collocation>precious stones</collocation>
is
an
old
book
from
the
that
is
considered
one
of
the
most
important
books
about
<collocation>precious stones</collocation>


it
is
written
in
the
arabic
language


xenon
in
shaped
tubes


xenon
is
a
<collocation>chemical element</collocation>


it
has
the
chemical
symbol
and
atomic
number


it
is
one
of
the
few
elements
that
are
a
gas
at
<collocation>standard temperature</collocation>
and
pressure


sir
william
and
discovered
this
element
in


the
element
name
came
from
the
greek
word
which
means
stranger


xenon
is
a
belongs
to
the
group
of
the
<collocation>noble gases</collocation>


<collocation>noble gases</collocation>
are
very


however
in
chemists
have
found
that
xenon
can
react
with
fluorine
under
special
conditions


those
special
conditions
are
high
pressure
and
high
temperature


it
is
not
known
why
xenon
behaves
differently
under
these
circumstances


there
are
also
some
compounds
with
oxygen


the
gas
is
not
very
reactive
because
if
fulfills
the
<collocation>octet rule</collocation>


this
means
that
a
lot
of
energy
is
needed
to
remove
an
electron
from
xenon


this
activation
energy
for
xenon
is
mol


to
remove
a
second
electron
from
xenon
an
energy
of
is
needed


known
oxidation
states
of
xenon
are
and


however
the
most
stable
form
is
pure
xenon
or
the
xenon
oxidation
state
of


xenon
has
stable
isotopes
and
more
than
unstable
isotopes


xenon

is
used
in
