from

in

a

is
a
large

can

of
food
after
it
has
been
chewed


it
passes
down
the
oesophagus
by
peristalsis


oesophagus
in
the
gastrointestinal
system
<collocation>digestive system</collocation>
the
oesophagus
also
spelled
esophagus
also
called
the
gullet
is
the
part
of
the
gastrointestinal
system
between
the
mouth
and
the
stomach


it
connects
the
and
the
stomach


it
is
about
convert
cm
long


the
oesophagus
is
lined
with
muscle


this
muscle
pushes
food
down
into
the
stomach


the
oesophagus
can
contract
or
expand
to
allow
for
the
passage
of
food


the
<collocation>muscular movement</collocation>
that
pushes
the
food
down
the
oesophagus
is
called
peristalsis


at
the
entrance
to
the
stomach
there
is
a
ring
of
muscle
called
a
sphincter


this
is
usually
closed
but
relaxes
as
food
approaches
allowing
it
to
enter
the
stomach


in
the
stomach
the
food
is
churned
until
it
turns
into
a
soupy
mixture
called


a
protease
is
a
<collocation>digestive enzyme</collocation>

dental
floss
dental
floss
is
a
special
type
of
thread


it
is
used
for
cleaning
spaces
between
teeth
which
can
not
be
reached
by
toothbrushes


it
is
important
to
floss
before
<collocation>brushing teeth</collocation>
and
to
floss
at
least
once
a
day


tooth
brushing
will
not
clean
food
that
is
packed
between
teeth


this
food
packing
can
lead
to
unhealthy
teeth
and
gums


bacteria
grow
in
this
packed
food
between
teeth


these
bacteria
cause
the
surface
of
teeth
enamel
to
break
down


then
the
teeth
and
gums
and
sometimes
even
the
jaw
can
become
seriously
diseased


these
bacteria
that
come
from
the
food
on
the
teeth
and
between
the
teeth
are
called
plaque
or
<collocation>bacterial plaque</collocation>
and
also
can
cause
the
gums
to
become
less
healthy


gingivitis
which
means
gum
disease
is
one
type
of
disease
that
flossing
helps
to
prevent


very
serious
diseases
can
start
on
the
teeth
and
move
to
the
bone
of
the
jaw
damaging
the
jaw
badly


flossing
your
teeth
reduces
the
danger
of
these
serious
diseases
of
the
jaw
bone


these
jaw
bone
diseases
are
called
<collocation>periodontal disease</collocation>


food
that
is
trapped
between
the
teeth
can
be
uncomfortable
and
even
cause
pain


some
food
is
hard
for
example
meat
apple


ground
meat
is
soft
and
so
is
<collocation>apple sauce</collocation>


chicken
and
turkey
meat
are
hard
and
full
of
fibers
and
very
often
get
trapped
between
the
teeth


when
hard
food
is
trapped
between
the
teeth
it
can
<collocation>cause discomfort</collocation>
and
sometimes
pain


when
hard
food
is
pressed
by
the
teeth
against
the
gum
it
can
cause
pain


some
people
use
toothpicks
to
try
to
remove
trapped
food
from
between
the
teeth
and
other
people
use
dental
floss
to
do
this


dental
floss
can
do
most
things
that
a
toothpick
can
do
but
dental
floss
is
<collocation>much thinner</collocation>
than
a
toothpick
and
can
thus
get
to
places
that
most
toothpicks
can
not
reach


so
floss
presumably
does
a
better
job
at
getting
bits
of
food
out
from
between
the
teeth
relieving
discomfort
and
<collocation>pain quicker</collocation>


when
a
person
first
starts
flossing
bleeding
can
happen


this
is
normal
and
happens
because
teeth
and
gums
that
are
not
flossed
are
less
healthy


it
will
stop
as
the
teeth
and
gums
get
healthier
with
flossing


rickets
is
a
disease
in
young
children


it
is
caused
by
deficiency
of
vitamin
d
and
calcium


rickets
causes
larger
gaps
inside
bones
and
turns
them
dry
and
spongy


it
also
makes
a
curve
on
the
legs


the
word
rickets
comes
from
the
greek
word
which
means
spine


people
can
get
rickets
if
they
have

is
an

used


biologists
prefer

however
this

is
full
of

the

variegated

of

a
variegated
leaf
is
a
leaf
which
contains

parts


as
the
green
parts
contain
chlorophyll
they
can
but
the
non

parts
do
not
contain
chlorophyll
so
they
can
not


uses
a
variegated
leaf
is
useful
in
conducting
experiments
that
can
show
that
chlorophyll
is
needed
for

to
happen


they
are
also
popular
in
horticulture


experiments
the
easiest
of
these
experiments
is
to
place
the
leaf
in
boiling
water
for
five
minutes
to
soften
the
cells
and
help
the
iodine
soak
in
and
then
in

alcohol
and
when
drained
of
color
spread
out
on

surface


soak
the
leaf
in
iodine
and
the
green
parts
will
turn
and
the
non
green
parts
will
stay
the
brown
color
of

liquid


the
green

contain

is
a
song
written
by
joseph
haydn
and
von


part
of
this
song
is
the
national

of
germany
german
national
anthem


a
line
from
this
song
unity
and
justice
and
liberty
is
the
motto
of
germany


history
the
music
was
written
by
haydn
in
as
the
anthem
of
austria


it
was
called
franz
den
kaiser
god
protect
our
emperor

the
words
which
are
used
today
were
written
by
the

august

the
first
line
germany
germany
above
all
sounds
too
strong
for
some
people
and
is
often
misunderstood


wanted
a
united
germany
when
he
wrote
it


at
that
time
germany
was
not
one
country
but
many
small
countries


so
germany
above
all
meant
that
the
most
important
thing
to
do
was
to
have
a
unified
germany


also
the
poet
was
in
where
people
spoke
german
but
were
ruled
by
the
british


music
was
very
popular
in
germany
during
the
second
part
of
the
century


this
song
was
not
a
national
anthem
then
but
a
song
for
people
who
loved
the
idea
of
a
strong
and
united
germany


in
it
replaced

at
that
time


it
was
not
sung
very
often


during
the
time
of
hitler
only
the
first
part
of
the
song
was
used


this
was
often
followed
by
a
nazi
party
song


this
part
of
the
song
was
difficult
for
some
people
who
were
not
germans
because
it
has
words
describing
germany
as
a
country
that
included
land
that
was
in
other
countries


after
the
second
<collocation>world war</collocation>
germany
was
divided
into
two
countries


in
the
new
western
germany
tried
to
get
a
new
song
for
the
national
anthem


another
song
was
chosen
written
by
poet
alexander


it
was
not
very
popular


finally
the
third
part
of
the
song
was
made
into
the
national
anthem


in
the
other
part
of
germany
the
eastern
germany
the
words
of
poet
johannes
from

were
used
with
a

was

were
not
sung
because
of
the

germany
our

after
east
and
west
germany
united
again
in
the
song
again
became
the
national
anthem
of
germany
but
only
the
third
part
is
used
