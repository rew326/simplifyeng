coffee
types
there
are
two
main
types
of
coffee
plant


the
the
most
common


most
of
the
world
coffee
is
made
from
beans
and
the
which
is
easier
to
grow
in
places
where
will
not
grow


is
cheaper
and
has
more
caffeine
than
and
it
is
used
in
many
commercial
coffee
products


but
tastes
bitter
and
acidic
so
people
only
drink
it
with
other
things


better
quality
are
in
some
espresso
blends


in
the
past
people
gave
names
to
new
coffees
from
the
port
they
came
from


the
two
oldest
coffees
are
mocha
and
java


today
names
are
more
specific


they
tell
us
the
country
region
and
sometimes
even
the
property
where
they
come
from


preparing
coffee
coffee
fruit
beans
coffee
beans
before
roasting
coffee
beans
after
roasting
aging
some
sorts
of
coffee
taste
better
if
the
beans
are
aged


this
means
that
after
they
are
picked
the
beans
are
dried
and
then
kept
from
three
to
eight
years


this
aging
gives
the
coffee
a
less
acidic
taste


coffee
that
has
been
aged
is
often
mixed
or
blended
with
other
coffee
that
is
not
aged


roasting
roasting
is
one
of
the
important
stages
in
making
coffee
beans
into
coffee


when
a
coffee
bean
is
roasted
it
grows
nearly
two
times
bigger
and
changes
from
green
to
yellow
to
brown


the
length
of
time
that
the
coffee
beans
are
roasted
makes
the
coffee
taste
different


some
types
of
coffee
such
as
mocha
and
java
are
roasted
for
a
short
time


it
is
easy
to
tell
from
the
flavor
where
the
coffee
is
from


when
coffee
is
roasted
for
a
long
time
it
is
harder
to
tell
the
different
types
apart


green
coffee
beans
can
be
bought
and
roasted
at
home
in
the
oven


grinding
before
the
coffee
is
made
into
a
drink
it
is
ground
in
a
small
grinding
machine
called
a
<collocation>coffee mill</collocation>


the
<collocation>coffee mill</collocation>
breaks
the
beans
into
very
small
pieces


coffee
is
turned
into
a
drink
in
several
different
ways


for
some
ways
of
making
coffee
such
as
espresso
it
is
best
to
have
the
coffee
ground
into
<collocation>fine powder</collocation>
but
for
other
types
of
such
as
filtered
coffee
the
coffee
is
in
larger
pieces
to
stop
it
going
through
the
filter


finely
ground
coffee
makes
a
stronger
taste


<collocation>brewing coffee</collocation>
is
made
into
a
drink
by
putting
the
coffee
into
boiling
water


this
is
called
brewing
coffee


there
are
many
ways
to
<collocation>brew coffee</collocation>


four
of
the
most

are

the

and
the

some
studies
have
looked
at
the
<collocation>health risks</collocation>
of
coffee


in
february
there
was
a
study
in
denmark
of
women
to
find
out
if
coffee
had
an
effect
on
pregnancy
and
birth


it
was
found
that
if
a
woman
drank
between
four
and
seven
cups
of
coffee
a
day
it
did
not
seem
to
make
a
big
change
to
the
number
of
babies
that
were
born
dead
stillborn


but
the
women
in
the
study
who
drank
eight
or
more
cups
of
coffee
a
day
had
three
times
as
much
chance
of
having
a
stillborn
baby


for
this
and
other
reasons
some
people
drink
coffee
substitutes
instead

in

they
had
a

now
there
are
two

with

four

it
is
the
family
in

one
of

cats

so
although
related
to
felines
and
in
their

style
they
are
similar
to
canines


<collocation>convergent evolution</collocation>
has
taken
place


both
and
canines
are
non

running
hunters
which
catch
prey
with
their
teeth
rather
than
claws


both
eat
food
quickly
and
may
store
it
and
their
calloused
feet
with
large
blunt
nails
are
adapted
for
running
and
making
sharp
turns
