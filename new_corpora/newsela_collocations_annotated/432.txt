an
evil
goddess
from
a
different
dimension


she
was
trapped
in
the
body
of
a
baby
boy
named
ben


many
years
later
she
began
to
take
control
of
the
body


after
a
while
she
could
take
full
control
and
change
the
body
into
that
of
her
own
form
for
a
short
time


glory
was
trying
to
find
the
key
that
would
let
her
go
back
to
her
own
dimension


buffy
stopped
her


she
beat
her
very
badly

glory
was
trapped
inside

that
she
would
become
strong
enough

glory
was
the
main
villain
of
season

the
creator
of

no

an
army

very
very
old
vampires
called

a
cult
of
humans
called
the

that
did
things
for

because
it
could
not
do
them
itself


the

its
plans
were
stopped

the
main
villain
in
season


trademarks
joss
uses
several
themes
throughout
his
works


these
are
often
found
in
the
writing
done
for
buffy


strong
female
characters
as
a
supporter
of
feminism
likes
to
create
<collocation>teenage girls</collocation>
with
superpowers


many
of
the
most
powerful
characters
in

are
female


buffy
and

examples

and
for
minor
parts
larry
and

hope


witty
dialogue
the
dialogue
in
joss
series
and
movies
is
notable


it
often
has
wit
and
pop
culture
references


some
are
easy
to
notice
others
are
more
difficult


death
no
one
is
safe
in
a
story
written
by


major
characters
can
die
at
any
time


minor
characters
die
more
often


in
a

not
all
deaths
are
forever
though


buffy
herself
died
at
least
four
times
and
was
brought
back
to
life
twice


tara
jenny
calender
<collocation>joyce summers</collocation>

did
not
return


other
characters
such
as
harmony
died
and
came
back
as
vampires


relationships
a
good
<collocation>romantic relationship</collocation>
makes
for
a
bad
story


does
not
like
relationships
that
have
a
happy

every
relationship
in
the
series
ended
badly


angel

in

badly


buffy
father
left

the
vampire
by
philip
vampires
are
monsters
in
legends
and
stories


the
first
vampire
stories
were
told
in
eastern
europe
but
much
of
how
modern
people
see
vampires
was
created
by
stoker
in
the
famous
novel


few
people
believe
that
vampires
are
real
but
they
are
still
very
popular
in
movies
television
and
books


vampires
were
once
people
but
have
a
<collocation>supernatural curse</collocation>


some
vampires
must
drink
blood
to
survive


they
do
this
by
biting
people
or
animals
on
the
neck
with
their
two
long
fangs


people
who
are
killed
by
having
their
blood
drank
by
vampires
may
also
become
vampires


others
can
live
off
the
life
energy
of
people


in
many
stories
vampires
can
change
into
other
animals
usually
bats
though
also
wolves
cats
or
rats


depending
on
the
story
vampires
may
have
some
or
all
of
these
characteristics
they
can
not
go
out
in
sunlight
so
they
sleep
during
the
day


they
can
only
be
killed
in
certain
ways
being
beheaded
having
a
stake
driven
through
their
heart
being
set
on
fire
they
can
be
weakened
by
crosses
or
other
religious
symbols
garlic
holy
water
and
silver


they
can
not
cross
the
ocean
unless
they
are
in
a
coffin
surrounded
by
soil
from
their
homeland


they
can
not
enter
a
house
unless
they
have
been
invited
in


if
a
bag
of
rice
grain
seeds
or
other
similar
substance
is
spilled
on
the
ground
a
vampire
will
have
to
count
every
grain


they
have
no
reflection
in
glass
mirrors
or
other
things

vampires
in
fiction
a
vampire
is
the
most
famous
vampire
in
fiction
and
many
movies
have
been
made
about
him
often
with
christopher
lee
as
himself


bela
is
another
actor
known
for
the
role


is
also
a
famous
vampire
movie


there
is
a
popular
series
of
books
by
anne
rice
about
vampires


stephen
king
also
wrote
about
vampires
in
the
in
salem
lot


the
television
show
buffy
the
vampire
slayer
featured
a
young
girl
who
fought
vampires
but
also
befriended
good
ones


the
series
twilight
by
is
also
about
vampires


the
movie
the
lost
boys
was
about
a
band
of
vampires
in
then
modern
california


among
many
other
stories
about
vampires
are
the
southern
vampire
mysteries
which
led
to
the
show
true
blood


protection
in
stories
garlic
is
often
used
for
keeping
vampires
away


a
branch
of
wild
rose
or
hawthorn
are
said
fact
date
september
to
hurt
vampires
and
in
europe
putting
mustard
seeds
on
the
roof
of
a
house
was
said
to
keep
them
away


though
this
is
not
traditional
mirrors
have
been
used
to
make
vampires
stay
away
in
some
cultures
vampires
do
not
have
a
reflection
and
sometimes
do
not
have
a
shadow
perhaps
as
a
way
of
showing
that
they
do
not
have
souls


not
all
vampires
in
stories
have
this
quality
the
greek
had
both
reflections
and
shadows
was
used
by
stoker
in


other
some
neurologists
believe
that
rabies
might
lie
at
the
base
of
the
myth


rabid
people
have
trouble
walking


they
are
sexually
very
active
and
can
be
aggressive


they
may
bite
while
they
are
in
this
frenzy


very
often
they
have
cramps
or
seizures


they
do
bite
their
tongue
often
during
such
cramps


this
may
lead
to
them
bleeding
from
their
mouth


rabies
can
be
spread
by
biting
many
diseases
of
the
brain
make
people
sensitive
to
light


many
diseases
of
the
brain
make
people
have
difficulty
swallowing


this
is
the
fear
of
water


the
problem
with
this
is
that
rabid
people
especially
in
advanced
stages
of
the
disease
will
live
for
about
ten
days
at
best


this
does
not
account
for
them
getting
out
of
ditches
and
graves
over
weeks
or
months


another
explanation
was
given
by
other
people


the
disease
might
be
porphyria
rather
than
rabies


porphyria
is
a
genetic
condition
that
leads
to
differences
when
the
body
makes
blood


some
parts
of
the
blood
can
not
be
made
in
sufficient
quantities


psychological
disorders
can
contribute
to
vampiric
behavior


as
well
as
the
fact
that
drinking
blood
has
always
been
believed
to
give
you
the
strength
of
the
one
you
drink
from


that
belief
stems
all
the
way
back
to
ancient
civilizations


there
are
people
in
the
real
world
who
like
to
dress
and
behave
like
a
vampire


some
of
them
may
also
drink
blood

they
are
given

the
college
courses
needed

already
attended
the
<collocation>undergraduate courses</collocation>


the
reason
the
courses
are
so
difficult
so
hard
to

is
that
they
assume
the
person
already
knows
perhaps
technical
terms
learned
in
earlier
college
courses


this
is
similar
to
having
to
know
the
latin

technical
