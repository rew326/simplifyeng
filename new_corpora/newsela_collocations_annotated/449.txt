the
prince
is
a
book
written
by
who
lived
in
the
city
of
florence
in
the
country
of
italy


the
book
was
published
in


the
book
talks
about
politics
and
government


during
his
life
saw
many
changes
in
the
government
of
florence


he
thought
a
lot
about
what
a
king
or
prince
should
do
to
make
a
strong
government


in
the
book
he
said
the
ruler
had
to
get
a
lot
of
power


one
of
the
things
he
said
that
made
people
worried
was
that
ethics
and
politics
are
different


a
person
might
have
to
do
things
that
are
wrong
to
get
power
but
with
power
he
could
then
do
good
things


this
thought
made
people
upset


some
people
think
that
was
being
honest
with
his
advice
and
saying
what
he
really
thought


other
people
think
that
was
playing
a
joke
on
princes
who
wanted
too
much
power
and
did
not
care
about
what
was
