very
often
one
volume
one
book
will
translate
both
ways
so
half
the
book
will
be
translating
from

and
the
other
half
from
dutch
to
english


when
using
a
dictionary
to
find
out
how
to
say
something
in
another
language
one
has
to
be
careful
to
choose
the
right
word


a
word
like
right
has
two
basic
meanings
in
english
correct
and
the
opposite
of
left


other
languages
are
not
like
english
they
will
have
different
words
for
these
different
meanings


a
word
like
put
has
many
meanings


a
good
dictionary
will
have
a
large
list
of
these
meanings
to
help
people
find
the
word
they
want


in
many
languages
for
example
the
word
put
will
be
different
according
to
whether
something
is
being
put
onto
something
a
table
or
into
something
a
cupboard


updating
<collocation>dictionaries dictionaries</collocation>
need
to
be
updated
frequently
because
of
the
way
language
changes


new
words
are
often
brought
into
a
language
lots
of
computer
terms
or
words
change
their
meanings
gay
or
cool


the
