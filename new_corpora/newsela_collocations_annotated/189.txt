the
word
body
is
sometimes
used
in
other
ways


for
example
a
lake
is
a
body
of
water


a
rope
made
from
steel
alloy
steel
alloy
is
made
from
iron
and
carbon


an
alloy
is
a
uniform
mixture


it
is
made
up
of
two
or
more
chemical
elements
of
which
at
least
one
is
a
metal


an
alloy
has
properties
different
from
the
metals
it
is
made
of


most
alloys
are
made
by
melting
the
metals
mixing
them
while
they
are
liquid
to
form
a
solution
then
leaving
them
to
cool
and
turn
solid
again


theory
combining
a
pure
metal
with
one
or
more
other
metals
or
often
makes
it
better


for
example
steel
is
an
alloy
made
from
iron
but
it
is
stronger
than
iron


physical
property
properties
like
density
and
electrical
and
thermal
heat
conductivity
may
not
be
much
different
than
the
elements
substances
which
make
the
alloy


but
properties
like
strength
can
be
very
much
different


the
first
alloy
to
be
discovered
was
bronze


bronze
is
made
from
copper
and
tin


bronze
was
discovered
a
very
long
time
ago
in
the
prehistoric
period


then
bronze
was
being
used
for
making
tools
and
weapons


this
period
was
known
as
<collocation>bronze age</collocation>


but
later
better
alloys
were
discovered
which
replaced
bronze
for
making
tools
and
weapons


now
bronze
is
used
for
making
ornaments
statues
and
bells


brass
is
another
alloy
made
from
copper
and
zinc


melting
point
is
the
temperature
at
which
a
solid
changes
to
liquid


most
alloys
do
not
have
a
single
melting
point


they
have
a
melting
range
in
which
the
alloy
is
a
mixture
of
solid
and
liquid
stages


the
temperature
at
which
melting
just
starts
is
called
and
the
temperature
at
which
the
melting
is
just
finished
is
called


terms
related
to
alloys
the
term
alloy
means
a
mixture
of
atoms
in
which
the
main
substance
or
the
<collocation>primary constituent</collocation>
is
a
metal


this
primary
metal
is
called
the
base
or
matrix


if
an
alloy
has
only
two
types
of
atoms
like
alloy
then
such
an
alloy
is
called
binary
alloy


if
an
alloy
has
three
types
of
atoms
like
iron
nickel
and
chromium
then
it
is
called
a
alloy


an
alloy
with
four
types
of
atoms
is
called
a
quaternary
alloy
and
an
alloy
with
five
types
of
atoms
is
called
a
alloy


different
varieties
or
forms
of
alloys
can
be
made
from
the
same
constituent
materials
substances
from
which
the
alloy
is
formed


these
different
forms
or
varieties
can
be
formed
by
using
different
amounts
of
the
constituents


the
whole
range
of
possible
varieties
of
an
alloy
is
called
a
system


all
the
forms
of
alloy
having
only
two
constituents
are
called
a
binary
system


all
forms
of
an
alloy
having
three
constituents
are
called

the

does

for

the
brain
also
controls
<collocation>basic autonomic</collocation>

actions
like

heartbeat
that
happen
automatically


these
activities
and
much
else
are
governed
by
<collocation>unconscious functions</collocation>
of
the
brain
and
nervous
system


all
the
information
about
the
world
gathered
by
our
senses
is
sent
through
nerves
into
the
brain
allowing
us
to
see
hear
smell
taste
and
feel
things


the
brain
processes
this
information
and
we
experience
it
as
pictures
sounds
and
so
on


the
brain
also
uses
nerves
to
tell
the
body
what
to
do
for
example
by
telling
muscles
to
move
or
our
heart
to
beat
faster


all
vertebrates
have
brains
and
over
time
their
brains
have
evolved
to
become
more
complex


some
simple
animals
however
like
sponges
do
not
have
anything
like
a

segmented
invertebrates
have
in
each
segment
and
a
ring
of

this
acts
to
bring
sense
data
from
the
front
into
play
with
the
movement
of
the
body


parts
in
mammals
the
brain
is
made
of
three
main
parts
the
cerebrum
the
cerebellum
and
the
brainstem


the
surface
of
the
cerebrum
is
the
cerebral
cortex
which
all
vertebrates
have


mammals
also
have
an
extra
layer
the
neocortex


this
is
the
key
to
the
behavior
which
is
typical
of
mammals
especially
humans


cerebral
cortex
the
cortex
has
sensory
motor
and
association
areas


the
sensory
areas
are
the
areas
that
receive
and
process
information
from
the
senses


the
motor
areas
control
<collocation>voluntary movements</collocation>
especially
fine
movements
performed
by
the
hand


the
right
half
of
the
motor
area
controls
the
left
side
of
the
body
and
vice
versa


association
areas
produce
a
<collocation>meaningful experience</collocation>
of
the
world
and
supports
abstract
thinking
and
language


this
enables
us
to
interact
effectively


most
connections
are
from
one
area
of
the
cortex
to
another
rather
than
to
<collocation>subcortical areas</collocation>
the
figure
may
be
as
high
as


cerebellum
the
cerebellum
coordinates
muscles
so
they
work
together


it
is
also
the
center
of
balance
a
vital
part
of
movement


<collocation>brain stem</collocation>
the
<collocation>brain stem</collocation>
is
at
the
back
of
the
brain
actually
underneath
it
in
humans


it
joins
the
rest
of
the
brain
with
the
spinal
cord


it
has
lots
of
different
parts
that
control
different
jobs
in
the
body
for
instance
the
<collocation>brain stem</collocation>
controls
breathing
heartbeat
sneezing
eye
blinking
and
swallowing


body
temperature
and
hunger
are
also
controlled
by
parts
of
the
<collocation>brain stem</collocation>


size
the
volume
of
the
human
brain
relative
to
the
size
of
the
whole
body
is
very
large
compared
to
that
of
most
other
animals


the
human
brain
also
has
a
very
large
surface
called
cortex
for
its
size
which
is
possible
because
it
is
very
wrinkled


if
the
human
cortex
were
flattened
it
would
be
close
to
a
square
meter
in
area


some
other
animals
also
have
very
wrinkled
brains
such
as
dolphins
and
elephants


here
is
a
rule
of
thumb
the
larger
an
animal
is
the
larger
its
brain
will
be


even
allowing
for
that
the
human
brain
and
in
particular
the
neocortex
is
very
large


we
know
it
increased
in
size
over
the
last
several
million
years
of
evolution


there
are
ideas
about
why
this
happened
but
is
quite
sure


most
theories
suggest
complex
social
activity
and
the
evolution
of
language
would
make
a
larger
brain
advantageous


as
an
additional
note
einstein
brain
weighed
only
grams
which
is
less
than
the
average
adult
male

the

obviously
matters

in
ways
which
are
not
understood
at
present


cells
a
human
brain
accounts
for
about
of
the

weight
but
it
uses
about

about

nerve
cells
also

if
a
line
has
a
point
named
a
on
the
line
and
a
point
named
b
on
the

then
the
