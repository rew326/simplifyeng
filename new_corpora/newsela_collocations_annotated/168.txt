controlled

course

on
a
course
two
rounds
make
up
a
normal
game


each
hole
starts
from
the
teeing
area


golfers
put
the
ball
on
a
small
stand
called
a
tee
and
swing
a
club
at
it
to
try
and
hit
it
as
straight
and
far
as
possible


once
each
golfer
in
the
group
has
done
this
the

hits
his

followed
by

else
one
person

everyone
is

the
green
is
the
area
near

the
grass
is
cut
very
short


once
on
the
green
the
players
will
try
to
put
the
ball
into

hole


putting
is
similar
to
a
regular
swing
except
it
is
not
as
hard
and
the
player
does
not
want
the
ball
to
go
in
the
air


once
each
player
has
put
their
ball
into
the
hole
the
group
moves
on
to
the
next
hole


each
time
a
player
swings
at
his
ball
it
is
considered
a
stroke


each
hole
is
a
certain
number
of
strokes
that
golfers
are
expected
to
need
to
get
their
ball
into
the
hole


this
is
known
as
the
par


if
a
player
shoots
his
ball
in

the

gets
a

if

varying
distances

spirituality
is
a
name
given
to
matters
of
the
spirit


some
people
use
this
word
instead
of
religion
while
others
see
a
difference


matters
of
the
spirit
matters
of
the
spirit
may
include
the
meaning
in
a
person
life
or
in
all
life
and
how
to
find
and
improve
on
it


they
may
also
include
someone
search
for
god
the
supernatural
a
divine
influence
in
their
lives
or
information
about
the
afterlife
and
how
to
best
deal
with
each


matters
of
the
spirit
may
also
include
how
to
live
among
others
as
a
group
or
in
a
certain
environment


spiritual
but
not
religious
some
who
do
not
believe
in
an
organized
religion
may
still
be
interested
in
the
spirits
of
humanity
or
of
nature
and
live
a
certain
way
or
worship
ancestors
or
creation
because
it
gives
them
a
sense
of
happiness
to
do
so


another
common
usage
refers
to
people
who
ascribe
to
ideals
greater
than
themselves


for
many
this
leads
to
a
pursuit
of
some
form
of
enlightenment
often
through
meditation
yoga
fact
date
december
philosophy
or
in
some
cases
a
study
of
metaphysics


many
philosophers
work
to
find
answers
to
spiritual
questions
although
some
may
deny
the
existence
of
a
god
or
any
supernatural
influences


throughout
the
world
however
philosophers
have
often
had
ideas
about
