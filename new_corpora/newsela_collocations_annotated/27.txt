most
kinds
of
fish
have
bones


some
kinds
of
fish
such
as
sharks
and
rays
do
not
have
real
bones
their
skeletons
are
made
of
cartilage
they
are
known
as
<collocation>cartilaginous fish</collocation>


fish
scales
all
fish
are
covered
with
overlapping
scales
and
each
major
group
of
fish
has
its
own
special
type
of
scale


modern
fish
have
what
are
called
scales


these
grow
in
concentric
circles
and
overlap
in
a
head
to
tail
direction
like
<collocation>roof tiles</collocation>


sharks
and
other
have
scales
made
of
like
small
versions
of
their
teeth


these
also
overlap
in
a
head
to
tail
direction
producing
a
tough
outer
layer


shark
skin
is
available
for
purchase
as
a
leather
which
as
original
is
smooth
in
one
direction
and
rough
in
the
other
direction


it
may
be
polished
for
use
but
is
always
rough
in
texture
and
resistant
to
slipping


the
scales
are
usually
covered
with
a
layer
of
slime
which
improves
passage
through
the
water
and
makes
the
fish
more
slippery
to
a
predator


swimming
fish
swim
by
exerting
force
against
the
surrounding
water


there
are
exceptions
but
this
is
usually
done
by
the
fish
contracting
muscles
on
either
side
of
its
body
in
order
to
generate
waves
of
that
travel
the
length
of
the
body
from
nose
to
tail
generally
getting
larger
as
they
go
along


most
fishes
generate
thrust
using
<collocation>lateral movements</collocation>
of
their
body
tail
fin
fin


however
there
are
also
species
which
move
mainly
using
their
median
and
paired
fins


the
latter
group
profits
from
the
gained
that
is
needed
when
living
in
coral
reefs
for
example


but
they
can
not
swim
as
fast
as
fish
using
their
bodies
fins


<collocation>muscle fish</collocation>
can
swim
slowly
for
many
hours
using
red
muscle
fibers


they
also
make
short
fast
bursts
using
white
muscle


the
two
types
of
muscle
have
a
fundamentally
different
physiology


the
red
fibers
are
usually
alongside
a
much
greater
amount
of
white
fibers


white
fibers
the
white
fibers
get
their
energy
by
converting
the
carbohydrate
glycogen
to
lactate
<collocation>lactic acid</collocation>


this
is
anaerobic
metabolism
that
is
it
does
not
need
oxygen


they
are
used
for
fast
short
bursts


once
the
<collocation>lactic acid</collocation>
builds
up
in
the
muscles
they
stop
working
and
it
takes
time
for
the
lactate
to
be
removed
and
the
glycogen
replaced


using
their
white
fibers
fish
can
reach
speeds
of
lengths
per
second
for
short
bursts


red
fibers
swimming
for
long
periods
needs
oxygen
for
the
red
fibers


the
oxygen
supply
has
to
be
constant
because
these
fibers
only
operate
aerobically


they
are
red
because
they
have
a
rich
blood
supply
and
they
contain
myoglobin


myoglobin
transports
the
oxygen
to
the
systems


red
muscle
gets
its
energy
by
fat
which
weight
for
weight
has
twice
as
much
energy
as
carbohydrate
or
protein


using
their
red
fibers
fish
can
keep
up
a
speed
of
lengths
per
second
for
long
periods


body
shape
the
shape
of
the
body
of
a
fish
is
important
to
its
swimming


this
is
because
streamlined
body
shapes
makes
the
water
drag
less


here
are
some
common
fish
shapes


streamlining
the
of
this
shark
makes
it
an
efficient
swimmer


it
is
fast
over
short
distances


the
picture
on
the
right
shows
a
shark


this
shark
shape
is
called
and
it
is
an
<collocation>ovoid shape</collocation>
where
both
ends
of
the
fish
are
pointy


this
is
the
best
shape
for
going
through
water
quickly


fishes
with
shapes
can
<collocation>chase prey</collocation>
and
escape
predators
quickly


many
live
in
the
open
ocean
and
swim
constantly
like
marlins
swordfish
and
tuna


porpoises
dolphins
killer
whales
all
have
similar
shapes


this
is
an
example
of
<collocation>convergent evolution</collocation>


the
long
shape
of
an
eel
body
shows
another
shape


this
enables
them
to
hide
in
cracks
springing
out
quickly
to
capture
prey
then
returning
quickly
to
their
hiding
spot


flatfish
an
adult
flounder
has
both
eyes
on
the
upper
side
of
its
body


flatfish
live
on
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
or
lake


most
use
camouflage
they
change
colors
to
match
the
ocean
floor


compressed
fish
with
compressed
shapes
have
flat
vertical
bodies
with
one
eye
on
each
side


they
swim
upright
and
can
be
very
thin


they
usually
live
in
reefs
where
their
flat
bodies
can
slip
in
and
out
among
the
corals
sponges
and
rocks
keeping
hidden
from
predators


angelfish
and
are
all
compressed
fish


swimming
in
groups
main
and
schooling
many
fish
swim
in
groups
a
lot
of
the
time


schools
of
fish
can
swim
together
for
long
distances
and
may
be
chased
by
predators
which
also
swim
in
schools


casual
groups
are
called
shoals


fish
as
food
people
eat
many
kinds
of
fish


the
fish
that
people
eat
most
include
carp
cod
herring
perch
sardines
sturgeon
trout
tuna
and
many
others


a
person
who
buys
and
sells
fish
for
eating
is
called
a
fishmonger


fishing
main
fishing
the
word
to
fish
is
also
used
for
the
activity
of
catching
fish


people
catch
fish
with
small
nets
from
the
side
of
the
water
or
from
small
boats
or
with
big
nets
from
big
boats


people
can
also
catch
fish
with
fishing
poles
and
fishhooks
with
bait


this
is
often
called
fishing


there
is
also
different
types
of
lures
that
can
be
used


one
is
a
crank
bait


others
are
plastic
worms
and


these
are
lots
of
different
ways
of
catching
fish


fish
as
pets
some
people
keep
fish
as
pets


goldfish
and
siamese
fighting
fish
are
popular
types
of
pet
fish


koi
and
other
ornamental
fish
are
often
kept
by
groups
of
people
in
public
ponds
for
their
beauty
and
