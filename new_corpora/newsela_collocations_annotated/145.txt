the

lived
in
what

now
france


in
those
days
the
land
was
called
gaul
latin


the
romans
spread
their
power
to
and
made
their
provinces


because
the
romans
spoke
latin
the
local
people
learned
latin
and
began
to
speak
it


their
own
language
gaulish
tended
to
be
spoken
less
often
although
breton
is
a
language
still
spoken
today
in
the
part
of
france
called
that
came
from
the
old
celtic
language


after
the
roman
empire
fell
and
germanic
peoples
swarmed
the
countryside
latin
was
changing
quickly
and
in
medieval
france
it
changed
into
two
accents
or
languages
langue
and
langue


they
both
mean
language
of
yes
because
oc
was
the
word
for
yes
in

and
meant
yes
in
the
north


today
the
word
for
yes
in
