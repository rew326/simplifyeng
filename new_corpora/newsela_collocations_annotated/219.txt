for
a
few
weeks
some
people
said
they
saw
and
some
videotapes
of
talking
came
out
but
still
nobody
knows
if
they
were
true
or
not


although
was
placed
at
the
top
of
the
list
he
could
not
be
found
even
when
the
other
leaders
of
the
iraqi
regime
were
arrested


his
sons
and
political
heirs
and
were
killed
in
july
in
a
clash
with
forces
after
a
tip
from
an
iraqi


after
his
capture
by
military


on
december
the
islamic
republic
news
agency
of
iran
first
reported
that

been
arrested


these
reports
were
soon
confirmed
by
other
members
of
the
governing
council
by
military
sources
and
by
british
<collocation>prime minister</collocation>
<collocation>tony blair</collocation>

home
town

had
grown
long
hair
and
a
long
beard

on

talked
with
him
after
the
soldiers
found
him
said
he
was
healthy
and
wanted
to
talk
to
people
and
do
what
they
told
him
to
do


paul
said
that
would
have
a
trial
but
that
he
did
not
know
yet
what
kind
of
trial


the
iraqi

this
symbol
is
often
used
by
anarchists


the
o
represents
order
and
the
a
represents
anarchy


it
means
both
go
together


anarchism
is
a
political
belief
that
is
against
the
domination
of
one
group
or
person
other
another
believing
that
people
can
organize
themselves
without
needing
state
government
or
other
hierarchy
in
power
and
emphasizing
that
such
organizations
can
be
easily
used
for
evil


anarchists
also
believe
that
participation
should
never
be
forced
by
other
people


anarchism
is
a
cluster
of
doctrines
and
attitudes
centered
on
the
belief
that
government
is
both
harmful
and
unnecessary


the
term
anarchism
derives
from
the
greek
without
which
means
without
rulers
not
without
rule
it
is
also
occasionally
translated
as
without
government


in
the
common
language
the
word
anarchy
is
often
used
to
describe
chaos
or


however
anarchists
usually
do
not
promote
this


rather
they
define
anarchy
as
a
way
of
relations
between
people


they
believe
that
once
put
into
place
these
relations
work
on
their
own


principles
individual
freedom
<collocation>voluntary association</collocation>
and
opposition
to
the
state
are
important
beliefs
of
anarchism


there
are
also
big
differences
between
<collocation>anarchist philosophies</collocation>
on
things
like
whether
violence
can
be
used
to
bring
anarchy
the
best
type
of
economy
the
relationship
between
technology
and
hierarchy
the
idea
of
equality
and
the
usefulness
of
some
organization


anarchists
are
not
against
authority
eg


the
authority
of
someone
skilled
in
over
someone
that
wants
to
learn
they
are
only
against
unjust
human
domination


there
are
many
anarchists
who
reject
capitalism
and
support
socialism
or
communism
but
in
another
sense
without
a
totalitarian
state
or
power
they
are
called
and


also
there
are
some
people
called
who
oppose
domination
but
support
capitalism
but
in
another
sense
neither
government
nor
state
capitalism
although
many
of
them
are
okay
with
socialism
between
consenting
participants
as
long
as
they
do
force
them
into
the
socialist
system


other
anarchists
say
that
they
are
not
really
anarchists
because
anarchism
is
traditionally
a
socialist
philosophy


finally
there
are
anarchists
without
adjectives
who
hold
that
because
people
will
be
free
in
an
anarchy
to
pursue
voluntarily
any
economic
structures
they
want
including
communes
worker
and
firms


and
believe
that
people
can
voluntarily
participate
in
systems
without
having
to
be
forced
to
unlike
their
authoritarian
that
believe
everyone
should
be
forced
into
their
system
whether
they
like
it
or
not

the
system
is
based
on
the
operating
system
in
many
ways


apart
from
the
rather
big
size
of
is
much
smaller
and
not
as
packed
with
features
as


it
finds
uses
in
many
places
mostly
dealing
with
sensor
and
data
gathering
of
different
sorts


thanks
to
its
compact
nature
it
can
easily
be
transferred
over
slow
connections


yet
it
is
a
stable
and
robust
system
distributed
as
an
open

share
the
history
of
unix
and
its
variants
unix
often
spelled
unix
when
the
product
trademark
is
not
important
is
a
operating
system


it
was
developed
beginning
in
at
<collocation>bell labs</collocation>


it
was
created
by
ken
thompson
dennis
douglas
and
others
using
the
newly
invented
c
programming
language


the
system
itself
is
a
and
multiprocessing
system
enabling
it
to
perform
applications
support
multiple
applications
at
one
time
and
support
a
large
number
of
users
at
the
same
time


it
also
is
network
oriented
which
means
that
it
is
able
to
operate
well
in
a
network
of
computers


security
is
also
emphasized
in
unix
due
to
the
requirements
of
the
environment
but
also
due
to
the
networking
it
is
primarily
made
for


many
ideas
found
in
unix
were
new


other
<collocation>operating systems</collocation>
copied
them


today
there
are
many
<collocation>operating systems</collocation>
that
have
some
of
the
ideas
of
unix
in
them


for
this
reason
some
people
talk
about
a
unix
philosophy
of
doing
things


one
of
these
systems
with
many
of
the
unix
ideas
in
it
is
called


does
not
use
code
from
unix
it
only
shares
some
of
the
ideas


therefore
is
not
a
unix
operating
system


instead
it
is
called


there
can
be
many
different
users
in
a
operating
system


most
of
them
have
a
personal
area
where
they
can
put
things


this
is
called
a
user
account


the
main
method
of
interacting
with
a
unix
system
is
the
command
line
interface


users
run
commands
and
programs
by
typing
text
characters
the
command
lines


this
is
a
very
powerful
and
flexible
way
of
working
because
it
allows
things
to
be
combined
and
done
automatically
and
it
is
still
used
by
most
unix
users
and
administrators


a
<collocation>graphical user</collocation>
interface
usually
used
by
unix
systems
is
the
x
window
system


the
x
window
system
is
only
a
shell
of
a
<collocation>graphical interface</collocation>


it
is
made
of
many
protocols


the
x
window
system
itself
does
not
provide
decorations
for
windows
or
controls
to
the
user
to
move
and
resize
windows


this
is
handled
by
a
window
manager
or
desktop
manager


some
of
the
popular
<collocation>desktop environments</collocation>
and
<collocation>window managers</collocation>
are
gnome
like
most
other
<collocation>graphical user</collocation>
interfaces
they
use
windows
dialog
boxes
support
the
use
of
a
computer
mouse
and
are
designed
to
be
easy
to
use


there
are
many
thousands
of
programs
available
for
the
x
window
system


programs
like
word
processors
and
spreadsheets
are
available
including
free
and
software


two
kinds
today
there
are
two
kinds
of
<collocation>operating systems</collocation>
that
look
like
unix


the
first
group
contains
all
those
that
have
common
kernel
code
with
the
original
developed
at
<collocation>bell labs</collocation>
later


this
includes
the
commercial
<collocation>unix variants</collocation>
like
or
<collocation>mac os</collocation>
x


the
other
group
includes
free
ones
that
usually
have
in
their
name
like
and
and
systems
based
on
the
kernel


the
free
systems
with
the
exception
of
the
systems
do
not
have
common
code
with
the
original
unix


to
avoid
confusion
many
people
speak
about
unix
and
systems


as
to
the
applications
most
can
be
made
to
run
on
any
modern
unix
or
system


and
gnome
were
developed
for
and
later
to
the
commercial
<collocation>unix variants</collocation>

luther

charlemagne


it
contains
the

a
signature
is
a
special
way
that
people
write
their
name
to
imply
that
they
agree
to
something
which
is
written


a
signature
is
usually
used
by
people
to
sign
letters
they
have
written
cheques
to
show
that
they
agree
to
the
payment
of
some
money
petitions
to
show
their
support
for
views
and
contracts


the
way
people
sign
things
are
different
in
different
countries


in
the
most
people
have
a
signature
which
is
just
made
from
writing
their
name
in
their
own
handwriting
but
in
for
example
young
adults
spend
many
months
practicing
fancy
signatures
which
are
hard
to
copy
and
not
readable


people
who
can
not
write
often
mark
a
signature
of
a
cross


hundreds
of
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
rich
people
used
sealing
wax
to
make
an
impression
of
their
signet
rings
next
to
or
instead
of
a
signature


this
was
called
their
seal
which
is
where
the
term
seal
of
approval
comes
from


some
formal
documents
still
carry
an
official
<collocation>wax seal</collocation>


for
example
if
a
coat
of
arms
is
registered
with
the
college
of
heralds
the
<collocation>registration document</collocation>
carries
a
<collocation>wax seal</collocation>


illegible
signatures
sometimes
one
finds
a
form
where
the
person
is
asked
to
both
print
their
names
so
people
can
read
it
clearly
and
sign
their
name
