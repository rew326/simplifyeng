albert
einstein
march
april
was
a
theoretical
physicist
who
developed
the
general
theory
of
relativity
one
of
the
two
pillars
of
modern
physics
alongside
<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>


he
received
the
nobel
prize
in
physics
in


his
theories
of
special
and
general
relativity
are
of
great
importance
to
many
branches
of
physics
and
astronomy


they
have
been
been
given
experimental
confirmation
by
many
experiments
and
observations


einstein
is
well
known
for
his
theories
about
light
matter
gravity
space
and
time


his
most
well
known
equation
is
e
mc


it
means
that
energy
and
mass
are
different
forms
of
the
same
thing


einstein
published
more
than
scientific
papers
and
over
works


he
received
honorary
doctorate
degrees
in
science
medicine
and
philosophy
from
many
european
and
american
universities


near
the
beginning
of
<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii
he
warned
president
franklin
roosevelt
that
germany
might
be
developing
an
atomic
weapon
and
recommended
that
the
begin
nuclear
weapons
research


that
research
begun
by
a
newly
established
manhattan
project
resulted
in
the
becoming
the
first
and
only
country
to
have
nuclear
weapons
during
the
war

early
life
einstein
was
born
at
in
germany
on
march


his
family
was
jewish
but
was
not
very
religious


however
later
in
life
einstein
became
very
interested
in
his
judaism


einstein
did
not
begin
speaking
until
after
age
two


according
to
his
younger
sister
he
had
such
difficulty
with
language
that
those
around
him
feared
he
would
never
learn


when
einstein
was
around
four
his
father
gave
him
a
magnetic
compass


he
tried
hard
to
understand
how
the
needle
could
seem
to
move
itself
so
that
it
always
pointed
north


the
needle
was
in
a
closed
case
so
clearly
nothing
like
wind
could
be
pushing
the
needle
around
and
yet
it
moved


so
in
this
way
einstein
became
interested
in
studying
science
and
mathematics


his
compass
inspired
him
to
explore
the
world
of
science


when
he
became
older
he
went
to
a
school
in
switzerland


after
he
graduated
he
got
a
job
in
the
patent
office
there


while
he
was
working
there
he
wrote
the
papers
that
first
made
him
famous
as
a
great
scientist


einstein
had
two
severely
disabled
children
with
his
first
wife


his
daughter
her
real
name
may
never
be
known
was
born
about
a
year
before
their
marriage
in
january


she
spent
her
very
short
life
believed
to
be
less
than
years
in
the
care
of
serbian
grandparents
where
it
is
believed
she
died
from
<collocation>scarlet fever</collocation>


some
believe
she
may
have
been
born
with
the
disorder
called
<collocation>down syndrome</collocation>
but
it
has
never
been
proved


her
very
existence
only
became
known
to
the
world
in
when
a
shoe
box
containing
love
letters
mostly
from
einstein
exchanged
between
and
einstein
from
late
to
september
was
discovered
by
einstein
granddaughter
in
an
attic
in
california


their
son
was
diagnosed
with
schizophrenia


he
spent
decades
in
hospitals
and
died
in
the
zurich
sanatorium
in


in
einstein
became
very
sick
with
an
illness
that
almost
killed
him


his
cousin
nursed
him
back
to
health


after
this
happened
einstein
divorced
and
married
on
june


just
before
the
start
of
<collocation>world war</collocation>
i
he
moved
back
to
germany
and
became
director
of
a
school
there


he
lived
in
berlin
until
the
nazi
government
came
to
power


the
nazis
hated
people
who
were
jewish
or
who
came
from
jewish
families


they
accused
einstein
of
helping
to
create
jewish
physics
and
german
physicists
tried
to
prove
that
his
theories
were
wrong


in
under
death
threats
from
the
nazis
and
hated
by
the
german
press
einstein
and
moved
to
princeton
new
jersey
in
the
united
states
and
in
he
became
a
united
states
citizen


during
<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii
einstein
and
wrote
to
the
president
franklin
roosevelt
to
say
that
the
united
states
should
invent
an
atomic
bomb
so
that
the
nazi
government
could
not
beat
them
to
the
punch


he
was
the
only
one
who
signed
the
letter


he
was
however
not
part
of
the
manhattan
project
which
was
the
project
that
created
the
atomic
bomb


einstein
a
jew
but
not
an
israeli
citizen
was
offered
the
presidency
in
but
turned
it
down
stating
i
am
deeply
moved
by
the
offer
from
our
state
of
israel
and
at
once
saddened
and
ashamed
that
i
can
not
accept
it


was
reported
to
be
considering
offering
the
presidency
to
another
but
he
was
said
to
be
very
not
interested


he
taught
physics
at
the
institute
for
<collocation>advanced study</collocation>
at
princeton
new
jersey
until
his
death
on
april
of
a
burst
aortic
aneurysm


he
was
still
writing
about
quantum
physics
hours
before
he
died


he
was
awarded
the
nobel
prize
in
physics


theory
of
special
relativity
the
theory
of
special
relativity
was
published
by
einstein
in
in
a
paper
called
on
the
of
moving
bodies


it
says
that
both
distance
measurements
and
time
measurements
change
near
the
speed
of
light


this
means
that
as
you
get
closer
to
the
speed
of
light
nearly
kilometres
per
second
lengths
appear
to
get
shorter
and
clocks
tick
more
slowly


einstein
said
that
special
relativity
is
based
on
two
ideas


the
first
is
that
the
laws
of
physics
are
the
same
for
all
observers
that
are
not
moving
in
relation
to
each
other


all
the
people
on
a
jet
airplane
would
not
be
moving
much
in
relation
to
each
other
but
the
people
in
two
different
jet
airplanes
that
come
toward
each
other
would
be
moving
toward
each
other
very
fast


the
people
who
are
all
going
in
the
same
direction
at
the
same
speed
are
said
to
be
in
an
inertial
frame


the
second
idea
is
that
any
observer
no
matter
how
fast
that
observer
moves
in
relation
to
us
is
always
the
same


a
vacuum
is
a
volume
without
any
matter
in
it


light
from
both
stars
is
measured
as
having
the
same
speed
people
who
are
in
the
same
frame
think
of
them
as
being
in
a
big
box
so
that
they
all
go
places
together
and
at
the
same
speed
will
measure
how
long
something
takes
to
happen
in
the
same
way


their
clocks
will
keep
the
same
time


but
people
moving
in
another
frame
will
look
over
at
them
and
see
that
their
clocks
were
moving
at
a
different
rate


the
reason
that
this
happens
is
actually
quite
simple


it
is
the
consequence
of
two
ideas


one
idea
we
have
seen
already


no
matter
what
you
are
doing
even
if
you
are
moving
toward
a
<collocation>distant star</collocation>
at
half
the
speed
of
light
or
if
you
are
moving
away
from
it
at
half
the
speed
of
light
or
any
other
speed
it
does
not
matter
if
you
measure
the
speed
of
the
light
coming
from
that
star
it
will
always
be
the
same
number


the
other
idea
goes
against
our
ordinary
ideas


the
other
idea
says
that
who
is
standing
still
and
who
is
moving
is
whoever
you
say
is
standing
still
or
moving


how
can
that
be


imagine
you
were
all
alone
in
a
different
universe


that
universe
has
no
suns
planets
or
anything
else


it
just
has
you
and
your
spaceship


are
you
moving


are
you
standing
still


those
questions
do
not
mean
anything


because
when
we
say
we
are
moving
we
mean
that
we
can
measure
our
distance
from
something
else
at
one
time
and
measure
the
distance
at
another
time
and
the
numbers
will
not
be
the
same


if
the
numbers
get
bigger
we
are
moving
away


if
the
numbers
get
smaller
we
are
moving
closer


suppose
a
sailor
is
standing
on
the
edge
of
a
very
long
boat
with
a
flat
top


her
boyfriend
is
standing
on
the
dock


they
are
still
very
close
together
so
they
shout
to
each
other


the
boat
starts
to
leave


the
sailor
runs
toward
the
back
of
the
boat
at
the
same
speed
that
the
boat
moves
forward
so
she
and
her
boyfriend
can
keep
talking


as
far
as
her
boyfriend
is
concerned
she
is
not
moving


so
to
have
movement
you
must
have
at
least
two
things


we
do
not
think
about
it
because
when
we
sit
on
the
earth
in
a
park
which
is
moving
very
fast
around
the
sun
we
think
we
are
not
moving
because
we
do
not
get
any
closer
or
farther
away
from
the
trees
in
the
park


now
imagine
that
another
spaceship
appears
in
this
other
universe


on
your
spaceship
you
say
that
their
spaceship
is
coming
closer
to
yours


after
all
you
do
not
feel
yourself
moving


on
their
spaceship
they
say
that
your
spaceship
is
coming
closer
to
theirs


they
do
not
feel
themselves
to
be
moving
either


somebody
on
an
airplane
can
be
moving
at
several
hundred
kilometers
per
hour
but
they
say
i
am
just
sitting
here


distance
traveled
is
relative
to
different
standards
of
reference
let
us
try
to
stretch
our
minds
a
bit


imagine
that
a
basketball
player
is
on
a
glass
airplane
on
the
ground


people
outside
can
see
him
very
easily


he
begins
to
walk
from
the
back
of
the
airplane
toward
the
front
of
the
airplane
bouncing
his
basketball
as
he
goes


maybe
the
distance
between
the
places
where
his
basketball
hits
the
floor
of
the
airplane
is
about
one
meter
or
one
yard


if
some
people
are
under
the
airplane
they
can
mark
the
place
directly
under
the
airplane
where
the
ball
hits
the
floor


those
marks
are
a
meter
or
maybe
a
yard
apart


so
everybody
agrees
that
the
bounces
are
about
a
meter
or
a
yard
apart


later
the
plane
takes
off


people
still
watch
it
from
on
the
ground


but
this
time
bounce
number
is
over
a
place
in
gibraltar
and
bounce
number
is
over
a
place
in
spain


the
distance
between
bounces
is
measured
in
kilometers
or
miles
on
the
ground
but
the
people
on
the
plane
get
the
same
answers
they
did
while
the
plane
was
on
the
ground


now
suppose
some
people
are
on
a
big
spaceship
and
they
want
to
make
a
very
accurate
clock


so
they
make
a
long
tunnel
between
decks
from
what
would
be
like
the
top
of
an
airplane
to
what
would
be
the
bottom
of
an
airplane


at
one
end
they
put
a
mirror
and
at
the
other
end
they
put
a
simple
machine


it
shoots
one
short
burst
of
light
toward
the
mirror
and
then
waits


the
light
hits
the
mirror
and
bounces
back


when
it
hits
a
light
detector
on
the
machine
the
machine
says
count
it
simultaneously
shoots
another
short
burst
of
light
toward
the
mirror
and
when
that
light
comes
back
the
machine
says
count


of
course
since
light
is
very
fast
the
count
changes
very
fast


they
decide
that
a
certain
number
of
bounces
will
be
defined
as
a
second
and
they
make
the
machine
change
the
seconds
counter
every
time
it
has
detected
that
number
of
bounces


every
time
it
changes
the
seconds
counter
it
also
flashes
a
light
out
through
a
porthole
under
the
machine


so
somebody
out
taking
a
space
walk
will
see
the
light
flashing
every
second


light
clock
faster
at
rest
and
slower
in
motion
every
grade
school
child
learns
the
formula
d
rt
distance
equals
rate
multiplied
by
time


we
know
the
speed
of
light
and
we
can
easily
measure
the
distance
between
the
machine
and
the
mirror
and
multiple
that
to
give
the
distance
the
light
travels


so
we
have
both
d
and
r
and
we
can
easily
calculate
t


the
people
on
the
spaceship
compare
their
new
light
clock
with
their
various
wrist
watches
and
other
clocks
and
they
are
satisfied
that
they
can
<collocation>measure time</collocation>
well
using
their
new
light
clock


now
this
spaceship
happens
to
be
going
very
fast


it
is
not
coming
to
earth
to
visit
but
it
does
happen
to
fly
over
the
north
pole


there
is
a
science
station
with
a
telescope
at
the
north
pole


they
see
a
flash
from
the
clock
on
the
space
ship
and
then
they
see
another
flash


only
the
flashes
do
not
come
a
second
apart


they
come
at
a
slower
rate


the
reason
is
that
the
situation
is
like
the
basketball
player
on
the
airplane


the
ball
is
pushed
downward
by
the
player
hand


that
is
the
light
in
the
spaceship
machine
firing
off
a
burst
toward
the
mirror


the
ball
hits
the
floor
and
bounces


that
is
like
the
light
hitting
the
mirror
and
being
reflected


the
ball
returns
to
the
player
hand


that
is
like
the
light
hitting
the
machine
and
triggering
a
new
burst
of
light


note
that
the
distance
between
the
place
on
the
ground
where
the
basketball
is
seen
to
hit
the
floor
and
the
distance
on
the
ground
where
the
basketball
is
seen
to
return
to
the
basketball
player
hand
is
some
great
distance


depending
on
how
fast
the
plane
is
going
it
might
be
a
kilometer
or
even
a
mile
away


so
the
man
on
the
north
pole
sees
the
light
flash
on
the
side
of
the
spaceship
when
it
is
thousands
of
miles
away
and
then
sees
the
next
flash
when
the
spaceship
has
gotten
thousands
of
miles
closer


the
way
the
north
pole
man
sees
it
the
light
started
out
let
say
miles
away
and
hit
its
return
point
when
it
was
perhaps
miles
away


so
instead
of
just
traveling
twice
the
diameter
of
the
space
ship
perhaps
several
hundred
meters
or
yards
the
light
has
traveled
miles


light
always
goes
at
the
same
speed
d
rt
and
so
the
time
this
trip
took
is
going
to
be
much
greater
as
seen
by
the
man
on
the
north
pole


that
is
why
the
clock
on
the
spaceship
is
not
flashing
once
a
second
for
the
earth
observer


special
relativity
also
relates
energy
with
mass
in
albert
einstein
e
mc
formula


e
mc
also
called
the
is
one
of
the
things
that
einstein
is
most
famous
for


it
is
a
famous
equation
in
physics
and
math
that
shows
what
happens
when
mass
changes
to
energy
or
energy
changes
to
mass


the
e
in
the
equation
stands
for
energy


energy
is
a
number
which
you
give
to
objects
depending
on
how
much
they
can
change
other
things


for
instance
a
brick
hanging
over
an
egg
can
put
enough
energy
onto
the
egg
to
break
it


a
feather
hanging
over
an
egg
does
not
have
enough
energy
to
hurt
the
egg


there
are
three
basic
forms
of
energy
potential
energy
<collocation>kinetic energy</collocation>
and
rest
energy


two
of
these
forms
of
energy
can
be
seen
in
the
examples
given
above
and
in
the
example
of
a
pendulum


a
cannon
ball
hangs
on
a
rope
from
an
iron
ring


a
horse
pulls
the
cannon
ball
to
the
right
side


when
the
cannon
ball
is
released
it
will
move
back
and
forth
as
diagrammed


it
would
do
that
forever
except
that
the
movement
of
the
rope
in
the
ring
and
rubbing
in
other
places
causes
friction
and
the
friction
takes
away
a
little
energy
all
the
time


if
we
ignore
the
losses
due
to
friction
then
the
energy
provided
by
the
horse
is
given
to
the
cannon
ball
as
potential
energy


it
has
energy
because
it
is
up
high
and
can
fall
down


as
the
cannon
ball
swings
down
it
gains
more
and
more
speed
so
the
nearer
the
bottom
it
gets
the
faster
it
is
going
and
the
harder
it
would
hit
you
if
you
stood
in
front
of
it


then
it
slows
down
as
its
<collocation>kinetic energy</collocation>
is
changed
back
into
potential
energy


<collocation>kinetic energy</collocation>
just
means
the
energy
something
has
because
it
is
moving


potential
energy
just
means
the
energy
something
has
because
it
is
in
some
higher
position
than
something
else


when
energy
moves
from
one
form
to
another
the
amount
of
energy
always
remains
the
same


it
can
not
be
made
or
destroyed


this
rule
is
called
the
conservation
law
of
energy


for
example
when
you
throw
a
ball
the
energy
is
transferred
from
your
hand
to
the
ball
as
you
release
it


but
the
energy
that
was
in
your
hand
and
now
the
energy
that
is
in
the
ball
is
the
same
number


for
a
long
time
people
thought
that
the
conservation
of
energy
was
all
there
was
to
talk
about


when
energy
transforms
into
mass
the
amount
of
energy
does
not
remain
the
same


when
mass
transforms
into
energy
the
amount
of
energy
also
does
not
remain
the
same


however
the
amount
of
matter
and
energy
remains
the
same


energy
turns
into
mass
and
mass
turns
into
energy
in
a
way
that
is
defined
by
einstein
equation
e
mc


a
picture
of
einstein
after
winning
his
nobel
prize
the
m
in
einstein
equation
stands
for
mass


mass
is
the
amount
of
matter
there
is
in
some
body


if
you
knew
the
number
of
protons
and
neutrons
in
a
piece
of
matter
such
as
a
brick
then
you
could
calculate
its
total
mass
as
the
sum
of
the
masses
of
all
the
protons
and
of
all
the
neutrons


electrons
are
so
small
that
they
are
almost
negligible


masses
pull
on
each
other
and
a
very
large
mass
such
as
that
of
the
earth
pulls
very
hard
on
things
nearby


you
would
weigh
much
more
on
jupiter
than
on
earth
because
jupiter
is
so
huge


you
would
weigh
much
less
on
the
moon
because
it
is
only
about
the
mass
of
earth


weight
is
related
to
the
mass
of
the
brick
or
the
person
and
the
mass
of
whatever
is
pulling
it
down
on
a
spring
scale
which
may
be
smaller
than
the
smallest
moon
in
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
or
larger
than
the
sun


mass
not
weight
can
be
transformed
into
energy


another
way
of
expressing
this
idea
is
to
say
that
matter
can
be
transformed
into
energy


units
of
mass
are
used
to
measure
the
amount
of
matter
in
something


the
mass
or
the
amount
of
matter
in
something
determines
how
much
energy
that
thing
could
be
changed
into


albert
einstein
energy
can
also
be
transformed
into
mass
