a
soapbox
is
a
temporary
platform
used
to
give
a
speech


during
the
century
soap
was
transported
in
wooden
boxes


when
a
person
had
new
or
unusual
ideas
and
wanted
to
talk
to
a
crowd
about
them
sometimes
he
or
she
would
stand
on
an
empty
soapbox
so
that
everyone
could
see
and
hear
the
talk
well


people
sometimes
use
the
word
soapbox
to
mean
a
place
to
say
new
or
unusual
things

tv
series
the
word
supernatural
is
used
for
things
that
some
people
believe
are
real
but
that
are
not
part
of
nature


because
we
can
not
prove
whether
these
things
are
real
people
often
disagree
about
these
things


some
say
that
we
should
talk
about
things
without
talking
about
the
supernatural
because
we
can
not
prove
that
supernatural
things
are
real


other
people
say
that
although
we
can
not
prove
supernatural
things
in
a
scientific
way
they
are
real


some
examples
of
supernatural
things
are

are
also
called
spirits
as
a
plural
not
spirit


a
spirit
is
considered
to
be
the
part
of
a
being
that
is
not
the
body


other
words
with
the
same
meanings
are
soul
and
ghost


when
a
body
is
alive
it
has
a
spirit
in
it


death
is
when
the
spirit
separates
from
the
body


christians
believe
that
spirits
exist
in
heaven
or
hell


see
timothy
spiritualists
believe
that
spirits
can
talk
with
people
or
change
things
in
the
world


many
religions
forbid
communicating
with
such
spirits
in
any
way
see
leviticus
but
a
few
include
this
as
part
of
their
practice


another
use
of
spirit
means
the
main
purpose
or
meaning
of
a
sentence
or
document


for
example
the
spirit
of
a
law
is
the
true
meaning
of
the
law
which
the
creator
wanted


this
phrase
is
often
used
when
the
words
and
sentences
of
a
law
could
mean
more
than
one
thing
but
a
judge
must
decide
what
meaning
is
correct

a
seed
is
the
part
of
a
seed
plant
which
can
grow
into
a
new
plant


it
is
a
reproductive
structure
which
disperses
and
can
survive
for
some
time


a
typical
seed
includes
three
basic
parts
an
embryo
a
supply
of
nutrients
for
the
embryo
and
a
seed
coat


there
are
many
different
kinds
of
seeds


some
plants
make
a
lot
of
seeds
some
make
only
a
few


seeds
are
often
hard
and
very
small
but
some
are
larger


the
coconut
is
as
big
as
a
child
head
but
it
contains
more
than
just
a
seed


at
the
start
seeds
are
dormant
resting
inside
their
coat
for
a
while


when
the
seed
is
ready
to
develop
it
needs
water
air
and
warmth
but
not
sunlight
to
become
a
seedling


seeds
carry
the
food
that
helps
the
new
plant
begin
to
grow


this
food
store
is
in
the

the


many
kinds
of
seeds
are
good
food
for
animals
and
people


the
many
kinds
of
grain
that
people
grow
such
as
rice
wheat
and
maize
are
all
seeds


seeds
are
often
inside
fruits


development
from
the
seed
a
seed
though
not
active
is
a
tiny
living
thing


it
contains
the
embryo
of
the
future
plant
which
is
not
changing
or
developing
it
is
dormant


the
common
idea
is
that
the
seed
sleeps
until
it
gets
what
it
needs
to
wake
up


that
is
not
correct


different
seeds
have
different
habits
no
doubt
adapted
to
their
habitat


there
are
different
kinds
of
resting
stages
in
seeds


seed
dormancy
means
the
seed
does
not
develop
for
a
while
even
when
conditions
are
suitable


delayed
germination
development
allows
time
for
dispersal


changes
take
place
inside
the
seed
which
sooner
or
later
make
it
germinate


the
details
vary
hugely
between
species


seed
hibernation
fails
to
germinate
because
conditions
are
not
right


growth
is
triggered
by
particular
events
in
the
environment


details
of
the
triggers
are
known
for
some
but
not
all
seeds


rain
fire
ground
temperature
are
examples


many
seeds
only
germinate
after
they
have
been
eaten
and
passed
through
the
<collocation>digestive system</collocation>
of
an
animal


this
also
is
a
dispersal
method


when
a
seed
germinates
wakes
up
it
begins
to
grow
into
a
little
plant
called
a
seedling


it
uses
the
soft
fleshy
material
inside
the
seed
for
nutrients
food
until
it
is
ready
to
make
food
on
its
own
using
sunlight
water
and
air


most
seeds
germinate
underground
where
there
is
no
sunlight


the
plant
does
not
need
the
nutrients
in
soil
for
a
few
days
or
weeks
because
the
seed
has
all
the
things
it
needs
to
grow


later
though
it
will
begin
to
need
sunlight


if
there
is
sunlight
the
plant
will
use
it
to
grow
healthy


if
there
is
no
light
the
plant
will
still
grow
for
a
while
but
its
will
not
mature
the
chlorophyll
does
not
turn
green


if
the
plant
does
not
get
enough
light
it
will
eventually
die


it
needs
light
to
make
food
for
itself
when
the
reserve
in
the
seed
runs
out


the
oldest
carbon
dated
seed
that
has

was
a

the
spores
would
land

only
in
<collocation>favourable conditions</collocation>


spores
have
little
food
stored
and
may
be
just
single

rather
than

the
evolution
of
seeds
changed
the
plant
life
cycle
by
freeing
plants
from
the
need
for
external
water
for
<collocation>sexual reproduction</collocation>
and
by
providing
protection
and
nutrients
for
the
developing

these
functions
allowed
plants
to
expand
beyond
the
<collocation>immediate neighborhood</collocation>
of
water
sources


they
were
able
to
exploit
environments
which
were
drier

this
can
be
seen
by
the
success
of
seed
plants
in
important
biological
on
land
from
forests
to
grasslands
both
in
hot

climates


the

the

<collocation>years ago</collocation>
which
is
probably
the
theater
of

about
the
christian
day
of
rest
the
jewish
day
of
rest
shabbat
sabbath
in
christianity
is
the
day
of
rest
and
service
to
god


the
idea
of
the
sabbath
in
christianity
comes
directly
from
the
idea
of
the
sabbath
or
shabbat
in
judaism


in
fact
the
word
sabbath
itself
comes
from
the
hebrew
word
shabbat


like
the
jewish
sabbath
shabbat
the
sabbath
in
christianity
comes
from
the
genesis
story
of
creation


but
unlike
jews
most
christians
have
sabbath
on
sunday
not
saturday


they
also
rest
but
not
the
same
way
as
jews


the
exact
way
depends
on
the
church
denomination


differing
views
complex
section
date
may
most
christians
honor
the
sabbath
on
sunday
to
remember
the
resurrection
of
jesus
on
the
first
day
of
the
week
on
the
jewish
calendar


they
say
that
there
is
an
analogy
between
the
obligation
of
the
christian
day
of
worship
and
the
ordinance


these
two
rules
are
not
literally
identical
though


they
say
that
this
ordinance
is
no
longer
valid
because
god
has
replaced
his
old
creation
by
a
new
one


for
this
reason
the
obligation
to
keep
the
sabbath
is
not
the
same
for
christians
as
for
jews


they
say
there
are
examples
in
the
new
testament
and
in
other
writings
surviving
from
the
first
few
centuries


some
conservative
christians
are


most
of
these
follow
the
<collocation>reformed traditions</collocation>


think
the
first
day
of
the
week
or
lord
day
is
the
new
sabbath


this
is
because
the
commandment
has
never
been
revoked
and
is
in
any
case
a
<collocation>creation ordinance</collocation>


still
others
believe
that
the
sabbath
remains
as
a
day
of
rest
on
the
saturday
reserving
sunday
as
a
day
of
worship


in
reference
to
acts
the
disciples
came
together
on
the
first
day
of
the
week
sunday
to
break
bread
and
to
hear
the
preaching
of
the
apostle
paul


this
is
not
the
first
time
christians
assembled
together
on
a
sunday
jesus
appeared
to
the
christians
on
the
first
day
of
the
week
while
they
were
in
hiding


one
can
maintain
this
argument
in
that
jesus
himself
maintained
the
sabbath
although
not
within
the
restrictions
that
were
mandated
by
jewish
traditions
the
pharisees
often
tried
jesus
by
asking
him
if
certain
tasks
were
acceptable
according
to
the
law


this
would
seem
to
show
that
while
the
sabbath
was
still
of
importance
to
the
jews
sunday
was
a
separate
day
for
worship
and
teaching
from
scriptures


the
adventists
and
other
churches
disagree
with
some
of
these
views


they
argue
that
the
custom
of
meeting
for
worship
on
sunday
originated
in
paganism
specifically
sol
and
in
which
sun
god
worship
took
place
on
sunday
fact
date
december


this
is
therefore
an
explicit
rejection
of
the
commandment
to
keep
the
seventh
day
holy


instead
they
keep
saturday
as
the
sabbath
as
a
memorial
to
god
work
of
creation
believing
that
none
of
the
ten
commandments
can
ever
be
destroyed


claim
that
the
seventh
day
sabbath
was
kept
by
the
majority
of
christian
groups
until
the
and
century
by
most
until
the
and
century
and
a
few
thereafter
but
because
of
opposition
to
judaism
after
the
wars
the
original
custom
was
gradually
replaced
by
sunday
as
the
day
of
worship


the
history
of
these
changes
is
certainly
not
altogether
lost
regardless
of
any
belief
in
a
suppression
of
the
facts
by
a
conspiracy
of
the
pagans
of
the
roman
empire
and
the
clergy
of
the
catholic
church


jews
had
come
to
be
hated
in
the
roman
empire
after
the
wars


this
led
to
the
of
the
jewish
sabbath


hatred
of
jews
is
apparent
in
the
council
of
century
ad
where
canon
states
it
is
not
lawful
to
receive
portions
sent
from
the
feasts
of
jews
or
heretics
nor
to
feast
together
with
them


and
it
is
not
lawful
to
receive
<collocation>unleavened bread</collocation>
from
the
jews
nor
to
be
of
their


in
keeping
with
this
rejection
of
the
jews
this
roman
council
also
the
jewish
sabbath
as
can
be
seen
in
canon
of
the
council
christians
must
not
by
resting
on
the
sabbath
but
must
work
on
that
day
rather
honoring
the
lord
day
and
if
they
can
resting
then
as
christians


but
if
any
shall
be
found
to
be
let
them
be
excommunicated
from
christ


in
the
gospel
of
mark
jesus
says
the
son
of
man
is
lord
even
of
the
sabbath

enables
the
collection
analysis
understanding
and
presentation
of
data


it
helps
in
the
study
of
many
other
fields
such
as
medicine
economics
psychology
and
marketing


someone
who
works
in
statistics
is
called
a
statistician


statistics
provides
ways
to
get
the
data
needed
for
a
study
without
waste
such
as
surveys
and
controlled
experiments


once
the
data
has
been
collected
there
are
two
basic
ways
that
data
can
be
analyzed
first
statistics
can
help
describe
the
data


this
is
known
as
descriptive
statistics


descriptive
statistics
is
about
<collocation>finding meaningful</collocation>
ways
to
summarize
the
data
because
it
is
easier
to
use
the
summary
than
having
to
use
the
whole
set
of
data
all
the
time


the
data
also
allows
to
find
common
patterns


in
statistics
such
patterns
are
called
probability


the
basic
idea
is
to
look
at
the
results
of
an
experiment
and
look
at
how
the
results
are
grouped


once
the
results
have
been
summarized
and
described
they
can
be
used
for
prediction


this
is
called
statistics


as
an
example
the
size
of
an
animal
is
dependent
on
many
factors


some
of
these
factors
are
controlled
by
the
environment
but
others
are
by
inheritance


a
biologist
might
therefore
make
a
model
that
says
that
there
a
high
probability
the
offspring
will
be
small
in
size
if
the
parents
were
small
in
size


this
model
probably
allows
to
predict
the
size
in
better
ways
than
by
just
guessing
at
random


testing
whether
a
certain
drug
can
be
used
to
cure
a
certain
condition
or
disease
is
usually
done
by
comparing
the
results
of
people
who
are
given
the
drug
against
those
of
people
who
are
given
a
placebo

history
statistics
have
been
in
use
for
a
long
time


the
first
known
statistics
are
census
data


the
babylonians
did
a
census
around
the
egyptians
around
and
the
ancient
chinese
around


collecting
data
before
we
can
describe
the
world
with
statistics
we
must
collect
data


the
data
that
we
collect
in
statistics
are
called
measurements


after
we
collect
data
we
use
one
or
more
numbers
to
describe
each
observation
or
measurement


for
example
suppose
we
want
to
find
out
how
popular
a
certain
tv
show
is


we
can
pick
a
group
of
people
called
a
sample
out
of
the
total
population
of
viewers


then
we
ask
each
one
how
often
they
watch
the
show
or
better
we
measure
it
by
attaching
a
counter
to
each
of
their
television
sets


for
another
example
if
we
want
to
know
whether
a
certain
drug
can
help
lower
blood
pressure
we
could
give
the
drug
to
people
for
some
time
and
measure
their
blood
pressure
before
and
after


methods
most
often
we
collect
statistical
data
by
doing
surveys
or
experiments


to
do
a
survey
we
pick
a
small
number
of
people
and
ask
them
questions


then
we
use
their
answers
as
the
data


the
choice
of
which
individuals
to
take
for
a
survey
or
data
collection
is
important
as
it
directly
influences
the
statistics


when
the
statistics
are
done
it
can
no
longer
be
determined
which
individuals
are
taken
