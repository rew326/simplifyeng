or
herself

for

what
art
means
some
people
say
that
art
is
a
product
or
item
that
is
made
with
the
intention
of
stimulating
the
human
senses
as
well
as
the
human
mind
or
spirit


an
artwork
is
normally
judged
by
how
much
impact
it
has
on
people
the
amount
of
people
who
can
relate
to
it
and
how
much
people
appreciate
it


the
first
and
<collocation>broadest sense</collocation>
of
art
means
arrangement
or
to
arrange


in
this
sense
art
is
created
when
someone
arranges
things
found
in
the
world
into
a
new
or
different
design
or
form
or
when
someone
arranges
colors
next
to
each
other
in
a
painting
to
make
an
image
or
just
to
make
a
pretty
or
interesting
design


art
can
also
be
a
form
of
expression
of
emotion


the
artist
may
feel
a
certain
emotion
and
feels
there
is
no
other
way
to
express
it
than
to
create
something
that
means
something
to
them


most
of
the
art
created
in
this
case
is
made
for
the
artist
rather
than
an
audience


though
if
an
audience
is
able
to
connect
with
the
emotion
as
well
then
the
art
work
will
become
publicly
successful


history
of
art
there
are
sculptures
cave
painting
and
rock
art
dating
from
the
<collocation>upper paleolithic</collocation>
era


all
of
the
great
ancient
civilizations
such
as
ancient
egypt
india
china
greece
rome
or
arabia
had
works
and
styles
of
art


in
the
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>
most
of
the
art
in
europe
showed
people
from
the

in

stained

were
done

music
painting
drama
and
fiction


there
are
many
chinese
<collocation>artistic styles</collocation>
which
are
usually
named
after
the
ruling
dynasty


in
europe
after
the
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>
there
was
a
renaissance
which
means
rebirth


people
rediscovered
science
and
artists
were
allowed
to
paint
subjects
other
than
religious
subjects


people
like
michelangelo
and
leonardo
<collocation>da vinci</collocation>
still
painted
religious
pictures
but
they
also
now
could
<collocation>paint mythological</collocation>
pictures
too


these
artists
also
invented
perspective
where
things
in
the
distance
look
smaller
than
things
close
up
in
the
picture


this
was
new
because
in
the
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>
people
would
paint
all
the
figures
close
up
and
just
overlapping
each
other


in
the
late
artists
in
europe
responding
to
modernity
created
many
new
painting
styles
such
as
romanticism
realism
and
impressionism


the
history
of
twentieth
century
art
includes
expressionism
fauvism
cubism
and
surrealism
and


roles
of
art
in
some
societies
people
think
that
art
belongs
to
the
person
who
made
it
such
as
<collocation>indigenous aboriginal</collocation>
australian
art


they
think
that
the
artist
put
his
or
her
talent
into
the
art


in
this
view
the
art
is
the
property
of
the
artist


in
other
societies
people
think
that
art
belongs
to
no
one


they
think
that
society
has
put
its
social
capital
into
the
artist
and
the
artist
work


in
this
view
society
is
a
collective
that
has
made
the
art
through
the
artist
