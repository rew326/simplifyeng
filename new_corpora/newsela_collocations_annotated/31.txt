money

who

which
is

<collocation>constitutional monarchies</collocation>


in

<collocation>absolute monarchy</collocation>
the

dictatorship
under
a
dictatorship
the
government
is
run
by
one
person
who
has
all
the
power
over
the
people
in
a
country


originally
the
roman
republic
made
dictators
to
lead
during
time
of
war


the
roman
dictators

were
not

oligarchy
an
oligarchy
is
a
government
ruled
by
a
small
group
of
powerful
people


these
people
may
spread
power
equally
or
not
equally


an
oligarchy
is
different
from
a
true
democracy
because
very
few
people
are
given
the
chance
to
change
things


an
oligarchy
does
not
have
to
be
hereditary
or
passed
down
from
father
to
son


an
oligarchy
does
not
have
one
clear
ruler
but
several
powerful
people


some
past
examples
of
oligarchy
are
the
former
union
of
soviet
<collocation>socialist republics</collocation>
and
apartheid
south
africa


a
fictional
example
is
the
society
of

book
nineteen


some
critics
of
<collocation>representative democracy</collocation>
think
of
the
united
states
as
an
oligarchy


this
view
is
shared
by
anarchists


the
history
and
the
theory
of
government
the
simplest
idea
of
government
is
those
who
rule
over
people
and
land


this
may
be
as
small
as
a
community
with
some
sort
of
board
that
looks
after
the
goings
on
of
those
who
live
within
it
or
something
a
little
larger
like
a
village
or
as
big
as
a
continent
like
australia
and
india


those
people
who
rule
the
land
can
allow
others
to
own
it


it
is
a
deed
by
government
that
gives
this
right
in
the
way
that
laws
describe


some
think
they
have
the
right
to
hold
land
without
government
permission


this
view
is
called
libertarianism


others
think
they
can
do
so
together
as
a
group
with
others
if
they
live
in
peace
without
government


this
view
is
called
anarchism


almost
every
place
on
earth
is
connected
to
one
and
only
one
government


places
without
government
are
where
people
follow
traditions
instead
of
government
rules
small
border
disputed
areas
and
the
continent
of
antarctica
because
almost
no
people
live
there


for
every
other
place
on
earth
there
is
a
government
that
claims
sovereign
control
over
it


the
word
sovereign
is
old
and
means
control
by
a
king
sovereign


governments
of
villages
cities
counties
and
other
communities
are
also
subordinate
to
the
government
of
the
state
or
province
where
they
exist
and
then
to
that
of
the
country


it
is
from
kings
and
feudalism
that
modern
governments
and
nation
states
came


the
capital
of
a
country
for
instance
is
where
the
king
kept
his
assets


from
this
we
get
the
modern
idea
of
capital
in
economics


a
government
is
said
to
regulate
trade
as
well
as
to
rule
over
land


governments
also
control
people
and
decide
things
about
what
morality
to
accept
or
punish


in
very
many
countries
there
are
strict
rules
about
<collocation>sexual intercourse</collocation>
and
drugs
that
are
part
of
law
and
offenders
are
punished
for
disobeying
them


tax
is
how
government
is
paid
for
in
most
countries


people
who
buy
sell
import
invest
own
a
house
or
land
or
earn
money
are
made
to
pay
some
of
the
money
to
a
government


there
are
many
theories
of
how
to
organize
government
better


these
are
called
theories
of
civics


because
government
is
run
by
people
who
can
be
greedy
many
people
think
leaders
must
be
elected
by
some
kind
of
democracy


that
way
if
government
does
not
act
nice
they
can
be
replaced
in
the
next
election


still
many
countries
governments
are
not
a
democracy
but
other
forms
in
which
only
a
few
people
have
power


there
are
many
theories
of
how
to
run
a
government
better
and
keep
people
from
hurting
each
other


these
theories
are
part
of
politics


no
matter
how
a
government
is
chosen
it
must
do
politics
to
keep
power
