reasons
and
benefits
there
are
several
reasons
why
people
choose
to
be
vegetarians


some
think
it
is
wrong
or
cruel
to
eat
animals
since
animals
are
killed
and
often
feel
pain


other
people
may
feel
disgusted
to
eat
meat


a
third
reason
is
the
effect
on
the
environment


<collocation>producing meat</collocation>
especially
beef
uses
more
of
the
earth
land
and
water
than
eating
food
from
plants


people
may
have
more
than
different
reason
for
being
a
vegetarian
religious
and
spiritual
a
market
in
india
sells
tasty
ingredients
for
a
vegetarian
diet


most
vegetarians
in
the
world
are
hindu


hinduism
and
in
general
teach
vegetarianism
while
buddhism
may
or
may
not


without
any
specific
religion
some
people
in
the
western
world
also
follow
a
vegetarian
diet
because
it
may
deepen
inner
spiritual
connections
for
example
james
redfield


mahatma
gandhi
said
that
spiritual
experiences
are
greatly
enhanced
on
a
vegetarian
diet


hinduism
hindus
teach
vegetarianism
as
a
way
to
live
with
a
minimum
of
hurt
to
other
beings


in
today
world
about
twenty
percent
of
all
hindus
are
vegetarians


there
are
approximately
million
vegetarians
in
india
which
has
more
people
that
do
not
eat
meat
than
any
other
country


more
vegetarians
live
in
the
south
of
india
than
in
the
north
possibly
because
the
north
is
colder


for
yoga
and
meditation
it
is
wise
to
be
vegetarian


fact
date
september
the
hindu
who
believes
in
or
nonviolence
naturally
adopts
a
vegetarian
diet


it
is
a
matter
of
conscience
more
than
anything
else


the
vedic
and
scriptures
of
hinduism
explain
that
animals
have
souls
and
the
act
of
killing
animals
brings
bad
karma
because
the
killer
will
suffer
the
pain
of
the
animal
he
has
killed
in
this
life
or
the
next


adds
that
when
we
eat
meat
fish
fowl
and
eggs
we
absorb
the
vibration
of
the
creatures
into
our
nerves


this
promotes
fear
anger
jealousy
confusion
resentment
and
the
like


the
dharma
state
when
the
diet
is
pure
the
mind
and
heart
are
pure


generally
there
is
the
belief
based
on
scriptures
such
as
that
one
food
shapes
the
personality
mood
and
mind
