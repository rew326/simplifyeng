while
he
was
vice
president
he
went
to
the
soviet
union
and
had
a
debate
with
the
soviet
leader
khrushchev


they
were
both
arguing
that
their
country
was
better


in
the
<collocation>presidential election</collocation>
of
he
ran
against
democrat
john
kennedy


kennedy
was
expected
to
win
at
first
because
he
won
the
first
television
debate
against
nixon
but
as
election
day
came
closer
and
closer
nixon
was
catching
up


in
the
end
kennedy
won
but
it
was
a
very
close
election


in
nixon
lost
the
election
for
governor
of
california
to
pat
brown


after
losing
nixon
said
you
wo
have
dick
nixon
to
kick
around
anymore
leading
many
experts
to
say
that
nixon
political
career
was
over


in
richard
nixon
defeated
in
the
<collocation>presidential election</collocation>
and
became
president
of
the
united
states
in


presidency
nixon
took
over
the
vietnam
war
from
johnson
and
continued
it
with
the
strategy
of
slowly
withdrawing
troops
so
that
the
south
vietnamese
troops
could
take
over
the
fighting
by
themselves


nixon
secretly
bombed
many
enemy
targets
in
cambodia
and
north
vietnam
while
bringing
home
the
american
troops
to
make
it
easier
for
south
vietnam
to
win


when
his
spreading
the
bombing
to
cambodia
and
laos
became
known
in
it
caused
larger
protests
than
ever
in
america
including
at
kent
state
and
even
in
washington
dc
where
more
than
were
arrested
in
may
at
the
peak
of
the
protests


partly
because
of
the
amount
of
opposition
nixon
sped
up
<collocation>troop withdrawal</collocation>
and
ended
the
draft


nixon
was
very
successful
in
diplomacy
relations
negotiations
with
foreign
countries


he
began
a
policy
called
detente
which
reduced
tensions
between
the
united
states
and
the
soviet
union


the
two
countries
would
get
along
and
sign
treaties
that
would
limit
the
production
of
nuclear
weapons
between
both
sides


nixon
traveled
to
communist
china
and
established
a
very
good
relationship
with
them


before
that
there
was
almost
no
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
china


it
opened
up
the
door
for
decades
of
trade
in
the
future
which
is
why
many
items
in
the
united
states
were
made
in
china


his
diplomacy
with
china
is
seen
as
one
of
his
<collocation>greatest accomplishments</collocation>


later
under
president
carter
the
broke
relations
with
the
republic
of
china
and
recognized
communist
china
not
taiwan
as
the
legal
government
of
china


at
home
nixon
put
many
reforms
into
law


he
created
the
department
of
environmental
protection
supported
laws
supported
laws
and
supported
laws


when
inflation
meaning
the
value
of
money
goes
down
and
prices
go
up
was
high
he
ordered
that
prices
should
be
frozen
for
days


although
he
was
known
as
a
conservative
republican
before
he
became
president
while
he
was
president
he
supported
some
of
the
liberal
ideas
that
democrats
supported


in
nixon
made
a
speech
that
outlined
a
plan
for
universal
health
care


nixon
was
by
a
landslide
in
with
most
americans
approving
of
him
but
soon
after
nixon
reputation
would
be
destroyed
and
most
americans
would
disapprove
of
him


due
to
a
scandal
called
watergate
during
which
nixon
attempted
to
protect
or
possibly
ordered
men
to
burglarize
the
democratic
national
headquarters
congress
was
going
to
put
him
on
trial
in
a
process
called
impeachment
to
remove
him
from
power


nixon
tried
to
cover
up
the
scandal
but
eventually
the
<collocation>supreme court</collocation>
ordered
him
to
send
his
taped
conversations
which
included
him
talking
about
covering
up
watergate
to
them


alexander
thought
nixon
would
be
convicted
and
kicked
out
of
office


to
prevent
this
nixon
resigned
quit
the
presidency
in


nixon
second
vice
president
<collocation>gerald ford</collocation>
gave
nixon
a
pardon
of
any
crimes
nixon
committed
during
watergate


ford
wanted
to
end
the
crisis
as
quickly
as
possible
because
the
nation
faced
more
important
problems


many
people
blamed
ford
for
letting
nixon
go
unpunished
and
voted
against
him
when
he
ran
in
the
election


nixon
public
image
never
recovered
but
he
remained
as
a
consultant
to
later
presidents
and
to
other
people
in
government
and
the
media
especially
to
british
journalist
david
frost


his
memoirs
were
considered
important
reading


his
work
in
negotiating
with
china
in
the
early
was
praised
for
improving
relations
between
his
country
and
theirs


nixon
died
of
a
stroke
in
ten
months
after
his
wife
pat
died


the
house
where
he
was
born
is
now

known

in
ford
later
said
his
biological
father
had
a
history
of
hitting
his
mother


james
cannon
a
member
of
the
ford
administration
wrote
in
a
ford
biography
that
the
kings
separation
and
divorce
were
sparked
when
a
few
days
after
ford
birth
king
threatened
dorothy
with
a
butcher
knife
and
threatened
to
kill
her
ford
and
ford
nursemaid


ford
later
told
confidantes
that
his
father
had
first
hit
his
mother
on
their
honeymoon
for
smiling
at
another
man


after
two
and
a
half
years
with

a

ford


the
future
president

never
formally
adopted
however
and
he
did
not
legally
change
his
name
until
december
he
also
used
a
more
<collocation>conventional spelling</collocation>
of
his
middle
name


he
was
raised
in
<collocation>grand rapids</collocation>
with
his
three

ford
also
had
three
from
his
father
second
marriage
marjorie
king
henry
king
and
patricia
jane
king
born


they
never
saw
one
another
as
children
and
he
did
not
know
them
at
all


ford
was
not
aware
of
his
biological
father
until
he
was
when
his
parents
told
him
about
the
circumstances
of
his
birth


that
year
his
father
king
whom
ford
described
as
a
carefree
man
who
did
really
give
a
damn
about
the
hopes
and
dreams
of
his
firstborn
son
approached
ford
while
he
was
waiting
tables
in
a
<collocation>grand rapids</collocation>
restaurant


ford
maintained
his
distance
emotionally
saying
my
stepfather
was
a
magnificent
person
and
my
mother
equally
wonderful


so
i
could
have
written
a
better
prescription

political
career
ford
served
years
in
the
united

house
of
representatives
and
was
<collocation>minority leader</collocation>
for
many
years


when
richard
nixon
was
president
his
first
vice
president
was
spiro
but
resigned
in
because
he
took
bribes
while
he
was
governor
of
maryland
in
the
late


nixon
then
chose
ford
to
be
his
next
vice
president


ford
had
to
be
approved
by
congress
since
there
was
no
<collocation>presidential election</collocation>
that
year


because
he
had
been
in
congress
for
a
long
time
other
congressmen
knew
him
well
and
were
happy
to
approve
him
as
vice
president
because
they
thought
he
was
honest


however
ford
was
not
nixon
first
choice


some
of
his
first
choices
were
john
the
former
governor
of
texas
nelson
the
governor
of
<collocation>new york</collocation>
and
<collocation>ronald reagan</collocation>
the
former
governor
of
california


but
nixon
was
worried
that
these
other
men
might
have
trouble
getting
approved
by
congress


all
of
them
had
also
run
for
president
already
or
were
planning
to
run
soon


nixon
did
not
want
to
help
pick
who
would
be
the
top
republican
candidate
in
and
ford
promised
him
that
he
was
not
interested
in
being
president


ford
always
told
reporters
that
he
always
dreamed
of
being
speaker
of
the
house
instead


presidency
because
of
the
<collocation>watergate scandal</collocation>
nixon
resigned
on
august


ford
became
the
president


he
is
the
only
president
of
the
united
states
not
to
be
elected
to
either
the
office
of
president
or
vice
president


once
he
became
president
he
realized
he
could
do
a
good
job
and
decided
to
run
for
a
full
term
in


ford
had
pardoned
nixon
for
his
crimes
in


many
experts
say
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
ford
lost
to
jimmy
carter
in
the
election
which
was
very
close


other
reasons
for
the
loss
were
a
bad
economy
with
a
lot
of
inflation
the
incident
and
the
last
soldiers
leaving
vietnam
followed
by
saigon
and
the
rest
of
south

being
taken

the
ticket

the

one
of
the
reasons

part
of
the

system
these
target
specific
germs
or
poisons
using
their
antibodies


there
are
three
known
types
of
lymphocytes
called
and
natural
killer
cells
cells


make
antibodies
which
are
little
molecules
that
attach
to
viruses
or
bad
cells


these
tell
other
cells
to
destroy
the
viruses
or
bad
cells
like
a
flag


can
either
help
make
more
or
kill
cells
with
antibodies


natural
killer
cells
kill
cells
in
the
body
that
have
been
infected
by
a
virus
or
that
are
part
of
a
tumor


they
are
part
of
the
<collocation>innate immune</collocation>
system


are
reserve
cells
which
turn
into
and
cells
which
work
together
in
tissues
to
fight
disease


have
a
kidney
bean
shaped
center

lots
of
cytoplasm


they
may
appear
as
in

when
they
pass
through
tissue

eat
germs

cells

dead
cells


the
next
three
types
of
white
<collocation>blood cells</collocation>
are
referred
to
as
since
they
all
contain
rough
particles
that
assist
in
attacking
viruses
and
bacteria


are
also
called
leukocytes
because
of
the
shape
of
the
nucleus
which
has
three
segments


are
the
most
abundant
type
of
white
<collocation>blood cells</collocation>
in
mammals
of
leukocytes


they
are
an
essential
part
of
the
immune
system


they
get
to
the
site
of
an
injury
within
minutes
and
make
up
much
of
the
content
of
pus


they
have
a
short
of
a
couple
of
days


the
nucleus
which
looks
like
a
string
of
beads
does
not
take
up
stain
strongly


like
phagocytes
they
actually
eat
the
bacteria
and
dead
cells


they
also
release

proteins

do

how
they
work


they
are

of
the

components

<collocation>combat parasites</collocation>
and
certain
infections


as

are
round
cells
with

antigens
are
surface
molecules
on
a
cell


once

the
cells
respond
to
remove
pathogens

cells


b
cells
respond
to
pathogens
by
producing
large
numbers
of
antibodies
which
then
destroy
foreign
objects

cells
produce

signal
to
other
immune
