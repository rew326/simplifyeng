henry
june
january
was
the
king
of
england
from
until
his
death


he
is
perhaps
one
of
england
most
famous
of
monarchs
because
he
split
from
the
roman
catholic
church
and
the
pope
and
he
married
six
times


henry
was
born
in
greenwich
palace
on
june
and
was
the
second
son
of
henry
of
england
and
elizabeth
of
york


he
had
an
elder
brother
who
was
called
arthur
prince
of
wales
and
two
sisters
who
were
called
margaret
and
mary


arthur
should
have
been
king
after
their
father
died
but
arthur
died
before
his
father
making
henry
next
in
line
for
the
throne


henry
ended
up
marrying
arthur
widow
catherine
of


he
is
as
a
talented
composer
and
author


fundamentally
however
king
henry
was
famously
unpredictable
and
temperamental
with
many
of
his
subjects
executed
under
his
orders
including
two
of
his
own
wives


his
physical
decline
dominated
his
later
reign
and
he
became
hugely
obese


as
he
lay
dying
in
henry
last
words
are
reported
to
have
been
<collocation>monks monks</collocation>
monks
with
certain
historians
believing
it
as
a
reference
to
the
monks
he
evicted
during
the
dissolution
of
the
monasteries


he
died
at
the
age
of
in
on
the
day
which
would
have
been
his
father
king
henry
birthday


early
life
henry
was
born
in
greenwich


his
father
and
mother
henry
and
elizabeth
of
york
saw
little
of
their
children


henry
was
their
second
son


he
had
his
own
servants
and
minstrels
and
a
fool
named
john
goose


he
even
had
a
<collocation>whipping boy</collocation>
who
was
punished
for
henry
when
he
did
something
wrong


prince
henry
enjoyed
music
and
was
very
good
at
it


at
the
age
of
he
could
play
many
instruments
including
the
fife
harp
viola
and
drums


henry
was
also
a
scholar
linguist
musician
and
athlete
at
his
early
age


he
could
speak
fluent
latin
french
and
spanish


he
got
tutored
by
the
best
tutors
and
he
also
had
to
learn
jousting
archery
hunting
and
other
military
arts


henry
was
very
religious


henry
older
brother
was
called
arthur


arthur
married
a
spanish
princess
catalina
de
when
he
was
fifteen


prince
arthur
died
within
a
few
months
of
his
wedding
of
tuberculosis
at
the
age
of
but
some
say
he
died
of
plague
or
sweating
sickness


after
his
brother
died
henry
bonded
closely
with
catalina
de
catherine
of


later
on
they
<collocation>got married</collocation>


the
couple
had
trouble
getting
married
because
in
leviticus
if
a
brother
is
to
marry
the
wife
of
a
brother
they
will
remain
childless


that
meant
that
catherine
had
to
swear
that
her
marriage
with
arthur
had
not
been
perfect


young
henry
was
now
the
heir
to
the
throne


while
his
father
was
alive
he
was
watched
so
closely
because
the
king
feared
for
the
safety
of
his
only
remaining
male
heir


henry
could
go
out
only
through
a
private
door
and
then
he
was
watched
by
specially
appointed
people


no
one
could
speak
to
henry


he
spent
most
of
his
time
in
his
room
which
could
only
be
entered
through
his
father
bedroom


henry
never
spoke
in
public
unless
it
was
to
answer
a
question
from
his
father


he
kept
his
<collocation>enthusiastic personality</collocation>
under
control
on
public
occasions
because
he
feared
his
father
temper


he
was
given
little
training
for
his
future
role
as
king
by
his
father
and
relied
heavily
on
his
counselors
in
the
early
years
of
his
reign


in
henry
died
of
tuberculosis
as
well
and
his
son
became
king
henry


he
was
when
he
was
crowned
king
and
catherine
was
crowned
queen
consort


reign
the
most
important
event
that
happened
in
england
when
henry
was
the
king
was
the
country
change
in
religion


as
his
first
wife
catherine
of
had
only
had
one
daughter
and
they
did
not
have
any
sons
to
be
his
heirs
henry
asked
the
pope
to
give
them
a
divorce


the
pope
would
not
do
this


catherine
nephew
was
charles
v
emperor
of
the
holy
roman
empire
and
he
was
very
powerful


also
catherine
family
ruled
spain
which
was
the
largest
catholic
country


henry
then
chose
a
new
archbishop
of
canterbury
a
man
called
thomas


henry
knew
that
would
do
what
he
wanted
and
agreed
that
henry
could
have
a
divorce
from
catherine


the
pope
was
so
angry
that
he
excommunicated
henry
meaning
henry
was
thrown
out
of
the
church


henry
fought
back


in
he
passed
the
act
of
supremacy
which
meant
that
the
king
not
the
pope
was
the
head
of
the
church
in
england


he
then
forced
all
priests
and
bishops
to
accept
him
as
the
new
leader


anyone
who
refused
was
punished


henry
spent
a
lot
of
time
at
a
magnificent
building
named
court
that
belonged
to
his
friend
cardinal


he
spent
the
equivalent
of
million
renovating
the
court
and
building
things
such
as
tennis
courts
and
jousting
yards


however
cardinal
failed
to
get
an
for
henry
when
he
wished
to
divorce
catherine
of


many
people
think
that
this
is
the
reason
why
henry
sacked
cardinal
and
took
court
from
him


protestants
thought
that
monasteries
in
which
roman
catholic
monks
and
nuns
lived
had
more
money
and
land
than
the
monks
and
nuns
needed


henry
forced
the
monks
and
nuns
to
move
out
of
the
monasteries


then
henry
gave
their
money
and
land
to
men
who
supported
him


most
of
the
men
who
received
money
and
land
from
the
closed
monasteries
were
protestants


this
event
was
called
the
dissolution
of
the
monasteries


after
his
divorce
from
catherine
of
henry
married
anne
who
was
younger
than
catherine
and
still
able
to
have
children


when
anne
just
like
catherine
only
had
a
daughter
and
no
sons
henry
blamed
her
for
treason
and
had
her
beheaded
by
a
french
swordsman


he
then
started
looking
for
another
wife


henry
most
loyal
official
thomas
cromwell
helped
him
to
find
a
way
to
get
rid
of
anne
by
finding
people
who
said
that
she
had
been
the
lover
of
several
other
men


anne
was
put
on
trial
and
found
guilty
and
she
was
executed
by
having
her
head
chopped
off


henry
third
wife
was
jane


she
soon
gave
birth
to
a
son
called
edward


although
this
made
henry
very
happy
a
few
days
later
jane
died


henry
had
loved
her
very
much
and
he
never
got
over
his
sadness
at
her
death


he
lost
interest
in
everything
and
became
bigger
in
size


he
became
angry
with
thomas
cromwell
when
cromwell
suggested
that
he
should
get
married
again
after
jane
death


after
a
while
henry
changed
his
mind


as
he
still
only
had
one
son
he
realized
that
it
might
be
a
<collocation>good idea</collocation>
to
marry
again
and
he
agreed
to
marry
anne
of
a
german
princess


when
anne
arrived
henry
did
not
think
she
was
as
pretty
as
she
looked
in
the
pictures
he
had
seen
and
he
was
not
satisfied
with
her


anne
was
also
unhappy
and
agreed
to
be
divorced
from
henry
after
only
a
few
months


in
the
meantime
henry
had
noticed
a
young
lady
at
court
called
catherine
and
thought
that
she
might
make
a
good
wife


catherine
was
a
cousin
of
henry
second
wife
anne


henry
and
catherine
<collocation>got married</collocation>
in
but
catherine
was
much
younger
than
henry
and
she
soon
got
tired
of
him
and
started
to
flirt
with
other
men


after
they
had
been
married
for
just
over
a
year
henry
found
out
that
catherine
had
been
having
an
affair
with
someone
else


she
was
found
guilty
of
treason
and
was
executed
just
like
anne
had
been
a
few
years
before


henry
sixth
and
last
wife
was
called
<collocation>catherine parr</collocation>


she
was
a
woman
in
her
thirties
who
had
already
been
married
twice


her
first
two
husbands
had
been
much
older
than
she
was
and
both
had
died


henry
thought
that
she
would
be
more
sensible
and
faithful
than
his
other
wives
and
he
turned
out
to
be
right


<collocation>catherine parr</collocation>
stayed
married
to
henry
for
over
three
years
until
he
died
but
they
did
not
have
any
children


in
an
event
named
the
field
of
the
cloth
of
gold
took
place
in
calais
which
belonged
to
britain
rather
than
france
at
the
time


it
was
organised
by
britain
and
therefore
henry
to
celebrate
peace
france
and
england
because
they
had
been
at
war
for
a
long
time


music
dancing
food
wine
and
culture
dominated
the
event
and
millions
of
pounds
was
spent
on
the
event
in
modern
day
money


it
is
clear
that
no
was
spared


the
event
lasted
for
two
and
a
half
weeks


henry
famously
wrestled
king
francis
i
of
france
and
lost


after
divorcing
catherine
of
henry
began
to
suffer
many
different
ailments
he
never
again
regained
health


he
died
on
january
and
was
buried
in
<collocation>windsor castle</collocation>


henry
was
the
father
of
two
queens
and
one
king


they
were
mary
i
of
england
elizabeth
i
of
england
and
edward
vi
of
england


none
of
them
had
any
children
of
their
own


henry
often
liked
to
be
captured
in
his
portraits
with
either
food
or
pets


he
had
many
pets


henry
was
often
seen
with
his
dog


he
owned
a
<collocation>white pug</collocation>
and
was
very
aware
of
how
much
his
dog
represented
him
as
a
rich
wealthy
man


in
the
act
of
union
was
passed
under
henry
rule
which
had
a
long
lasting
effect
on
wales
as
a
nation


the
act
of
union
meant
that
welsh
people
were
forced
to
speak
english
and
things
such
as
road
signs
were
translated
in
to
english


the
royal
family
who
were
based
in
london
were
now
officially
in
charge
of
wales


however
the
act
also
meant
that
welsh
citizens
were
given
the
same
legal
rights
as
the
english
so
there
was
an
up
side
to
this
new
law

the

back
according
to

german
layout
an
orchestra
is
a
group
of
musicians
playing
instruments
together


they
usually
play
classical
music


a
large
orchestra
is
sometimes
called
a
<collocation>symphony orchestra</collocation>
and
a
small
orchestra
is
called
a
chamber
orchestra


a
<collocation>symphony orchestra</collocation>
may
have
about
players
while
a
chamber
orchestra
may
have
or
players


the
number
of
players
will
depend
on
what
music
they
are
playing
and
the
size
of
the
place
where
they
are
playing


the
word
orchestra
originally
meant
the
space
in
front
of
a
stage
in
a
greek
theater
which
is
where
the
singers
and
instruments
used
to
play


gradually
the
word
came
to
mean
the
musicians
themselves

the

the

is
directed
by
a
conductor


helps
the
players
to
play
together
to
get
the
right
balance
so
that
everything
can
be
heard
clearly
and
to
encourage
the
orchestra
to
play
with
the
same
kind
of
feeling


some
small
<collocation>chamber orchestras</collocation>
may
play
without
a
conductor


this
was
usual
until
the
century
when
the
orchestras
got
very
big
and
needed
a
conductor
who
made
decisions
and
stood
in
front
so
that
all
the
players
could
see
him


the
instruments
an
orchestral
layout


there
are
various
ways
of
positioning
instruments


quite
often
the
woodwind
are
in
straight
lines
instead
of
a
curve
as
in
this
diagram
and
the
extra
woodwind
more
often
sit
with
the
others
the
piccolo
with
the
flutes


the
instruments
of
the
orchestra
are
divided
into
districts
the
strings
woodwind
brass
and
percussion


each
section
group
of
instruments
will
have
a
player
who
is
the
boss


if
the
music
says
kiss
in
their
part
it
is
the
boss
who
will
kiss


the
principals
will
make
decisions
about
seating
arrangements
and
about
technical
ways
of
playing
the
music
for
example
the
principal
of
the
string
sections
will
make
sure
all
the
players
move
their
bows
up
and
down
in
the
same
direction


the
violins
are
divided
into
first
and
second
violins


the
first
violins
usually
have
the
tune
while
the
seconds
most
of
the
time
are
part
of
the
accompaniment


the
principal
of
the
first
violins
is
the
leader
or
of
the
orchestra


in
a
professional
orchestra
they
will
be
the
most
highly
paid
member
of
the
orchestra
the
string
family
the
strings
are
the

only
five
kinds
of
instruments
violin
viola
cello
double
bass
and
harp


this
is
because
they
are
playing
most
of
the
time
and
usually
form
the
basis
of
the
music


if
they
are
not
playing
the
tune
they
will
probably
be
accompanying


the
first
and
second
violins
play
different
notes
the
firsts
usually
have
the
tune


the
strings
sit
at
the
front
of
the
stage
in
a
fan
shape
in
front
of
the
conductor


the
first
violins
are
on
the
conductor
left
then
come
the
second
violins
then
the
violas
and
then
the


the
double
basses
are
behind
the


some
conductors
prefer
to
have
the
second
violins
on
their
right
and
the
between
the
first
violins
and
violas
see
image
of
the
orchestra


the
woodwind
family
the
woodwind
sit
in
one
or
two
rows
depending
on
the
size
of
the
orchestra
behind
the
strings


there
are
five
main
woodwind
instruments
flute
oboe
clarinet
saxophone
and
bassoon


each
of
these
two
instruments
also
come
in
different
versions
the
flute
has
a
small
version
called
the
piccolo
which
plays
an
<collocation>octave higher</collocation>


it
is
the
highest
instrument
in
the
orchestra


occasionally
there
is
an
alto
flute
which
is
longer
and
plays
a
fifth
half
an
octave
lower
than
the
flute


most
woodwind
instruments
need
a
reed
but
the
flute
does
not
have
a
reed


the
bassoon
has
a
larger
version
the
or
double
bassoon
which
sounds
an
octave
lower


it
is
the
lowest
instrument
in
the
orchestra


a
formal
orchestra
will
always
consist
of
two
of
the
four
main
instruments


the
variations
of
the
instruments
are
used
where
the
piece
asks
for
it


usually
the
newer
pieces
written
after
will
have
more
instruments


sometimes
a
player
will
double
on
these
extra
instruments
for
example
one
of
the
flute
players
may
also
play
the
piccolo
in
the
same
piece


it
depends
on
the
piece
of
music


obviously
a
player
can
not
play
the
flute
and
piccolo
at
the
same
time


if
the
two
instruments
do
play
at
the
same
time
an
extra
player
will
be
needed
for
the
piccolo


the
brass
family
the
brass
section
has
four
sections
trumpet
trombone
french
horn
and
tuba


some
of
these
come
in
several
sizes


the
article
on
instruments
explains
more
about
it


the
trumpet
may
have
several
slightly
different
sizes


the
lowest
kind
is
a
<collocation>bass trumpet</collocation>


the
trombone
may
be
an
alto
tenor
bass
or
trombone


the
french
horn
like
the
other
brass
instruments
has
changed
over
the
years


modern
horns
have
at
least
three
valves
and
are
usually
in
f


they
often
sit
in
a
different
place
to
the
other
brass


the
tuba
comes
in
different
sizes
and
the
player
or
conductor
must
decide
which
to
use
for
the
piece
they
are
playing


there
are
large
ones
called
tubas


a
small
tuba
is
commonly
also
seen
and
is
called
a
or
a
<collocation>baritone horn</collocation>


the
percussion
family
the
percussion
section
has
the
largest
variety
of
instruments
but
in
an
orchestra
they
will
have
the
smallest
number
of
players


this
is
because
they
are
mostly
loud
and
can
be
heard
easily
over
the
rest
of
the
orchestra


the
timpani
or
kettle
drums
can
be
tuned
to
particular
notes


they
are
the
most
common
percussion
instrument


composers
such
as
haydn
and
mozart
nearly
always
used
them
even
with
their
small
orchestras


this
is
the
most
commonly
used
<collocation>percussion instruments</collocation>
and
is
used
in
almost
all
pieces


the
rest
of
the
percussion
section
can
include
tuned
<collocation>percussion instruments</collocation>
like
the
xylophone


percussion
can
be
other
kinds
of
drum
like
bass
drum
snare
drum
and
a
variety
of
others
cymbal
to
name
the
most
common
ones


in
an
orchestral
work
there
can
be
many
<collocation>percussion instruments</collocation>
but
a
few
players


the
principal
percussion
player
will
have
to
decide
which
player
will
play
which
instrument


the
percussionists
have
to
work
well
together
as
a
team
so
all
parts
can
be
covered


the
piano
and
<collocation>pipe organ</collocation>
are
also
used
in
an
orchestra


the
history
of
the
orchestra
it
is
difficult
to
say
when
the
orchestra
was
invented
because
instruments
have
played
together
for
many
centuries


if
we
say
that
an
orchestra
is
a
group
of
string
instruments
with
several
players
playing
the
same
part
and
that
there
may
be
<collocation>wind instruments</collocation>
woodwind
and
brass
or
percussion
playing
as
well
then
the
century
is
the
time
that
orchestras
started


in
paris
in
king
louis
had
an
orchestra
of
violins
called
du


later
in
the
century
the
english
king
charles
ii
wanted
to
be
like
the
french
king
and
so
he
too
had
a
string
orchestra


gradually
the
other
instruments
were
added


at
this
time
there
was
usually
someone
playing
the
harpsichord
the
part


it
was
often
the
composer
himself
who
would
have
conducted
from
the
keyboard
at
important
moments
like
the
beginning
and
end
of
the
piece


clarinets
came
into
the
orchestra
at
the
end
of
the
century
and
trombones
at
the
beginning
of
the
century


orchestras
were
still
quite
small
though


the
saxophone
was
invented
in
the
middle
of
the
century
but
although
they
started
to
use
it
in
orchestras
it
soon
became
an
instrument
that
was
used
in
wind
bands
and
later
jazz
bands


the
opera
composer
richard
wagner
made
the
orchestra
much
bigger
because
he
kept
asking
for
extra
instruments
