from
one
point
of
view
humans
are
a
prime
example
of
nature
and
are
the
most
widely
studied
natural
inhabitants
of
the
planet
earth


humans
interact
with
each
other
in
their
natural
environment
on
a
constant
basis


every
part
of
nature
everything
from
the
air
to
the

is
interdependent

humans

and

from
another
point
of
view
humans
and
nature
can
be
said
to
be
in
conflict


nature
is
often
seen
by
humans
as
natural
resources


people
cut
down
trees
to
get
wood
to
burn
to
build
houses
or
to
make
a
place
to
grow
food


fires
cars
and
factories
make
a
lot
of
smoke
and
harm
many
places


people
who
like
to
leave
<collocation>nature unharmed</collocation>
and
those
who
feel
they
need
to
use
more
of
nature
often
fight
about
what
they
should
do


in
the
modern
world
with
many
more
people
and
many
big
cities
these
problems
are
becoming
more
serious


nature
in
the
<collocation>broadest sense</collocation>
means
the
physical
world
as
a
whole


this
is
the
meaning
that
physics
the
study
of
nature
etymologically
takes


natural
a
useful
definition
of
natural
is
happening
or
operating
in
accordance
with
the
ordinary
course
of

a
natural
resource
is
anything
that
people
can
use
which
comes
from
nature


people
do
not
make
natural
resources
but
gather
them
from
the
earth


examples
of
natural
resources
are
air
water
wood
oil
wind

supply
we
often
say
there
are
two
sorts
of
natural
resources
<collocation>renewable resources</collocation>
and
resources


a
<collocation>renewable resource</collocation>
grows
again
and
comes
back
again
after
we
use
it


for
example
soil
sunlight
water
and
wood
are
<collocation>renewable resources</collocation>


a
resource
is
a
resource
that
does
not
grow
and
come
back
or
a
resource
that
would
take
a
very
long
time
to
come
back


for
example
coal
is
a
resource


when
we
use
coal
there
is
less
coal
afterward


one
day
there
will
be
no
more
of
it
to
make
goods


the
resource
can
be
used
directly
for
example
burning
oil
to
cook
or
we
can
find
a
<collocation>renewable resource</collocation>
to
use
for
example
using
wind
energy
to
make
electricity
to
cook


it
is
important
to
conserve
save
resources
because
if
we
use
them
too
quickly
there
will
not
be
enough


most
natural
resources
are
limited


this
means
they
will
eventually
run
out


a
perpetual
resource
has
a
supply


some
examples
of
<collocation>perpetual resources</collocation>
include
solar
energy
tidal
energy
and
wind
energy


other
examples
are
salt
stone
magnesium
and
diamonds


some
of
the
things
influencing
supply
of
resources
include
whether
it
is
able
to
be
recycled
and
the
availability
of
<collocation>suitable substitutes</collocation>
for
the
material


resources
can
not
be
recycled


for
example
oil
minerals
and
other
resources
can
not
be
recycled


demand
the
demand
for
resources
can
change
with
new
technology
new
needs
and
new
economics
changes
in
cost
of
the
resources


some
material
can
go
completely
out
of
use
if
people
do
not
want
it
any
more


demand
of
natural
resources
is
very
high
but
availability
is
very
low


availability
all
places
have
their
own
natural
resources


when
people
do
not
have
a
certain
resource
they
need
they
can
either
replace
it
with
another
resource
or
trade
with
another
country
to
get
the
resource


some
resources
are
difficult
to
find
so
people
sometimes
fight
to
have
them
for
example
oil
resources


when
people
do
not
have
some
natural
resources
their
quality
of
life
can
get
lower


so
we
need
to
protect
our
resources
from
pollution


for
example
when
they
can
not
get
clean
water
people
may
become
ill
if
there
is
not
enough
wood
trees
will
be
cut
and
the
forest
will
disappear
over
time
deforestation
if
there
are
not
enough
fish
in
a
sea
people
can
die
of
starvation


some
examples
of
<collocation>renewable resources</collocation>
are
wood
solar
energy
trees
wind
hydroelectric
power
fish
and
sunlight


so
humans
should
begin
saving
their
natural
resources


or
else
all
will
be
lost
and
it
will
be
difficult
for
humans
to
survive

this
makes
it
very
hard
to
talk
about
ideas
of

the

because
it

based
on
several
different

of
entropy
also
would
mean
several
different
things


cliff
proposed
a
list
of
ways
to
find
entropy
in
ways
other
than
measuring
heat
as
given
off
by
a
body


since
it
is
living
things
looking
for
these
ways
however
and
since
they
create
models
that
are
in
more
order
than
the
measurements
they
combine
thinking
and
science
are
also
just
a
part
of

the
idea
that
living

the

is
called
the
anthropic
principle


it
has
a
strong
form
which
says
that
we
are
needed
to
do
this


and
a
weak
or
obvious
form
which
says
if
we
were
not
here
asking
it
would
not
matter


cosmology
is
concerned
with
this
and
other
issues
of
where
life
fits
into
models
of
our
universe


is
not
the
only
idea
about
life
and
how
it
affects
our
view
of
time


most
of
engineering
relies
on
linear
time
for
risk
analysis
economics
on
cyclic
time
like
the
business
cycle
and
biology
explores
rhythmic
time
especially
in
systems
of

probably
all
of
these
ideas
are
useful
for
something

the

neptune
was
discovered
by
the
astronomers
le
and
john
<collocation>couch adams</collocation>


they
were
both
honored
for
the
discovery


the
planet
was
the
first
to
be
discovered
by
mathematical
calculations
instead
of
using
a
telescope


because
of
uranus
<collocation>odd movements</collocation>
in
its
orbit
the
line
which
a
planet
follows
in
moving
it
made
astronomers
search

the
planet
was
visited
by
only
one
spacecraft

on
august


neptune
once
had
a
huge
storm
known
as
the
great
dark

which
was
discovered
in
by
voyager


however
the
dark
spot
was
not
seen
in
and
new
spots
were
found
since
then


it
is
not
known
why
the
dark
spot
disappeared


however
nasa
suggested
for
a
future
spacecraft
to
orbit
and
learn
more
about
neptune


the
spacecraft
was
to
be
shared
between
the

history
discovery
le
the
of
neptune


the
first
possible
sighting
of
neptune
is
thought
to
be
by
galileo
as
his
drawings
showed
neptune
near
jupiter


but
galileo
was
not
credited
for
the
discovery
since
he
thought
neptune
was
a
fixed
star
instead
of
a
planet


because
of
neptune
slow
movement
across
the
sky
galileo
small
telescope
was
not
strong
enough
to
detect
neptune
as
a
planet


in
published
the
astronomical
tables
of
the
orbit
of
uranus


later
observations
showed
that
uranus
was
moving
in
an
irregular
way
in
its
orbit
making
some
astronomers
think
of
another
large
body
being
the
cause
of
the
<collocation>irregular motions</collocation>
of
uranus


in
john
<collocation>couch adams</collocation>
calculated
the
orbit
of
an
eighth
planet
that
would
possibly
be
influencing
the
orbit
of
uranus


he
sent
his
calculations
to
sir
george
airy
the
<collocation>astronomer royal</collocation>
who
asked
adams
for
an
explanation


adams
began
to
make
a
copy
of
the
reply
but
never
sent
it


in
le
who
was
not
working
with
adams
created
his
own
calculations
but
also
had
problems
in
encouraging
any
interest
with
his
people


however
in
the
same
year
john
herschel
began
to
support
the
mathematical
method
and
encouraged
james
challis
to
search
for
the
planet


after
much
delays
challis
began
his
<collocation>unwilling search</collocation>
in
july


meanwhile
le
had
convinced
to
search
for
the
planet


although
was
still
a
student
at
the
berlin
observatory
he
suggested
that
a
newly
drawn
map
of
the
sky
in
the
region
of
le
predicted
area
could
be
compared
with
the
current
sky
to
look
for
the
displacement
characteristic
of
a
planet
as
compared
to
a
fixed
star


neptune
was
then
discovered
that
very
night
on
september
within
of
where
le
had
predicted
it
to
be
and
about
from
adams
prediction


challis
later
found
out
that
he
had
seen
the
planet
twice
in
august
failing
to
recognize
it
owing
to
his
careless
approach
to
the
work


after
the
news
of
the
discovery
of
neptune
spread
there
was
also
a
lot
of
arguing
between
the
french
and
the
british
about
who
was
to
be
deserved
credit
for
the
discovery


later
an
international
agreement
decided
that
both
le
and
adams
together
deserved
credit


however
historians
are
now
reviewing
the
topic
after
the
rediscovery
in
of
the
neptune
papers
historical
documents
from
the
royal
<collocation>greenwich observatory</collocation>
which
had
seemingly
been
stolen
by
astronomer
for
nearly
three
decades
and
were
only
rediscovered
in
his
ownership
right
after
his
death


after
reviewing
the
documents
some
historians
now
think
that
adams
does
not
deserve
equal
credit
with
le


naming
shortly
after
its
discovery
neptune
was
temporarily
called
the
<collocation>planet exterior</collocation>
to
uranus
or
le
planet


the
first
suggestion
for
a
name
came
from


he
proposed
the
name
janus


in
england
challis
suggested
the
name


in
france
suggested
that
the
new
planet
be
called
a
suggestion
which
was
met
with
a
lot
of
opposition
outside
france


french
almanacs
promptly
reintroduced
the
name
herschel
for
uranus
and
for
the
new
planet


meanwhile
on
separate
and
different
reason
adams
suggested
changing
the
name
georgian
to
uranus
while
through
the
board
of
longitude
suggested
neptune
for
the
new
planet


gave
support
of
that
name
on
december
to
the
saint
petersburg
academy
of
sciences


soon
neptune
was
internationally
agreed
among
many
people
and
was
then
the
official
name
for
the
new
planet


in
roman
mythology
neptune
was
the
god
of
the
sea
identified
with
the
greek
god
poseidon


structure

and
composition
at
e
kg
neptune

puts
the
planet
between
earth
and
the
largest
<collocation>gas giants</collocation>
neptune
has
seventeen
earth
masses
but
just
the
mass
of
jupiter


neptune
and
uranus
are
often
considered
to
be
part
of
a
of
<collocation>gas giant</collocation>
known
as
ice
giants
given
their
smaller
size
and
big
differences
in
composition
compared
to
jupiter
and
saturn


in
the
search
for
planets
neptune
has
been
used
as
a
reference
to
determine
the
size
and
structure
of
the
discovered
planet


some
discovered
planets
that
have
similar
masses
like
neptune
are
often
called


just
as
astronomers
refer
to
various


the
atmosphere
of
neptune
is
made
up
mostly
of
hydrogen
with
a
smaller
amount
of
helium


a
tiny
amount
of
methane
is
also
detected
in
the
atmosphere


important
<collocation>absorption bands</collocation>
of
methane
happen
at
wavelengths
above
nm
in
the
red
and
infrared
portion
of
the
spectrum


this
absorption
of
red
light
by
the
atmospheric
methane
gives
neptune
its
<collocation>blue hue</collocation>


because
neptune
orbits
so
far
from
the
sun
it
gets
very
little
heat
with
the
<collocation>uppermost regions</collocation>
of
the
atmosphere
at
c
k


deeper
inside
the
layers
of
gas
however
the
temperature
rises
slowly


like
uranus
the
source
of
this
heating
is
unknown
but
the
differences
are
larger
neptune
is
the
farthest
planet
from
the
sun
yet
its
internal
energy
is
strong
enough
to
create
the
fastest
winds
seen
in
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>


several
possible
explanations
have
been
suggested
including
heating
from
the
planet
core
the
continued
radiation
into
space
of
leftover
heat
made
by
matter
during
the
planet
birth
and
gravity
waves
breaking
above
the
tropopause


the
structure
of
the
inside
of
neptune
is
thought
to
be
very
similar
to
the
structure
of
the
inside
of
uranus


there
is
likely
to
be
a
core
thought
to
be
about
earth
masses
made
up
of
molten
rock
and
metal
surrounded
by
a
mixture
of
rock
water
ammonia
and
methane


the
heavy
pressures
keep
the
icy
part
of
this
surrounding
mixture
as
solids
in
spite
of
the
large
temperatures
near
the
core


the
atmosphere
extending
about
to
of
the
way
towards
the
center
is
mostly
hydrogen
and
helium
at
high
altitudes


more
mixtures
of
methane
ammonia
and
water
are
found
in
the
lower
areas
of
the
atmosphere


very
slowly
this
darker
and
hotter
area
blends
into
the
<collocation>superheated liquid</collocation>
interior


the
pressure
at
the
center
of
neptune
is
millions
of
times
more
than
that
on
the
surface
of
earth


comparing
its
rotational
speed
to
its
degree
of
shows
that
it
has
its
mass
less
concentrated
towards
the
center
unlike
uranus

thought
to

red
spot
of
jupiter


however
on
november
the
<collocation>hubble space</collocation>
telescope
did
not
see
the
great
dark
spot
on
the
planet


instead
a
new
storm
similar
to
the
great
dark
spot
was
found
in
the
planet
northern
hemisphere


the
reason
why
the
great
dark
spot
has
disappeared
is
unknown


one
possible
theory
is
that
heat
transfer
from
the
planet
core
disrupted
the
atmospheric
balance
and
existing
<collocation>circulation patterns</collocation>


the
scooter
is
another
storm
a
white
cloud
group
farther
south
than
the
great
dark
spot


its
nickname
was
given
when
it
was
first
noticed
in
the
months
leading
up
to
the
<collocation>voyager encounter</collocation>
in
it
moved
faster
than
the
great
dark
spot


later
images
showed
clouds
that
moved
even
faster
than
scooter


the
wizard
eye
dark
spot
is
another
southern
storm
the
second
most
strongest
storm
seen
during
the
encounter


it
originally
was
completely
dark
but
as
voyager
came
closer
to
the
planet
a
bright
core
developed
and
is
seen
in
most
of
the
highest
resolution
images


unlike
other
<collocation>gas giants</collocation>
neptune
atmosphere
shows
the
presence
of
high
clouds
making
shadows
on
a
thick
<collocation>cloud deck</collocation>
below


though
neptune
atmosphere
is
much
more
active
than
that
of
uranus
both
planets
are
made
up
of
the
same
gases
and
ices


uranus
and
neptune
are
not
exactly
the
same
type
of
<collocation>gas giants</collocation>
like
to
jupiter
and
saturn
but
are
rather
ice
giants
meaning
they
have
a
larger
solid
core
and
are
also
made
of
ices


neptune
is
very
cold
with
temperatures
as
low
as
c
f
or
k
recorded
at
the
<collocation>cloud tops</collocation>
in


neptune
also
has
similarities
with
uranus
in
its
magnetosphere
with
a
magnetic
field
strongly
tilted
comparative
to
its
<collocation>rotational axis</collocation>
at
and
offset
at
least
radii
about
kilometres
from
the
planet
physical
center


comparing
the
<collocation>magnetic fields</collocation>
of
the
two
planets
scientists
think
the
extreme
course
may
be
characteristic
of
flows
in
the
interior
of
the
planet
and
not
the
result
of
uranus
sideways
rotational
movement

neptune
rings
rings
of
neptune
neptune
rings
very
small
blue
colored
rings
have
been
discovered
around
the
blue
planet
but
they
are
not
as
well
known
as
the
rings
of
saturn


when
these
rings
were
discovered
by
a
team
led
by
edward
originally
they
thought
that
the
rings
may
not
be
complete
rings


however
this
was
proven
wrong
by
voyager


neptune
planetary
rings
have
a
weird
clumpy
arrangement


although
the
cause
is
currently
unknown
but
some
scientists
think
that
it
may
be
because
of
the
gravitational
contact
with
small
moons
that
orbit
near
them

proof
that
the
rings
are
incomplete
first
began
in
the
when
stellar
were
found
to
rarely
show
an
extra
blink
just
before
or
after
the
planet
the
star


pictures
from
voyager
in
solved
the
problem
when
the
ring
system
was
found
to
have
several
faint
rings


the
farthest
ring
adams
has
three
famous
arcs
now
named
and
liberty
equality
and
fraternity


the
existence
of
arcs
is
very
hard
to
understand
because
the
laws
of
motion
would
predict
that
arcs
spread
out
into
a
single
ring
in
a
very
short
time


the
gravitational
effects
of
galatea
a
moon
just
inward
from
the
ring
are
now
thought
to
have
created
the
arcs


several
other
rings
were
discovered
by
the
voyager
cameras


also
with
the
thin
adams
ring
about
km
from
the
center
of
neptune
the
ring
is
at
km
and
the
wider
smaller
ring
is
at
km


a
very
small
<collocation>outward expansion</collocation>
to
the
ring
has
been
named
it
is
surrounded
at
its
outer
edge
by
the
ring
at
km


new
observations
published
in
appeared
to
show
that
neptune
rings
are
a
lot
more
unstable
than
thought
before


to
be
exact
it
looks
like
that
the
ring
might
disappear
maybe
quickly
in
less
than
years


the
new
observations
seems
to
puzzle
our
understanding
of
neptune
rings
into
a
lot
of
confusion


neptune
moons
list
of
neptune
moons
neptune
has
a
total
of
known
moons


as
neptune
was
the
roman
god
of
the
sea
the
planet
moons
were
named
after
lesser
sea
gods
or
goddesses


the
largest
and
the
only
one
big
enough
to
have
the
shape
of
a
sphere
is
triton
pronounced
discovered
by
william
just
days
after
the
discovery
of
neptune
itself


unlike
all
other
large
planetary
moons
triton
has
a
retrograde
orbit
showing
that
the
moon
was
probably
captured
and
maybe
was
once
a
belt
object


it
is
close
enough
to
neptune
to
be
locked
into
a
<collocation>synchronous orbit</collocation>
and
is
slowly
moving
into
neptune
and
will
one
day
be
torn
apart
when
it
passes
the
<collocation>roche limit</collocation>


triton
is
the
coldest
object
that
has
been
measured
in
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
with
temperatures
of
c
k
f


its
is
km
of
earth
moon
luna
its
mass
is
kg
of
luna
its
orbital
diameter
is
km
of
luna
and
its
orbital
period
is
days
of
luna


neptune
second
known
moon
by
order
of
distance
the
odd
moon
has
one
of
the
most
unusual
orbits
of
any
satellite
in
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>


from
july
to
september
voyager
discovered
six
new
moons
of
neptune


of
these
the
proteus
is
the
biggest
known
object
that
has
not
been
shaped
into
a
sphere
by
its
own
gravity


although
it
is
the
second
most
<collocation>massive neptunian</collocation>
moon
it
has
only
one
quarter
of
one
percent
of
the
mass
of
triton


neptune
closest
four
moons
naiad
and
galatea
orbit
close
enough
to
be
inside
neptune
rings


the
next
farthest
out
was
originally
discovered
in
when
it
had
a
star


the
moon
was
credited
for
causing
neptune
<collocation>ring arcs</collocation>
when
voyager
observed
neptune
in


five
new
unusual
moons
discovered
between
