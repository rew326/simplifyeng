he
was
born
in
shropshire


he
is
famous
for
his
work
on
the
theory
of
evolution


his
book
on
the
origin
of
species
did
two
things


first
it
provided
a
great
deal
of
evidence
that
evolution
has
taken
place


second
it
proposed
a
theory
to
explain
how
evolution
works


that
theory
is
natural
selection


evolution
by
natural
selection
is
the
key
to
understanding
biology
and
the
diversity
of
life
on
earth

darwin
spent
five
years
on
board
a
royal
navy
exploring
ship
the
beagle


he
was
the
guest
naturalist
which
meant
that
he
was
responsible
for
making
collections
and
notes
about
the
animals
plants
and
the
geology
of
the
countries
they
visited


the
ship
crew
made
charts
of
all
the
coastal
areas
which
could
be
used
by
the
navy
wherever
it
went
in
the
world


at
the
time
britain
had
by
far
the
largest
navy
in
the
world
and
an
empire
which
was
global


darwin
collected
everywhere
the
ship
weighed
anchor


he
found
huge
fossils
of
recently
extinct
mammals
experienced
an
earthquake
in
chile
and
noticed
the
land
had
been
raised


he
knew
of
raised
beaches
elsewhere
high
in
the
andes
with
fossil
seashells
and
trees
which
had
once
grown
on
a
<collocation>sandy beach</collocation>


obviously
the
earth
was
constantly
changing
with
land
rising
in
some
places
and
sinking
in
others


he
collected
birds
and
insects
and
sent
shipments
back
to
cambridge
for
experts
to
identify


darwin
was
the
first
dedicated
naturalist
to
visit
the
islands
off
the
west
coast
of
ecuador


he
noticed
that
some
of
the
birds
were
like
mockingbirds
on
the
mainland
but
different
enough
to
be
placed
in
separate
species


he
began
to
wonder
how
so
many
new
species
came
to
be
on
these
islands


when
darwin
got
back
to
england
he
edited
a
series
of
scientific
reviews
of
the
voyage
and
he
wrote
a
personal
journal
which
we
know
as
the
voyage
of
the
beagle


it
is
one
of
the
great
natural
history
<collocation>travel diaries</collocation>


darwin
who
already
had
two
children
with
his
wife
emma
bought
down
house
in
the
village
of
kent
in


he
lived
there
for
the
rest
of
his
life
and
today
the
house
and
contents
are
open
to
the
public


evolution
while
on
beagle
and
later
back
home
in
london
darwin
had
come
across
the
ideas
of
the
malthus


malthus
had
realized
that
although
humans
could
double
their
population
every
years
it
did
not
happen
in
practice


he
thought
the
reason
was
that
a
struggle
for
existence
or
resources
limited
their
numbers


if
numbers
increased
then
famine
wars
and
diseases
caused
more
deaths


darwin
who
knew
that
all
living
things
could
in
principle
increase
their
numbers
began
to
think
about
why
some
survived
while
others
did
not


his
answer
took
years
to
develop


the
theory
of
evolution
says
that
all
living
things
on
earth
including
plants
animals
and
microbes
come
from
a
common
ancestor
by
slowly
changing
throughout
the
generations


darwin
suggested
that
the
way
living
things
changed
over
time
is
through
natural
selection


this
is
the
better
survival
and
reproduction
of
those
that
best
fit
their
environment


fitting
into
the
place
where
you
live
is
called
adapting


those
who
fit
best
into
the
place
where
they
live
the
best
adapted
have
the
best
chance
to
survive
and
breed


those
who
are
less
tend
not
to
survive


if
they
do
not
survive
well
enough
to
raise
young
this
means
they
do
not
pass
on
their
genes


in
this
way
the
species
gradually
changes


the
first
chapter
of
the
origin
deals
with
domesticated
animals
such
as
cattle
and
dogs


darwin
reminded
readers
of
the
huge
changes
mankind
had
made
in
its
domestic
animals
which
were
once
wild
species


the
changes
were
brought
about
by
selective
breeding
choosing
animals
with
desirable
characters
to
breed
from


this
had
been
done
generation
after
generation
until
our
modern
breeds
were
produced


perhaps
what
man
had
done
deliberately
might
happen
in
nature
where
some
would
leave
more
offspring
than
others


darwin
noticed
that
although
young
plants
or
animals
are
very
similar
to
their
parents
no
two
are
exactly
the
same
and
there
is
always
a
range
of
shape
size
color
and
so
on


some
of
these
differences
the
plant
or
animal
may
have
got
from
their
own
ancestors
but
some
are
new
and
caused
by
mutations


when
such
differences
made
an
organism
more
able
to
live
in
the
wild
it
would
have
a
better
chance
to
survive
and
would
pass
on
its
genes
to
its
offspring
and
they
to
their
offspring


any
difference
that
would
cause
the
plant
or
animal
to
have
less
of
a
chance
to
live
would
be
less
likely
to
be
passed
on
and
would
eventually
die
out
altogether


in
this
way
groups
of
similar
plants
or
animals
called
species
slowly
change
in
shape
and
form
so
that
they
can
live
more
successfully
and
have
more
offspring
who
will
survive
them


so
natural
selection
had
similarities
to
selective
breeding
except
that
it
would
happen
by
itself
over
a
much
longer
time


he
first
started
thinking
about
this
in
but
it
took
a
full
twenty
years
before
his
ideas
became
public


by
he
was
able
to
write
a
draft
of
the
main
ideas
in
his
notebook


historians
think
that
he
did
not
talk
about
his
theory
because
he
was
afraid
of
public
criticism


he
knew
his
theory
which
did
not
discuss
religion
raised
questions
about
the
<collocation>literal truth</collocation>
of
the
book
of
genesis


whatever
the
reason
he
did
not
publish
his
theory
in
a
book
until


in
he
heard
that
another
biologist
<collocation>alfred russel</collocation>
had
the
same
ideas
about
natural
selection


darwin
and
ideas
were
first
published
in
the
journal
of
the
linnaean
society
in
london


then
darwin
published
his
book
the
next
year


the
name
of
the
book
was
on
the
origin
of
species
by
means
of
natural
selection
or
the
preservation
of
favored
races
in
the
struggle
for
life


this
is
usually
called
the
origin
of
species

adam
smith
adam
smith
july
was
a
scottish
economist
who
is
called
the
father
of
modern
economics


his
book
an
inquiry
into
the
nature
and
causes
of
the
wealth
of
nations
published
in
was
very
important


people
call
the
book
just
the
wealth
of
nations


it
stated
some
of
the
ideas
on
which
modern
economics
is
based
off
especially
market
economics


in
the
wealth
of
nations
adam
smith
asks
what
can
a
person
do
that
is
best
for
his
country


he
decides
that
if
every
person
does
what
is
best
for
himself
and
his
little
circle
of
family
and
friends
then
the
country
will
do
better


this
is
because
every
person
knows
a
lot
about
his
own
situation
what
he
needs
what
he
wants
what
works
and
what
does
not
work
much
more
than
the
government
knows


this
sort
of
thinking
is
called
liberal
theory
a
main
part
of
liberalism


he
was
also
a
philosopher
who
wanted
to
know
why
people
thought
felt
that
some
things
are
good
and
others
bad


he
wrote
an
earlier
book
in
called
the
theory
of
moral
sentiments


he
thought
that
empathy
was
very
important
in
ethics


empathy
is
when
you
see
how
someone
else
is
feeling
imagine
what
it
feels
like
and
then
end
up
feeling
the
same
way
for
smith
empathy
is
like
putting
yourself
in
someone
else
shoes


for
example
empathy
makes
us
feel
happy
to
see
someone
else
who
is
happy
or
feel
sorry
for
someone
who
is
sad


empathy
may
even
make
us
feel
pain
when
we
see
someone
in
pain
as
if
we
had
been
hurt
or
affected


both
smith
and
his
friend
david
who
was
another
scottish
philosopher
wrote
about
the
importance
of
sympathy
in
ethics

early
life
<collocation>isaac newton</collocation>
was
born
on
december
in
a
manor
house
in
england


his
father
died
three
months
before
his
birth


when
isaac
was
three
his
mother
remarried
and
isaac
remained
with
his
grandmother


he
was
not
interested
in
the
family
farm
so
he
was
sent
to
the
university
of
cambridge
to
study


it
is
sometimes
told
that
<collocation>isaac newton</collocation>
was
reading
a
book
under
a
tree
when
an
apple
from
the
tree
fell
on
his
head


this
led
to
his
calculations
of
gravity


early
workings
newton
explained
the
workings
of
the
universe
through
mathematics


he
described
laws
of
motion
and
gravitation


these
laws
are
math
formulas
that
explain
how
objects
move
when
a
force
acts
on
them


isaac
published
his
most
famous
book
principia
in
while
he
was
a
mathematics
professor
at
trinity
college
cambridge


in
the
principia
isaac
explained
three
basic
laws
that
govern
the
way
objects
move


he
then
described
his
idea
or
theory
about
gravity


gravity
is
the
force
that
causes
things
to
fall
down


if
a
pencil
fell
off
a
desk
it
will
land
on
the
floor
not
the
ceiling


in
his
book
isaac
also
used
his
laws
to
show
that
the
planets
revolve
around
the
suns
in
orbits
that
are
oval
not
round


the
three
laws
of
motion
main
newton
laws
of
motion
following
are
the
three
laws
of
motion


the
first
law
law
of
inertia
newton
first
law
of
motion
states
is
that
an
object
that
is
not
being
pushed
or
pulled
by
some
force
will
stay
still
or
will
keep
moving
in
a
straight
line
at
a
steady
speed


it
is
easy
to
understand
that
a
rocket
will
not
move
unless
something
pushes
or
pulls
it


it
is
harder
to
understand
that
an
object
will
continue
to
move
without
help


think
of
the
rocket
again


if
someone
is
flying
a
rocket
and
jumps
off
before
the
rocket
is
stopped
what
happens


the
rocket
continues
on
until
it
goes
into
space


the
tendency
of
an
object
to
remain
still
or
keep
moving
in
a
straight
line
at
a
steady
speed
is
called
inertia


the
second
law
law
of
acceleration
the
second
law
explains
how
a
force
acts
on
an
object


an
object
accelerates
in
the
direction
the
force
is
moving
it


if
someone
gets
on
a
bicycle
and
pushes
the
pedals
forward
the
bicycle
will
begin
to
move


if
someone
gives
the
bicycle
a
push
from
behind
the
bicycle
will
speed
up


if
the
rider
pushes
back
on
the
pedals
the
bicycle
will
slow
down


if
the
rider
turns
the
handlebars
the
bicycle
will
change
direction


the
formula
showing
this
law
is
f
m
a
or
the
force
acting
on
an
object
is
equal
to
mass
times
acceleration


the
third
law
law
of
reciprocal
actions
the
third
law
states
that
if
an
object
is
pushed
or
pulled
the
object
will
be
push
or
pull
equally
in
the
opposite
direction


if
someone
lifts
a
heavy
box
they
use
force
to
push
it
up


the
box
is
heavy
because
it
is
producing
an
equal
force
downward
on
the
lifter
arms


the
weight
is
transferred
through
the
lifter
legs
to
the
floor


the
<collocation>floor presses</collocation>
upward
with
an
equal
force


if
the
floor
pushed
back
with
less
force
the
person
lifting
the
box
would
fall
through
the
floor


if
it
pushed
back
with
more
force
the
lifter
would
fly
into
the
air
like
young
birds
taking
their
first
flight
and
falling
back
down
again


the
discovery
of
the
law
of
gravitation
<collocation>continuum mechanics</collocation>
when
most
people
think
of
<collocation>isaac newton</collocation>
they
think
of
him
sitting
under
an
apple
tree
watching
an
apple
fall


some
people
even
believe
the
apple
fell
onto
his
head


newton
understood
that
what
makes
things
like
apples
fall
to
the
ground
is
a
specific
kind
of
force
the
force
we
call
gravity


newton
thought
that
gravity
was
the
force
of
attraction
between
two
objects
such
as
an
apple
and
the
earth


he
also
thought
that
an
object
with
more
matter
exerted
the
same
force
on
smaller
objects
as
they
exerted
on
it


that
meant
that
the
large
mass
of
the
earth
pulled
objects
toward
it


that
is
why
the
apple
fell
down
instead
of
up
and
why
people
do
not
float
in
the
air


<collocation>isaac newton</collocation>
went
on
thinking
about
gravity


before
newton
people
thought
that
only
objects
near
to
the
earth
would
fall
down


but
newton
thought
that
gravity
should
not
just
be
limited
to
the
earth
and
the
objects
on
it


what
if
gravity
went
to
the
moon
and
beyond


newton
invented
a
formula
for
calculating
the
force
of
attraction
between
two
bodies


he
used
it
to
calculate
the
force
needed
to
keep
the
moon
moving
around
the
earth


then
he
compared
it
with
the
force
that
made
the
apple
fall
downward


after
allowing
for
the
fact
that
the
moon
is
much
farther
from
the
earth
and
has
a
much
greater
mass
he
discovered
that
the
forces
were
the
same


the
moon
is
held
in
an
orbit
around
earth
by
the
pull
of
earth
gravity


the
formula
invented
by
newton
is
called
the
law
of
gravitation


impact
<collocation>isaac newton</collocation>
calculations
changed
the
way
people
understood
the
universe


no
one
had
been
able
to
explain
why
the
planets
stayed
in
their
orbits


what
held
them
up


less
than
years
before
<collocation>isaac newton</collocation>
was
born
it
was
thought
that
the
planets
were
held
in
place
by
an
<collocation>invisible shield</collocation>


isaac
proved
that
they
were
held
in
place
by
the
sun
gravity


he
also
showed
that
the
force
of
gravity
was
affected
by
distance
and
by
mass


he
was
not
the
first
to
understand
that
the
orbit
of
a
planet
was
not
circular
but
more
elongated
like
an
oval


what
he
did
was
to
explain
how
it
worked


sir
<collocation>isaac newton</collocation>
was
the
first
to
discover
the
laws
of
gravitation
and
the
laws
of
motion


he
also
established
a
new
field
in
mathematics
known
as
calculus
though
the
german
had
developed
the
ideas
at
the
same
time


his
work
has
greatly
contributed
in
the
areas
of
science
and
mathematics
making
him
one
of
the
most
influential
scientists
in
human
history


the
great
physicist
albert
einstein
thought
that
newton
idea
of
gravity
was
not
completely
accurate


he
corrected
many
of
the
things
that
newton
did


death
<collocation>isaac newton</collocation>
died
on
march
in
london
england


after
his
death
mercury
was
found
in
his
hair


this
may
have
meant
that
he
had
suffered
from
<collocation>mercury poisoning</collocation>


he
is
buried
in
<collocation>westminster abbey</collocation>


he
set
the
stage
for
many
famous
physicists
to
come
such
as
albert
einstein
james
and
stephen
hawking

include
his
work
in
botany
and
his
theory
of
colours


famous
lines
from
his
books
are
often
quoted
and
some
of
his

have
become
part
of
the

early
life
goethe
was
born
in
frankfurt
am
main
germany


his
father
was
and
very
strict


his
mother
was
only
eighteen
when
he
was
born


when
goethe
was
a
young
boy
he
began
to
write
stories
and
plays
for
his
friends


in
his
youth
he
learned
greek
latin
and
french


he
studied
law
in
leipzig
from
to


he
also
wrote
some
letters
that
are
seen
as
beautiful
and
that
showed
his
promise
as
a
writer


he
continued
his
studies
in
from
to


he
joined
other
young
men
who
wanted
to
change
the
way
that
germans
were
writing


he
thought
that
people
like
were
too
strict
about
writing
poetry


instead
of
the
ideas
of
the
enlightenment
he
wanted
poets
to
be
creative
and
make
their
own
rules


one
man
who
had
many
new
ideas
was
a
poet
named
von
herder


herder
liked
the
plays
of
shakespeare
which
he
had
learned
in
german
as
well
as
folk
poetry


these
ideas
were
exciting
for
goethe
and
he
helped
herder
to
collect
folk
poetry


both
men
believed
that
poetry
should
always
come
from
the
heart
and
that
it
should
be
based
on
the
poet
experiences
instead
of
on
an
idea
of
what
a
good
poem
should
be


some
of
goethe
best
known
poems
were
written
during
this
time
like
der
in
thule
and


goethe
fell
in
love
with
several
women
during
his
lifetime


during
the
early
period
of
his
life
he
was
in
love
with
a
girl
named
the
daughter
of
a
pastor


several
of
his
poems
are
inspired
by
her


he
felt
extremely
sad
when
they
split
up


the
feeling
of
desertion
by
a
lover
is
found
in
a
lot
of
goethe
works


they
are
all
based
on
his
own
experience


his
disappointment
in
love
inspired
him
when
writing
about
in
die
des
and
in
his
great
play
faust


his
poems
also
show
his
ideas
about
science
and
philosophy


die
des
the
sufferings
of
young
is
a
book
written
in
the
form
of
letters
