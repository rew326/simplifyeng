peru
is
a
inca
site
in
peru
in

the
incas
built
the
city
on

mountain
ridge
above

level


they
lived
there
between

ad


other
people
lived
there
before

ad


the
incas
built
houses
fields
and
temples
by
cutting
the
rock
on
the
mountain
so
it
was
flat


they
built
an
observatory
to
look
at
the
stars


when
the
spanish
invaded
peru
the
incas
left


nobody
knows
for
sure
why
they
did
that
but
some
think
it
was
because
they
were
scared
of
the
spanish


the
city
was
left
unfinished
most
likely
due
to
the
spanish
invasion

the

never
found

only
one

into
soil
soil
sometimes
called
dirt
is
the
combination
of
rock
mineral
fragments
pieces
organic
matter
dead
and
living
things
water
and
air


it
is
mostly
made
up
of
grains
of
rock
weathered
by
wind
rain
sun
snow
and
varying
amounts
of
humus


the
type
of
soil
depends
on
the
mix
of
humus
and
on
the
size
of
the
grains
of
the
rock


the
grains
can
be
very
small
and
smooth
such
as
clay
or
they
can
be
larger
like
grains
of
sand
or
even
a
piece
of
gravel


soils
are
important
to
our
ecosystem
for
six
main
reasons
first
soils
are
a
place
for
plants
to
grow
second
soils
control
the
speed
and
the
purity
of
water
that
moves
through
them
third
soils
recycle
nutrients
from
dead
animals
and
plants
fourth
soils
change
the
air
that
surrounds
the
earth
called
the
atmosphere
fifth
soils
are
a
place
to
live
for
animals
insects
and
very
small
living
things
called
microorganisms
sixth
soils
are
the
oldest
and
the
most
used
building
materials


the
climate
is
very
important
when
soil
is
made


soil
from
different
climates
can
have
very
different
qualities
the
types
of
soil
varies
from

the
word
organic
is
used
for
different
things
something
of
or
relating
to
an
organism
<collocation>organic chemistry</collocation>
chemistry
that
is
based
on
carbon
which
is
the
basis
for
all
living
things


organic
matter
in
soil
is
material
that
is
or
once
was
a
plant
or
animal


organic
farming
agriculture
conducted
according
to
certain
standards

a
box
or
means
or
having
three
dimensions


for
example
a
box
is
it
is
solid
and
not
thin
like

piece
of
paper


it
has
volume
a
top
and
bottom
left
and
right
sides
as
well
as
a
front
and
back


you
can
turn
the
box
around
to
view
it
from
another
side
called
a
face
surface
or
simply
side


a
dimension
is
measurable
in
inches
microns
miles
kilometers
or
any
other
unit
of
length


the
three
dimensions
are
often
called
length
or

width
or
