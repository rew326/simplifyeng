the
main
rules
of
cricket
these
are
the
rules


there
are
two
teams
the
team
bowling
has
players
on
the
field


the
team
batting
always
has
two
players
on
the
field


the
captain
of
the
bowling
team
chooses
a
bowler
from
his
team
the
other
players
are
called
fielders


the
bowler
is
trying
to
aim
the
ball
at
a
wicket
which
is
made
up
of
three
sticks
called
stumps
stuck
into
the
earth
with
two
small
sticks
called
bails
balanced
on
them


one
of
the
fielders
called
the
wicket
keeper
stands
behind
the
wicket
to
catch
the
ball
if
the
bowler
misses
the
wicket


the
other
fielders
chase
the
ball
after
the
batsman
has
hit
it


the
bowler
runs
towards
his
wicket
and
bowls
towards
the
batsman
at
the
other
wicket


he
does
not
throw
the
ball


he
bowls
the
ball
with
a
straight
arm


an
over
is
six
balls
meaning
he
bowls
six
times


then
another
player
becomes
the
bowler
for
the
next
over
and
bowls
from
the
other
end
and
so
on


the
same
bowler
can
not
bowl
two
overs
one
after
the
other


the
batsman
is
trying
to
defend
the
wicket
from
getting
hit
with
the
ball


he
does
this
with
a
bat


when
he
hits
the
ball
with
his
bat
he
may
run
toward
the
other
wicket


to
score
a
run
the
two
batsmen
must
both
run
from
their
wicket
to
the
other
wicket
as
many
times
as
they
can


if
the
ball
leaves
the
field
after
being
hit
without
bouncing
six
runs
are
scored


if
the
ball
rolls
or
bounces
out
whether
or
not
the
batter
hit
it
it
counts
as
four
runs


there
are
different
ways
that
a
batsman
can
get
out


the
most
common
ways
are
the
batsman
misses
the
ball
and
it
hits
the
wicket
called
bowled


the
ball
hits
the
batsman
body
when
it
would
have
hit
the
wicket
otherwise


called
lbw
leg
before
wicket


the
way
this
rule
is
applied
is
complicated
this
is
just
the
general
idea


a
<collocation>fielder catches</collocation>
the
ball
after
the
batsman
hits
it
and
before
it
bounces
or
leaves
the
field
called
caught


while
the
batsmen
are
running
a
fielder
can
throw
the
ball
at
the
wicket


if
the
batsmen
can
not
finish
the
run
the
batsman
nearer
to
the
wicket
that
is
hit
is
out
called
run
out


when
a
batsman
is
out
another
comes
onto
the
field
to
take
his
place


the
innings
is
over
when
ten
wickets
are
taken
ten
of
the
<collocation>eleven batsmen</collocation>
are
out


in
a
game
each
side
has
one
innings
and
innings
are
limited
to
a
certain
number
of
overs


in
longer
formats
each
side
has
two
innings
and
there
is
no
specific
limit
to
the
number
of
overs
in
an
innings
