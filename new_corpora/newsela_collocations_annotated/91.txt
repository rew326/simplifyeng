study

somebody
who
studies
theology
is
called
a
theologian


books
or
ideas
about
theology
are
called
theological


theology
may
be
studied
for
many
reasons


some
people
study
theology
to
better
understand
their
own
religion
while
other
people
study
theology
so
that
they
can
compare
religions


the
word
theology
was
first
used
to
describe
the
study
of
god
in
christianity
but
some
now
use
it
to
describe
the
study
of
religion
generally
but
not
everyone
agrees
that
it
is
right
to
do
so


some
people
use
the
words
<collocation>comparative theology</collocation>
when
they
want
to
mean
discussing
the
theology
of
more
than
one
religion
at
once


during
the
high
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>
it
was
thought
that
theology
was
the
highest
subject
learned
in
universities


theology
at
that
time
was
named
the
queen
of
the
sciences


there
was
a
plan
for
young
men
to
study
easy
subjects
and
then
harder
subjects


the
easiest
subjects
were
called
the


the
next
harder
subjects
were
called
the


finally
young
men
were
expected
to
study
theology


this
meant
that
the
other
subjects
existed
primarily
to
help
with
theological
thought


today
richard
writes
that
he
believes
theology
should
not
be
taught
in
universities
because
it
does
not
conform
to
the
scientific
method
and
is
not
useful
