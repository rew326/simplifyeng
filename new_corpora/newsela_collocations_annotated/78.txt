an
english
sentence
must
have
at
least
one
verb


each
main
clause
can
only
have
one
verb


kinds
of
verbs
english
has
two
main
kinds
of
verbs
normal
verbs
called
verbs
and
<collocation>auxiliary verbs</collocation>


the
difference
between
them
is
mainly
in
where
they
can
go
in
a
sentence


some
verbs
are
in
both
groups
but
there
are
very
few
<collocation>auxiliary verbs</collocation>
in
english


there
are
also
two
kinds
of
<collocation>auxiliary verbs</collocation>
verbs
and
verbs


the
table
below
shows
most
of
the
english
auxiliaries

use
of
the
auxiliary
do
sometimes
the
verb
do


it
does
not
really
change
the
meaning


i
do
talk
present
i
did
go
past
it
is
also
used
in
the
negative
when
no
other
<collocation>auxiliary verbs</collocation>
are
used


i
do
talk
present
i
did
go
past
many
other
languages
do
not
use
the
verb
do
as
an
auxiliary
verb


they
use
the
simple
present
for
do
and
the
simple
past
or
perfect
for
did
tense
aspect
and
mood
many
people
think
that
all
different
ways
of
using
verbs
are
all
different
tenses


this
is
not
true


there
are
three
main
systems
related
to
the
verb
tense
aspect
and
mood


tense
tense
is
mainly
used
to
say
when
the
verb
happens
in
the
past
present
or
future


in
order
to
explain
and
understand
tense
it
is
useful
to
imagine
time
as
a
line
on
which
<collocation>past tense</collocation>
<collocation>present tense</collocation>
and
future
tense
are
positioned


some
languages
have
all
three
tenses
some
have
only
two
and
some
have
no
tenses
at
all


english
and
japanese
for
example
have
only
two
tenses
past
and
present


chinese
and
indonesian
verbs
do
not
show
tense


instead
they
use
other
words
in
the
sentence
to
show
when
the
verb
happens


english
<collocation>tenses past</collocation>
<collocation>tense present</collocation>
tense
she

home
she
walks
home
he
ran
quickly
he
runs
quickly
i
could
swim
well
i
can
swim
well
did
you
live
here


do
you
live
here


aspect
aspect
usually
shows
us
things
like
whether
the
action
is
finished
or
not
or
if
something
happens
regularly


english
has
two
aspects
progressive
and
perfect


in
english
aspect
is
usually
shown
by
using
participle
verb
forms


aspect
can
combine
with
present
or
<collocation>past tense</collocation>


<collocation>progressive aspect</collocation>
english
uses
the
usually
together
with
the
auxiliary
be
and
its
forms
am
is
are
was
and
were
to
show
the
<collocation>progressive aspect</collocation>


i
sleeping


present
progressive
he
was
studying
english
last
night


past
progressive
he
will
be
going
to
the
<collocation>store tomorrow</collocation>
future
progressive
many
other
languages
such
as
french
do
not
use
<collocation>progressive tenses</collocation>


i
seen
him
twice


present
perfect
i
had
lived
there
for
three
years


past
perfect
the
past
perfect
can
be
used
to
express
an
unrealized
hope
wish


he
had
intended
to
bake
a
cake
but
ran
out
of
flour


she
had
wanted
to
buy
him
a
gift
but
he
refused


after
if
wish
and
would
rather
the
past
perfect
can
be
used
to
talk
about
past
events
that
never
happened


if
only
i
had
been
born
standing
up


i
wish
you
had
told
me
that
before


i
would
rather
you
had
gone
somewhere
else


mood
finally
english
mood
is
now
usually
shown
by
using
verbs


in
the
past
english
had
a
full
mood
system
but
that
has
almost
completely
disappeared


the
subjunctive
mood
now
uses
the
plain
form


there
is
also
a
form
of
be
that
is
used
in
conditionals
to
show
that
something
is
not
true
if
i
were
a
bird
i
would
fly
to
california


sentence
parts
that
go
with
verbs
certain
parts
of
a
sentence
naturally
come
before
verbs
or
after
them
but
these
are
not
always
the
same
for
all
verbs


the
main
sentence
parts
are
subject
object
complement
and
modifier


subjects
almost
all
english
sentences
have
subjects
but
sentences
that
are
orders
called
imperatives
usually
do
not
have
any
subjects


a
subject
usually
comes
before
a
verb
but
it
can
also
come
after
<collocation>auxiliary verbs</collocation>


in
the
following
examples
the
subject
is
underlined
and
the
primary
verb
is
in
bold


we
need
you


the
food
was
good


the
small
boy
with
red
hair
is
sleeping


can
you
see
the
car


no
subject
objects
many
verbs
can
be
followed
by
an
object


these
verbs
are
called
transitive
verbs


in
fact
some
verbs
must
have
an
object
take
but
some
verbs
never
take
an
object
sleep


verbs
that
do
not
take
an
object
are
called
intransitive
verbs


some
verbs
can
even
have
two
objects


they
are
called
verbs


in
the
following
examples
the
object
is
underlined
and
the
primary
verb
is
in
bold


i
sleeping


no
object
i
took
the
book
from
him


i
gave
him
the
book


objects
i
am
happy


no
object
i
became
a
teacher


complement
no
object
i
slept
in
my
bed
object
complements
some
verbs
can
or
must
be
followed
by
a
complement


these
verbs
are
called
linking
verbs
or
copula


in
the
following
examples
the
complement
is
underlined
and
the
verb
is
in
bold


he
is
good


he
is
a
boy


she
became
sick


she
became
a
manager


it
looks
nice


verbs
can
be
modified
by
various
mainly
adverbs


note
that
verbs
generally
do
not
need
it
usually
a
choice


in
the
following
examples
the
adverb
is
underlined
and
the
verb
is
in
bold


the
boy
ran
quickly


the
freely
swinging
rope
hit
him


verbs
also
commonly
take
a
variety
of
other
including
prepositions


differences
between
verbs
and
other
kinds
of
words
sometimes
a
verb
and
another
word
can
have
the
same
shape


in
these
cases
you
can
usually
see
the
difference
by
looking
at
various
properties
of
the
words


verbs
adjectives
sometimes
a
verb
and
an
adjective
can
have
the
same
shape


usually
this
happens
with
participles


for
example
the
present
<collocation>participle interesting</collocation>
and
the
adjective
interesting
look
the
same


verbs
are
different
from
adjectives
though
because
they
can
not
be
modified
by
very
more
or
most


for
example
you
can
say
that
is
very
interesting
so
you
know
interesting
is
an
adjective
here


but
you
can
not
say
my
teacher
is
very
interesting
me
in
math
because
in
this
sentence
interesting
is
a
verb


on
the
other
hand
if
you
can
not
change
the
be
verb
to
seem
or
become
it
is
probably
a
verb


he
was
isolated
he
became
isolated
isolated
is
an
adjective
the
door
was
opening
the
door
became
opening
opening
is
a
verb
verbs
nouns
the
sometimes
looks
like
a
noun


this
is
especially
true
when
it
is
used
as
a
subject
as
in
the
following
example
running
is
good
for
you


the
main
differences
between
these
verbs
and
nouns
are
number
and
verbs
can
not
generally
be
modified
by
adjectives
and
nouns
can
not
generally
be
modified
by
adverbs


so
in
running
regularly
is
good
for
you
running
is
a
verb
because
it
is
modified
by
regularly
an
adverb


number
verbs
can
not
change
for
number
so
if
you
can
make
the
word
plural
it
is
a
noun
not
a
verb


for
example
this
drawing
is
nice
can
change
to
these
drawings
are
nice
so
drawing
is
a
noun


but
drawing
trees
is
fun
can
not
change
to
drawings
trees
is
fun
so
it
is
a
verb
here


many
verbs
can
take
objects
or
complements
but
nouns
can
not


so
in
parking
the
car
is
hard
parking
is
a
verb
because
it
takes
the
object
the
car


but
if
you
say
there
no
parking
parking
may
be
a
noun
because
it
does
not
have
an
object


verbs
prepositions
some
verbs
have
become
prepositions


again
usually
these
share
a
shape
with
participles


here
are
some
examples
given
the
problems
i
do
not
think
we
should
go


we
have
many
helpers
including
john


according
to
the
map
we
are
here


he
went
to
hospital
following
the
fight


the
main
difference
between
verbs
and
prepositions
is
that
verbs
have
a
subject


even
if
the
subject
is
not
written
you
can
understand
what
it
is


prepositions
do
not
have
a
subject

mass


the
volume
of
a

volume
implies
a
context
where
by
convention
the
length
is
the
longest
distance
between
the

extremities
the
width
or
breadth
refers
to
the
size
of

venus
venus
is
the
second
planet

it
is
a
terrestrial
planet
because
it
has
a
solid
rocky
surface


the
other
terrestrial
planets
are
mercury
earth
and
mars


astronomers
have
known
venus
for
thousands
of
years


the
ancient
romans
named
it
after
their
goddess
venus


venus
is
the
brightest
thing
in
the
night
sky
except
for
the
moon


it
is
sometimes
called
the
morning
star
or
the
evening
star
as
it
is
brightest
just
before
the
sun
comes
up
in
the
morning
and
just
after
the
sun
goes
down
in
the
evening


venus
comes
closer
to
the
earth
than
any
other
planet
does


venus
is
sometimes
called
the
sister
planet
of
earth
as
they
are
quite

ways
the
two
planets
are
very
different


venus
atmosphere
air
is

sulphuric
acid
is
a
chemical
that
is
very
poisonous
to
humans


the
thick
atmosphere
has
made
it
hard
to
see
the
surface
and
until
the
century
many
people
thought

venus
atmosphere
is
mostly
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
and
nitrogen
gas
with
clouds
of
sulphuric
acid


because
the
atmosphere
is
so
thick
or
dense
the
pressure
is
very
high


the
pressure
is
times
the
pressure
on
earth
enough
to
crush
many

it
is
impossible
to
see
the
planet
surface
from
space
as
the
thick

layer
reflects
of
the

that
hits
it


the

is
by

transit
of

venus
can

history
the
pope
used
to
rule
the
papal
states


this
used
to
cover
all
of
central
italy


popes
had
always
tried
to
stop
italy
becoming
one
country
because
they
might
lose
their
control
of
the
papal
states


in
italy
was
unified
under
the
king
of
savoy
but
rome
and
remained
unconquered


only
on
september
the
italian
troops
invaded
and
beat
the
papal
troops


rome
became
capital
of
the
new
kingdom


the
pope
said
he
was
a
prisoner
of
the
italian
state
and
excommunicated
all
the
people
who
helped
invade
his
state


this
stopped
catholics
from
taking
part
in
public
life
