there
were
two

classical

it
was
taught
in

schools

all
universities
used
latin
as
the
teaching
language


latin
began
to
lose
its
importance
in
the

it
was
still
often
used
by
authors
of
scientific
books
and
encyclopedias


until
about
many
universities
accepted
dissertations
written
in
latin


some
languages
spoken
today
came
from
the
latin
language


those
languages
are
called
romance
languages


the

romance

are
french
romanian
italian
portuguese

spanish


other
languages
are
related

the
romance
languages
are
very
close

and
it
is
possible
for
the
speakers
of
one
romance
language
to
understand
another
to
at

some
extent


for

became
much
more
common


it
was
mostly
through
the

buddhism
is
a
religion
in
other
words
buddhists
do
believe
in
a

philosophy


it
began
in
india
but
is
almost
entirely
gone

of
the
dynasty
drove
out
this
system
of
beliefs

or
less
forcing
buddhism
to
flee
east
where
it
eventually
took
strong
roots
in
china
