logic
helps
people

a

the
symbol
of
communism
and
workers
power


communism
is
a
socialist
social
system
in
which
the
means
of
production
are
commonly
owned
and
which
has
no
state
money
or
social
classes


it
is
also
a
political
way
of
thinking
and
an
idea
of
how
to
get
to
such
a
society


communism
says
that
the
people
of
any
and
every
place
in
the
world
should
all
own
the
factories
and
farms
that
are
used
to
make
goods
and
food


this
social
process
is
known
as
common
ownership


the
main
differences
between
socialism
and
communism
are
that
in
a
communist
society
the
state
and
money
do
not
exist


work
is
not
something
a
person
must
do
to
stay
alive
but
is
rather
something
people
can
choose
whether
or
not
to
do

according
to
communist
writers
and
thinkers
the
goal
of
communism
is
to
create
a
<collocation>classless society</collocation>
by
eliminating
the
power
of
the
bourgeoisie
the
ruling
class
who
own
the
means
of
production
and
creating
a
dictatorship
of
the
proletariat
the
working
class


communism
is
not
but
they
do
believe
that
decisions
should
be
made
to
benefit
the
collective
population
rather
than
to
serve
the
greed
of
one
or
several
individuals


in
a
nutshell
assume
there
are
three
men


one
has
two
units
of
a
specific
good
one
has
one
unit
of
the
same
good
and
another
has
no
units
of
the
good


the
communist
party
would
take
one
of
the
units
from
the
first
man
and
give
it
to
the
third
man


politics
some
socialists
believed
that
socialists
could
take
state
power
in
democratic
elections


they
tried
to
make
socialist
parties
in
their
own
countries
win
elections


others
thought
that
the
state
was
created
to
maintain
capitalism
and
that
capitalists
would
never
allow
communists
to
take
power


they
thought
there
needed
to
be
a
war
or
revolution
in
order
to
create
a
new
workers
state


most
of
the
countries
that
claimed
to
be
workers
states
either
had
a
violent
revolution
or
were
invaded
by
a
country
that
left
behind
a
government


some
democratic
countries
today
have
active
communist
parties
such
as
in
india
italy
and
france


in
some
countries
especially
those
that
used
to
be
ruled
by
communist
parties
the
communist
party
is
illegal
or
discouraged
from
holding
power
like
in
eastern
europe


they
also
have

history
marx
the
inventor
of
communism
in
marx
and
wrote
the
<collocation>communist manifesto</collocation>


it
was
a
short
book
with
the
basic
ideas
of
communism


most
socialists
and
communists
today
still
use
this
book
to
help
them
understand
politics
and
economics


many
read
it
too
even
if
they
do
not
agree
with
everything
in
it


marx
said
that
for
society
to
change
into
a
communist
way
of
living
there
would
have
to
be
a
transitional
period


during
this
transitional
period
the
workers
would
govern
society


marx
was
very
interested
in
the
experience
of
the
<collocation>paris commune</collocation>
of
when
the
workers
of
paris
ran
the
city
following
the
defeat
of
the
french
army
by
the
prussian
army


he
thought
that
this
practical
experience
was
more
important
than
the
theoretical
views
of
the
various
radical
groups


many
groups
and
individuals
liked
marx
ideas


by
the
beginning
of
the
twentieth
century
there
was
a
socialist
movement
called
social
democracy


it
was
influenced
by
his
ideas


they
said
that
the
workers
in
different
countries
had
more
in
common
with
each
other
than
the
workers
had
in
common
with
the
bosses
within
their
own
nation


in
lenin
and
leon
led
a
russian
group
called
the
bolsheviks
in
the
october
revolution


they
got
rid
of
the
temporary
government
of
russia
which
was
formed
after
the
february
revolution
against
the
tsar
emperor


they
established
the
union
of
soviet
<collocation>socialist republics</collocation>
also
called
the
soviet
union
or
ussr


the
soviet
union
was
the
first
country
claiming
to
have
established
a
workers
state


in
reality
the
country
never
became
communist
in
the
way
that
marx
and
described


during
the
century
many
people
tried
to
establish
workers
states


in
the
late
china
also
had
a
revolution
and
created
a
new
government
with
mao
as
its
leader


in
the
the
island
of
cuba
had
a
revolution
and
created
a
new
government
with
fidel
castro
as
its
leader


at
one
time
there
were
many
such
countries
and
it
seemed
as
though
communism
would
win


but
communist
party
governments
forgot
to
use
democracy
a
very
important
part
of
socialism
and
communism


because
of
this
the
governments
became
separate
from
the
people
making
communism
difficult


this
also
led
to
disagreements
and
splits
between
countries


by
the
of
the
world
had
overthrown
capitalism
and
were
trying
to
build
communism


most
of
these
countries
followed
the
model
of
the
soviet
union


some
followed
the
model
of
china


the
other
of
the
world
still
lived
in
capitalism
and
this
led
to
a
divide
between
capitalist
countries
and
countries
that
called
themselves
socialist


this
was
called
the
cold
war
because
it
was
not
fought
with
weapons
or
armies
but
competing
ideas


however
this
could
have
turned
into
a
large
war


the
usa
and
the
soviet
union
were
competing
to
have
the
biggest
army
and
having
the
most
dangerous
weapons


this
was
called
the
arms
race


since
when
the
berlin
wall
was
torn
down
most
countries
that
used
to
call
themselves
workers
states
have
returned
to
capitalism


communism
now
has
much
less
influence
around
the
world


in
the
soviet
union
broke
up


however
around
a
quarter
of
the
world
people
still
live
in
states
controlled
by
a
communist
party


most
of
these
are
in
china


the
other
countries
include
cuba
vietnam
and
laos


there
are
also
communist
movements
in
latin
america
and
south
africa


disputes
many
people
have
written
their
own
ideas
about
communism


lenin
of
russia
thought
that
there
had
to
be
a
group
of
revolutionaries
called
a
vanguard
to
lead
a
socialist
revolution
worldwide
and
create
a
communist
society
everywhere


leon
also
from
russia
argued
that
socialism
had
to
be
international
and
it
was
not
important
to
make
it
happen
first
in
russia


he
also
did
not
like
joseph
stalin
who
became
the
leader
of
the
ussr
after
lenin
death
in


was
made
to
leave
the
soviet
union
by
stalin
in
and
then
killed
in


this
scared
many
people
and
lots
of
communists
argued
about
whether
this
was
right
and
whose
ideas
should
be
followed


stalin
thought
that
it
was
important
to
make
the
soviet
union
powerful
first
then
spread
it
around
the
world
when
it
was
stronger


many
communists
like
leon
said
that
stalin
was
not
a
real
communist
because
the
original
idea
of
communism
needed
small
groups
of
workers
voting
and
deciding
on
things
together
and
stalin
in
no
way
supported
voting
or
democracy


yet
there
are
communist
schools
of
thought
which
agree
with
stalin
mainly
because
of
his
<collocation>rapid industrialization</collocation>
and
victory
over
germany


mao
of
china
thought
that
other
classes
would
be
important
to
the
revolution
in
china
and
other
third
world
countries
because
the
working
classes
in
these
countries
were
small


mao
ideas
on
communism
are
usually
called
maoism
or
mao
thought


after
the
death
of
stalin
in
mao
saw
himself
as
the
leader
of
worldwide
communism
until
he
died
in


today
the
chinese
government
is
still
ruled
by
the
communist
party
but
they
actually
have
what
is
called
a
mixed
economy


they
have
borrowed
many
things
from
capitalism


the
government
in
china
today
does
not
follow
maoism


revolutionaries
in
other
countries
like
india
and
nepal
still
like
his
ideas
and
are
trying
to
use
them
in
their
own
countries


term
usage
the
term
communism
is
vague
in
describing
political
organizations
of
the
left


many
political
parties
calling
themselves
communist
may
be
in
practice
more
reformist
supportive
of
reforms
and
slow
pace
of
change
rather
than
revolution
than
some
parties
calling
themselves
socialists


many
communist
parties
in
latin
america
have
lost
many
members
because
these
parties
do
different
things
than
what
they
promised
when
they
have
gotten
power


in
chile
between
under
the
coalition
groups
of
parties
of
popular
unity
lead
by
salvador
the
communist
party
of
chile
was
to
the
right
of
the
socialist
party
of
chile
meaning
that
it
was
more
reformist
than
the
socialist
party


many
communist
parties
will
use
a
reformist
strategy


they
say
working
class
people
are
not
organised
enough
to
carry
out
big
changes
to
their
society


they
put
forward
candidates
that
will
be
elected
democratically


once
communists
become
elected
to
parliament
or
the
senate
they
will
then
fight
for
the
working
class


this
will
allow
working
class
people
to
transform
their
capitalist
society
into
a
socialist
one


symbols
and
culture
the
color
red
is
a
symbol
of
communism
around
the
world


a
red
star
sometimes
also
stands
for
communism


the

is
a
well

the
idea
of
resurrection
is
found
in
writings
of
ancient
religions
in
the
middle
east


some
egyptian
and
<collocation>canaanite writings</collocation>
tell
of
gods
being
resurrected
such
as
osiris
and
baal


in
greek
mythology
many
men
and
women
were
given
eternal
life
by
being
resurrected
from
the
dead


in
their
stories
some
who
came
back
to
life
as
gods
were
alcmene
castor
and


but
the
greek
philosophers
at
that
time
did
not
believe
in
a
physical
rebirth


religions
christianity
christians
believe
that
<collocation>jesus christ</collocation>
was
resurrected


they
also
believe
in
resurrection
for
all
people
after
they
die


this
is
based
on
the
gospels
and
on
saint
paul
writings
in
the
new
testament


the
resurrection
of
jesus
is
the
christian
belief
that
he
returned
to
life
by
a
miracle


he
died
by
crucifixion
on
friday
and
rose
from
his
tomb
to
new
life
on
sunday
morning


this
belief
is
celebrated
at
easter


the
resurrection
of
<collocation>jesus christ</collocation>
is
written
about
by
the
evangelists
in
the
new
testament


they
are
the
authors
of
the
four
gospels
in
the
new
testament


christians
believe
the
resurrection
is
a
central
part
of
the
christian
faith


jesus
died
on
the
cross
to
save
mankind


when
he
was
resurrected
jesus
defeated
death


he
is
alive
forever
and
sitting
at
god
right
hand
on
a
throne


this
gives
christians
the
hope
of
a
new
life
after
death


this
is
because
his
resurrection
mirrors
the
future
for
all
christians
after
they
die


with
<collocation>jesus christ</collocation>
and
with
humans
the
bible
shows
that
the
resurrected
body
is
changed
from
the
original


this
is
because
the
human
body
while
alive
is
weak
and
frail


but
the
resurrected
person
lives
for
ever


all
four
gospels
tell
about
jesus
being
raised
from
the

they
also
write
about
three
