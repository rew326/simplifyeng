platonic
realism
is
the
theory
of
reality
developed
by
plato
and
explained
in
his
theory
of
forms


platonic
realism
states
that
the
visible
world
of
particular
things
is
a
shifting
exhibition
like
<collocation>shadows cast</collocation>
on

notes
origin
among
the
natural
philosophers
in
ancient
greece
the
problem
of
universals
was
the
mystery
of
where
particular
things
derive
their
traits
that
we
perceive
as
universals
for
instance
red
or
apple
or
good
or
woman
or
truth


plato
explained
that
the
particular
things
of
the
visible
world
are
imperfect
transient
copies
of
the
universal
ideas
that
are
the
perfect
lasting
forms


existing
exist
outside
space
and
time
the
forms
are
the
universals
and
act
as
templates
from
which
particulars
manifest


in
his
metaphysics
aristotle
a
student
of
plato
explained
that
socrates
and
his
own
student
plato
held
it
significant
that
the
world
is
in
flux
much
as
had
commented
you
can
not
step
into
the
same
river
twice
a
theme
of
the
a
group
of
philosophers


<collocation>influence plato</collocation>
quest
plato
considered
that
only
the
mind
could
access
the
<collocation>timeless reality</collocation>
of
truths
the
realm
of
the
forms
casting
the
visible
world


plato
metaphorical
allegory
of
the
cave
whereby
humans
only
know
reality
as
shadows
of
the
real
things
they
see
interacting
on
a
wall
suggests
the
practical
consequences
of
platonic
realism
as
to
natural
philosophy
in
its
endeavor
to
explain
the
natural
world
and
as
to
values
in
human
society


value
theory
comprises
ethics
aesthetics
and
political
philosophy


plato
had
led
the
focused
application
of
geometry
developed
by
euclid
to
explain
the
natural
world


yet
by
his
view
of
nature
plato
regarded
astronomy
as
similar
to
seeking
a
theoretical
proof
in
geometry
abstract
and
not
the
real
world
whereupon
the
mind
insights
derived
from
a
quest
to
hold
other
truths
through
the
mind
probing
of
ethics
and
aesthetics
would
yield
discovery
of
truths
within
the
realm
of
forms
outside
space
and
time


aristotle
answer
aristotle
a
student
of
plato
answered
the
problem
of
universals
differently


aristotle
explained
that
universals
are
concepts
corresponding
to
traits
borne
and
shared
by
the
particular
things
themselves


aristotle
did
not
regard
all
reality
as
visible
as
he
recognized
existence
of
souls
yet
regarded
souls
as
unobserved
parts
of
the
visible
world
real
in
itself


aristotelian
realism
largely
shaped
the
course
of
western
thought


aristotle
developed
a
more
or
less
full
description
and
explanation
of
the
natural
world
and
developed
logic
logic
to
derive
conclusions
of
the
relations
among
things


aristotle
grounding
in
the
visible
world
was
a
metaphysical
approach
that
suggested
what
evolved
by
some
years
later
into
empirical
science


some
and
physicists
are
for
instance
max
and
roger


yet
today
usually
view
entities
within
the
visible
world
as
real
and
simply
regard
universal
abstractions
like
numbers
sets
propositions
and
geometry
as
corresponding
to
real
and
timeless
entities
that
also
exist
though
pure
regard
only
the
forms
or
their
realm
as
real


by
way
of
string
theory
and
the
holographic
principle
some
<collocation>physicists conjecture</collocation>
that
plato
allegory
of
the
cave
approximates
the
natural
world
structure


who
regards
only
the
mathematical
structure
of
the
universe
as
real
has
been
called
a
radical


robert
flask

in
this
picture
but
<collocation>perpetual motion</collocation>
machines

the
paradox
is
a
variant
of
the
<collocation>liar paradox</collocation>
a
paradox
is
a
sentence
in
logic
that
can
not
be
true
but
also
can
not
be
false


many
famous
problems
of
this
kind
exist


one
of
most
famous
paradoxes
is
called
the
liar
paradox


it
is
the
simple
sentence
this
sentence
is
a
lie


if
the
sentence
is
true
then
it
is
a
lie
as
it
says


but
if
it
is
a
lie
how
can
it
be
true


a
lie
can
not
also
be
the
truth


so
the
sentence
being
true
makes
it
a
lie


if
the
sentence
is
a
lie
then
it
is
not
as
it
says
it
is
true


but
that
is
just
what
the
sentence
says


so
that
makes
it
true


so
the
sentence
being
a
lie
makes
it
true


this
paradox
is
not
just
true
in
english
but
in
any
language
powerful
enough
for
a
sentence
to
make
a
claim
about
itself


this
is
true
of
mathematics
as
well


paradox
can
never
be
removed
from
any
symbol
system
that
makes
claims
about
itself


another
example
is
the
statement
that
there
is
no
cabal


only
a
cabal
can
know
if
there
is
no
cabal
so
this
is
either
a
guess
or
it
is
a
cabal
trying
to
pretend
it
does
not
exist


other
famous
examples
paradox
of
motion
simpson
paradox
in
statistics
a
paradox
can
also
arise
in
ethics


taking
power
over
others
is
often
also
required
to
protect
them
but
also
one
of
the
things
being
protected
is
their
ability
to
do
as
they
please
which
this
power
interferes
with


there
is
another
article
on
ethical
dilemma
which
means
a
paradox
arising
in
ethics


because
a
paradox
forces
us
to
think
out
of
the
box
about
possibilities
other
than
true
or
false
in
logic
right
or
wrong
in
morality
it
is
considered
very
important
in
education


people
who
do
not
see
a
paradox
where
others
do
are
likely
to
be
too
certain
they
are
right

crop
more
than
<collocation>years ago</collocation>


when
the
europeans
came
to
south
america

the
they
took
the
potato
back
to
europe


it
took
nearly
years
for
the
potato
to
become
a
widely
grown
crop


in
the
the
farmers
in
ireland
began
growing
potatoes
because
they
grew
well
in
the
poor
soils


they
also
have
most
of
the
vitamins
that
people
need
to
survive


the
irish
became
so
dependent
on
the
potato
that
when
the
crop
failed
in
there
was
a
famine
and
many
people
starved
to

plants
are
one
of
five
big
groups
kingdoms
of
living
things


they
are
which
means
they
have
complex
cells
and
make
their
own
food


usually
they
can
not
move
not
counting
growth


plants
include
familiar
types
such
as
trees
herbs
bushes
grasses
vines
ferns
and
green
algae


the
scientific
study
of
plants
known
as
botany
has
identified
about
extant
living
species
of
plants


fungi
and
algae
are
not
classed
as
plants


most
plants
grow
in
the
ground
with
stems
above
and
roots
below


water
and
some
nutrients
come
from
the
roots


the
evaporation
of
water
from
pores
in
the
leaves
pulls
water
through
the
plant


this
is
called


a
plant
needs
sunlight
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
minerals
and
water
to
make
food


a
green
substance
in
plants
called
chlorophyll
traps
the
energy
from
the
sun
needed
to
make
food


chlorophyll
is
mostly
found
in
leaves
inside
which
are
inside
the
leaf
cells


the
leaf
can
be
thought
of
as
a
food
factory


leaves
of
plants
vary
in
shape
and
size
but
they
are
always
the
plant
organ
best
suited
to
capture
solar
energy


once
the
food
is
made
in
the
leaf
it
is
transported
to
the
other
parts
of
the
plant

as
stems

also
mean
to
put
something
in

roots
the
roots
of
plants
perform
two
main
functions


first
they
anchor
the
plant
to
the
ground


second
they
absorb
water
and
various
nutrients
dissolved
in
water
from
the
soil


plants
use
the
water
to
make
food


the
water
also
provides
the
plant
with
support


plants
that
lack
water
become
very
limp

can
not

type
of

growth


water
is

roots
to

rest
of

through
special
vessels
in
the
plant


when
the
water
reaches
the
leaves
some
of
it
evaporates
into
the
air

and
other


the
stamen
is
the
male
part
of
the
plant


it
is
composed
of
the
filament
a
stalk
that
holds
the
anther
which
produces
the
pollen


pollen
is
needed
for
plants
to
produce
seeds


the
carpel
is
the
female
part
of
the
flower


the
top
part
of
the
carpel
contains
the
stigma


the
style
is
the
neck
of
the
carpel


the
ovary
is
the
swollen
area
at
the
bottom
of
the
carpel


the
ovary
produces
the
seeds


the
is
a
leaf
that
protects
a
flower
as
a
bud


the
process
by
which
pollen
gets
transferred
from
one
flower
to
another
flower
is
called
pollination


this
transfer
can
happen
in
different
ways


insects
such
as
bees
are
attracted
to
bright
<collocation>scented flowers</collocation>


when
bees
go
into
the
flower
to
gather
nectar
the
spiky
pollen
sticks
to
their
back
legs


the
sticky
stigma
on
another
flower
catches
the
pollen
when
the
bee
lands
or
flies
nearby
it


some
flowers
use
the
wind
to
carry
pollen


their
dangling
stamens
produce
lots
of
pollen
that
is
light
enough
to
be
carried
by
the
wind


their
flowers
are
usually
small
and
not
highly
colored


the
of
these
flowers
are
feathery
and
hang
outside
the
flower
to
catch
the
pollen
as
it
falls


seed
travellers
a
plant
produces
many
spores
or
seeds


lower
plants
such
as
moss
and
ferns
produce
spores


the
seed
plants
are
the
and
angiosperms


if
all
the
seeds
fell
to
the
ground
besides
the
plant
the
area
might
become
overcrowded


there
might
not
be
enough
water
and
minerals
for
all
the
seeds


seeds
usually
have
some
way
to
get
to
new
places


some
seeds
can
be
dispersed
by
the
wind
or
by
water


seeds
inside
juicy
fruits
are
dispersed
after
being
eaten


sometimes
seeds
stick
to
animals
and
are
dispersed
that
way


fossils
the
question
of
the
earliest
plant
fossils
depends
on
what
is
meant
by
the
word
plant


if
by
plants
we
mean
using
chlorophyll
then
in
are
the
first
fossils
million
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
in
the
eon


the
remarkable
precision
is
possible
because
the
fossils
were
sandwiched
between
lava
flows
that
could
be
precisely
dated
from
embedded
zircon
crystals


if
by
plants
we
mean
green
plants
then
the
first
fossils
are
green
algae


this
is
probably
the
majority
position
amongst
professional
botanists


there
is
<collocation>convincing evidence</collocation>
for
the
of
green
algae
and


there
are
still
two
choices
a
group
of
may
be
reproductive
cysts
of
green
algae


if
so
they
are
present
in
the
era


otherwise
there
is
a
large
increase
in
algae
around
in
the
cambrian
period


if
by
plants
we
mean
land
plants
the
first
fossils
are
in
the
silurian


by
the

fossils
of
whole
plants

early

of

ancient

tissue


the
devonian
period
also
saw
the
evolution
of
the
first
tree
in
the
fossil
record


this
tree
had
a
trunk
with
fronds
and
produced
spores


the
coal
measures
are
a
major
source
of
plant
fossils
with
many
groups
of
plants
in

at
this
time


the

is
going
to
happen


it
is
often
very
helpful
to
know
what
is
going
to
happen
to
help
prepare
for
these
future
events


predictions
are
based
on
the
idea
that
two
beginning
positions
that
are
like
each
other
will
have
similar
results


by
watching
something
happen
it
is
possible
to
predict
what
will
happen
if
something
similar
happens


predictions
are
given
by
science
or
fortune
tellers
or
horoscopes


the
most
common
example
of
a
prediction
is
the
<collocation>weather forecast</collocation>


studying
how
weather
happens
lets
people
predict
what
the
weather
will
be
by
looking
at
what
is
currently
happening


this
is
helpful
because
by
knowing
that
it
is
going
to
rain
a
person
can
wear
the
right
clothes
for
it


nostradamus
has
made
many
predictions
about
the
future


in
a
bean
machine
or
box
most
balls
end
up
close
to
the
center


in
the
long
run
they
will
show
a
normal
<collocation>distribution probability</collocation>
is
a
part
of
mathematics


it
has
to
do
with
chance
the
study
of
things
that
might
happen
or
might
not
happen


for
example
using
probability
you
can
show
that
if
you
throw
a
coin
up
in
the
air
and
let
it
land
half
of
the
time
it
will
land
with
one
side
facing
up
and
half
the
time
with
the
other
side
facing
up


many
coins
have
a
picture
of
the
face
of
a
famous
person
on
one
side
and
something
else
on
the
other
side


often
people
call
the
side
with
the
face
heads
and
the
other
side
tails


the
probability
p
of
an
event
is
always
between
zero
impossible
and
one
certain


if
we
roll
a
die
plural
dice
then
the
chance
that
it
will
land
on
is
this
is
because
there
are
numbers
on
a
die


also
the
chance
it
will
land
on
is


this
is
because
it
can
land
on
or


the
chance
of
any
number
between
and
landing
is


every
time
we
roll
the
die
it
will
always
land
on
a
number
between
and


probability
can
be
figured
out
using
mathematics


for
example
if
you
roll
six
dice
the
chance
of
you
getting
a
number
more
than
ten
is
not
obvious
but
can
be
figured
out
using
math
and
science


one
of
the
most
interesting
things
about
chance
is
that
to
figure
out
the
probability
that
two
things
will
both
happen
you
multiply
their
two
probabilities
together


for
instance
suppose
that
you
want
to
know
the
probability
of
rolling
two
dice
and
getting
a
certain
combination
it
could
be
two
or
a
then
a
just
any
two


the
possibility
of
getting
a
is
one
in
six
and
the
possibility
of
getting
a
is
also
one
in
six
so
the
chances
of
getting
a
then
a
is


if
that
number
is
expressed
as
somewhere
between
and
it
equals
which
is
fairly
low


the
possibility
of
getting
a
then
a
and
then
a
would
be
or
which
is
a
much
lower
probability

a
probability
experiment
is
a
situation
where
chance
affects
the
outcome
the
result
of
an
experiment


if
the
experiment
can
only
have
two
outcomes
it
is
named
trial


a
coin
flip
is
a
probability
experiment
because
chance
affects
whether
a
coin
will
land
heads
or
tails
when
it
is
flipped
