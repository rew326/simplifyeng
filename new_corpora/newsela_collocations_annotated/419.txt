a
monitor
a
computer
monitor
is
an
electronic
device
that
shows
pictures


monitors
often
look
similar
to
televisions


the
main
difference
between
a
monitor
and
a
television
is
that
a
monitor
does
not
have
a
television
tuner
to
change
channels


monitors
often
have
higher
display
resolution
than
televisions


a
high
display
resolution
makes
it
easier
to
see
smaller
letters
and
fine
graphics


there
are
three
types
of
computer
displays
the
monitor


these
are
heavy
use
a
lot
of
desk
space
and
electricity


it
is
the
oldest
technology
used
by
monitors
and
is
based
on
the
cathode
<collocation>ray tube</collocation>
technology
that
was
developed
for
television


monitors
are
made
with
better
parts
which
give
a
much
higher
display
resolution
and
<collocation>picture sharpness</collocation>
than
a
television


this
type
of
monitor
is
no
longer
popular

<collocation>much thinner</collocation>
and

than

the
lcd

the
most
common
kind
of

display


it
is
a
newer
technology
than


lcd
monitors
use
much
less
desk
space
are
lightweight
and
use

they
have

many
years

they
also

in

the
price
of

has
fallen
and
they
are
now
used
in

places
