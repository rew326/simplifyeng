was
a

history
at
the
end
of
the
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>
the
dukes
of
burgundy
a
country
that
is
now
part
of
france
united
seventeen
areas


those
areas
were
called
the
netherlands


when
the
daughter
of
a
duke
married
i
holy
roman
emperor
the
netherlands
became
part
of
spain


in
the
century
many
dutch
people
became
protestant


the
king
of
spain
did
not
like
it
he
wanted
all
dutch
to
be
roman
catholic


he
decided
that
all
protestants
should
be
killed


of
course
the
dutch
people
did
not
like
this
and
in
they
started
a
war
against
spain


the
war
lasted
until
therefore
it
is
called
the
eighty
years
war


an
important
leader
of
the
dutch
in
this
war
was
van
of
orange
also
called
william
the
silent


in
the
netherlands
and
spain
signed
peace


the
dutch
people
were
allowed
to
keep
all
the
areas
they
conquered


the
part
of
the
netherlands
that
was
not
conquered
by
the
dutch
stayed
part
of
spain


later
this
part
became
the
country
belgium


when
the
netherlands
became
independent
it
was
a
very
special
country


that
time
almost
all
countries
in
europe
were
ruled
by
a
king
but
the
netherlands
was
a
republic


the
netherlands
was
made
up
of
seven
provinces
that
were
ruled
by
the
big
cities


the
cities
where
ruled
by
the
municipality
which
consisted
from
rich
civilians


together
those
provinces
were
ruled
by
a
a
very
powerful
man
but
compared
to
the
kings
of
other
european
countries
he
had
much
less
power


in
the
century
the
netherlands
was
the
richest
and
one
of
the
most
powerful
countries
in
the
world


therefore
the
dutch
call
the
century
the
golden
age


they
had
possessions
all
around
the
world


the
most
important
possession
were
the
east
indies
a
country
that
is
now
called
indonesia


the
dutch
also
founded
new
which
is
now
called
<collocation>new york</collocation>


the
netherlands
often
fought
wars
against
other
european
countries
especially
the
wars
against
england


de
a
dutch
admiral
became
a
dutch
hero
when
he
defeated
the
english
navy
close
to
london


in
the
century
the
netherlands
became
poorer


many
people
thought
this
was
the
fault
of
the


many
thought
they
had
too
much
power
and
wanted
them
to
get
away


in
the
french
people
deposed
their
king


french
armies
attacked
other
countries
to
depose
their
leaders
too


in
they
attacked
the
netherlands


william
v
had
to
flee
to
england


the
netherlands
were
renamed
to
republic
and
became
a
democracy


but
the
french
were
not
content
with
the
dutch
ruler
so
in
the
french
emperor
napoleon
made
his
brother
louis
king
of
the
netherlands


louis
became
popular
in
the
netherlands
but
the
emperor
was
again
not
content
with
him
so
in
the
netherlands
became
a
part
of
france


in
napoleon
was
defeated
and
the
netherlands
became
independent
again


the
rulers
of
european
countries
thought
it
was
a
<collocation>good idea</collocation>
to
make
the
netherlands
stronger
to
make
them
able
to
resist
another
french
invasion


therefore
belgium
and
luxembourg
were
added
to
the
netherlands


william
i
the
son
of
william
v
became
king


the
belgians
were
not
happy
with
the
dutch
king


in
they
revolted


william
sent
an
army


he
was
much
more
powerful
then
the
belgians
but
after
ten
days
the
french
sent
an
army
to
support
them


in
the
belgians
chose
their
own
king
and
belgium
became
an
independent
country


some
people
thought
the
dutch
king
had
too
much
power


they
wanted
to
give
him
less
power
and
vote
for
the
government
themselves


in
there
were
<collocation>violent revolts</collocation>
against
the
kings
of
many
european
countries


the
dutch
king
was
afraid
the
same
would
happen
in
the
netherlands


therefore
he
allowed
to
write
a
constitution


from
then
on
people
were
allowed
to
vote


at
first
only
rich
men
were
allowed
to
vote


from
on
everyone
was
allowed

shortly
after

declared
its

the

sent
soldiers
to
indonesia


during
the
war
the
dutch
realized
how
it
is
to
be
occupied
by
another

so
some
people
thought
the

should
not
do
the
