in

cosmology
distance
or
proper
distance
is
one
of
several
distances
measured
by
to
define
distances
between
objects


method
to
talk
about
the
shape
of
the
universe
scientists
want
to
forget
that
the
universe
is
expanding


so
they
separate
the
shape
from
time
and
pretend
that
the
universe
is
not
expanding


they
remember
that
really
the
universe
is
expanding
but
they
write
this
in
a
variable
called
the
scale
factor


then
the
distances
they
talk
about
while
putting
the
scale
factor
to
the
side
are
called
distances


when
they
think
about
the
universe
using
distance
they
think
of
the
universe
as
not
expanding


this
way
some
calculations
are
easier


purpose
when
the
part
of
the
universe
which
we
can
see
today
started
it
was
very
small


everything
in
this
part
of
the
universe
was
much
closer
together
than
today


it
was
also
very
hot
and
photons
particles
of
light
were
moving
in
different
directions


light
moves
very
fast
but
the
light
speed
is
limited
and
the
universe
was
expanding
very
fast


comparison
think
of
two
ants
on
the
surface
of
an
expanding
balloon


one
ant
starts
moving
towards
another
but
the
balloon
itself
is
also
expanding


after
a
long
time
the
balloon
starts
expanding
more
slowly


eventually
one
ant
reaches
another


that
like
photons
in
our
universe


some
of
the
light
from
the
stars
you
see
at
night
traveled
for
billions
of
years
to
reach
your
eye


surprisingly
it
started
very
close
to
where
you
were
or
the
atoms
of
which
your
body
consists
but
just
could
not
keep
up
with
the
universe
expansion


of
course
if
something
else
started
out
very
close
to
where
you
were
but
was
not
traveling
toward
you
it
would
be
very
far
away
from
you
now
because
of
the
expansion
