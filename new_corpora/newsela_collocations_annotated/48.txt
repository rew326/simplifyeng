moves
with

size
the
<collocation>stellar disk</collocation>
of
the
milky
way
galaxy
is
approximately
km
in
diameter
and
is
considered
to
be
on
average
about
light
years
thick


it
is
estimated
to
contain
at
least
billion
stars
and
possibly
up
to
billion
stars


the
figure
depends
on
the
number
of
very
or
dwarf
stars
which
are
hard
to
detect
especially
more
than
light
years
from
our
sun


therefore
present
estimates
of
the
total
number
are
uncertain


this
can
be
compared
to
the
one
trillion
stars
of
the
neighbouring
<collocation>andromeda galaxy</collocation>


the
<collocation>stellar disc</collocation>
of
the
milky
way
does
not
have
a
sharp
edge

radius
beyond
which
there
are
no
stars


rather
the
number
of
stars
drops
smoothly
with
distance
from
the
center
of
the
galaxy


beyond
a
radius
of
about
light
years
the
number
of
stars
drops
much
faster
for
reasons
that
are
not
understood


extending
beyond
the
<collocation>stellar disk</collocation>
is
a
much
<collocation>thicker disk</collocation>
of
gas


recent
observations
indicate
that
the
<collocation>gaseous disk</collocation>
of
the
milky
way
has
a
thickness
of
around
light
years
twice
the
previously
accepted
value

the

scale
of
the

the

of
pluto
were
reduced
to
the
size
of
a
us
quarter
about
an
inch
in
diameter
the
milky
way
would
have
a
diameter
of
kilometers


at
kilometers
per
second
it
takes
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
about
million
years
to
complete
one
orbit
of
the

a
galactic
year


the
galactic
halo
extends
outward
but
is
limited
in
size
by
the
orbits
of
two

satellites
the
large
and
the

whose
<collocation>closest approach</collocation>
is
at
about
light

at
this
distance
or
beyond
the
orbits
of
most
halo
objects
would
be
disrupted
by
the

would
likely
be

a

movement
or
motion
is
the
state
of
changing
something
position
that
is
changing
where
something
is


a
flying
bird
or
a
walking
person
are
moving
because
they
change
where
they
are
from
one
place
to
another


there
are
many
kinds
of
science
and
math
related
to
movement


for
example
thanks
to
albert
einstein
we
know
that
all
position
is
relative


this
means
that
everything
position
depends
on
where
they
exist
in
relation
to
other
things


for
example
a
ball
is
feet
away
from
a
box
feet
away
from
a
chair
and
a
foot
away
from
a
table


according
to
einstein
the
ball
position
means
how
far
the
ball
is
from
other
things
so
by
telling
you
how
far
the
ball
was
from
other
things
i
told
you
its
position


an
object
movement
is
also
relative


its
movement
depends
on
where
it
is
in
relation
to
other
things
and
where
it
going
to
in
relation
to
other
things


there
are
many
things
involved
in
movement
such
as
speed
velocity
acceleration
gravity
magnetic
attraction
and
repulsion
friction
and
inertia


also
work
is
needed
to
produce
movement


light

metaphor
is
a
term
for
a
figure
of
speech


it
does
not
use
a
word
in
its
basic
<collocation>literal sense</collocation>


instead
it
uses
a
word
in
a
kind
of
comparison


we
run
and
we
also
say
rivers
run


we
may
run
into
trouble
especially
if
we
run
up
a
bill
at
the
bar


so
a
metaphor
uses
words
to
make
a
picture
in
our
mind


it
takes
a
word
from
its
original
context
and
uses
it
in
another


i
beat
him
with
a
stick
literal
meaning
of
beat


i
beat
him
in
an
argument
metaphorical
meaning
of
beat


metaphors
are
an
essential
part
of
language
it
is
not
possible
to
speak
or
write
without
them


a
simple
example
is
the
word
run


this
has
a
basic
meaning
of
moving
quickly
or
go
with
quick
steps
on
alternate
feet
never
having
both
feet
on
the
ground
at
the
same
time


the
<collocation>concise oxford</collocation>
dictionary
then
gives
other
uses
as
a
verb
uses
as
a
noun
about
uses
in
short
phrases


all
of
these
are
metaphors
although
we
do
not
usually
notice
this


we
use
metaphors
to
make
indirect
comparisons
but
without
using
like
or
as
because
that
would
be
a
simile


a
simile
is
a
direct
comparison
jane
is
like
a
child


a
metaphor
very
often
uses
the
verb
to
be
love
is
war
for
example
not
love
is
like
war
that
is
a
simile


poetry
includes
much
metaphor
usually
more
than
prose


spam
is
an
example
that
any
email
user
knows
about
this
word
was
originally
a
metaphor
from
spam
a
type
of
canned
meat


servers
putting
unwanted
email
into
somebody
inbox
was
similar
to
waiters
putting
unwanted
spam
into
food


this
was
originally
suggested
by
a
python
scene


when
we
use
a
metaphor
very
often
and
we
forget
the
old
meaning
or
forget
that
the
two
meanings
are
connected
this
is
a
dead
metaphor


originally
metaphor
was
a
greek
word
for
transfer


it
came
from
meta
beyond
and
carry


so
the
word
metaphor
in
english
was
a
metaphor
too


today
in
greek
metaphor
is
a
trolley
a
thing
that
is
pushed
for
carrying
shopping
or
bags

metaphors
are
concepts

a

has
a
single
link
between
the

the

thus
has

which
is

<collocation>complex metaphors</collocation>
description
a
complex
metaphor
happens
where
a
simple
metaphor
is
based
on
a
secondary
<collocation>metaphoric element</collocation>


for
example
using
a
metaphor
of
light
for
understanding
may
be
by
saying
throwing
light
rather
than
shining
light


throwing
is
an
extra
metaphor
for
how
light
arrives


examples

lends
weight
to
the
argument

compound
metaphors
description
a
compound
metaphor
is
one
where
there
are
multiple
parts
in
the
metaphor
that
are
used
to
snag
the
listener


these
parts
may
be
enhancement
words
such
as
adverbs
adjectives


each
part
in
the
compound
metaphor
may
be
used
to
signify
an
additional
item
of
meaning


examples
thick
primal
blind
fog
descended
before
his
eyes


the
car
screeched
in
hated
anguish
its
flesh
laid
bare
in
the
raucous
collision


compound
metaphors
are
like
a
multiple
punch
hitting
the
listener
repeatedly
with
<collocation>metaphoric elements</collocation>


where
the
complex
metaphor
uses
stacked
layers
to
enhance
the
metaphor
the
compound
metaphor
uses
sequential
words


the
compound
metaphor
is
also
known
as
a
loose
metaphor


live
and
dead
metaphors
a
live
metaphor
is
one
which
a
reader
notices


a
dead
metaphor
is
one
notices
because
it
has
become
so
common
in
the
language


examples
two
people
walk
off
a
tennis
court


someone
asks
the
loser
what
happened


he
won


he
beat
me


obviously
a
dead

he
thrashed
me


this

metabolism
metabolism
is
the
chemical
reactions
which
keep
us
alive


it
happens
in
the
cells
of
living
organisms


reactions
by
enzymes
allow
organisms
to
grow
reproduce
maintain
their
structures
and
respond
to
their
environments


the
word
metabolism
can
also
refer
to
digestion
and
the
transport
of
substances
into
and
between
different
cells


metabolism
is
usually
divided
into
two
categories


breaks
down
organic
matter
and
harvests
energy
by
way
of
cellular
respiration


uses
energy
to
construct
molecules
such
as
proteins
and
<collocation>nucleic acids</collocation>


the
chemical
reactions
of
metabolism
are
organized
into
metabolic
pathways
or
cycles
like
the
<collocation>krebs cycle</collocation>


one
chemical
is
transformed
through
a
series
of
steps
into
another
chemical
by
a
series
of
enzymes


the
metabolic
system
of
an
organism
decides
which
substances
it
finds
nutritious
and
which
poisonous


for
example
some
use
hydrogen
sulfide
as
a
nutrient
yet
this
gas
is
poisonous
to
animals


the
speed
of
metabolism
the
<collocation>metabolic rate</collocation>
influences
how
much
food
an
organism
will
need
and
how
it
is
able
to
get
that
food


a
striking
feature
of
metabolism
is
the
similarity
of
the
basic
metabolic
pathways
and
components
between
even
vastly
different
species


for
example
the
set
of
carboxylic
acids
that
are
best
known
as
the
intermediates
in
the
citric
acid
cycle
are
present
in
all
known
organisms
being
found
in
species
as
diverse
as
the
unicellular
bacterium
coli
and
huge
<collocation>multicellular organisms</collocation>
like
elephants


these
<collocation>striking similarities</collocation>
in
metabolic
pathways
are
likely
due
to
their
early
appearance
in
the
evolution
of
life
and
kept
because
of
their
efficacy

a
and
light
microscope


<collocation>electron microscope</collocation>
a
microscope
is
a
scientific
instrument
that
makes
things
normally
too
small
to
see
look
bigger
so
they
can
be
seen
better
and
examined
correctly


people
who
use
microscopes
commonly
in
their
jobs
include
doctors
and
scientists


the
earliest
microscopes
had
only
lens
and
are
called
simple
microscopes


<collocation>compound microscopes</collocation>
have
at
least
lenses


in
a
compound
microscope
the
lens
closer
to
the
eye
is
called
the
eyepiece


the
lens
at
the
other
end
is
called
the
objective


microscopes
make
things
seem
larger
than
they
are
from
times
larger
to
about
times
larger


this
is
much
stronger
than
a
magnifying
glass


microscopes
are
commonly
used
in
schools
such
as
high
schools
to
benefit
their
students
in
science
classes
such
as
biology
or
chemistry
class


types
of
microscopes
there
are
many
different
types
of
microscopes


the
most
common
are
compound
light
microscopes
and
<collocation>electron microscopes</collocation>


compound
light
microscopes
reflect
light
under
the
object
being
looked
at


light
then
passes
through
two
lenses
and
makes
the
image
bigger


<collocation>electron microscopes</collocation>
come
in
different
types
as
well


<collocation>transmission electron</collocation>
microscopes
fire
electrons
into
the
object
being
looked
at
which
carry
information
about
how
the
object
looks
into
a
lens


this
is
then
magnified
onto
a
television
screen


<collocation>scanning electron</collocation>
microscopes
also
fire
electrons
at
the
object
but
in
a
single
beam


these
lose
their
power
when
they
strike
the
object
and
the
loss
of
power
results
in
something
else
being
generated

the
mass
of
an
object
is
a
measure
of
an
object
resistance
to
acceleration
sometimes
also
called
inertia


a
mountain
has
typically
more
mass
than
a
rock
for
instance


mass
should
not
be
confused
with
the
related
but
quite
different
concept
of
weight


a
large
mass
like
the
earth
will
attract
a
small
mass
like
a
human
being
with
enough
force
to
keep
the
human
being
from
floating
away


mass
attraction
is
another
word
for
gravity


units
of
mass
the
unit
of
mass
in
the
international
system
of
units
is
the
kilogram
which
is
represented
by
the
symbol
kg


fractions
and
multiples
of
this
basic
unit
include
the
gram
one
thousandth
of
a
kg
symbol
g
and
the
tonne
one
thousand
kg
amongst
many
others


in
some
fields
or
applications
it
is
convenient
to
use
different
units
to
simplify
the
discussions
or
writings


for
instance
atomic
physicists
deal
with
the
tiny
masses
of
individual
atoms
and
measure
them
in
atomic
mass
units


jewelers
normally
work
with
small
gems
and
<collocation>precious stones</collocation>
where
masses
are
traditionally
measured
in
carats
which
correspond
to
mg
or
the
masses
of
stars
are
very
large
and
are
sometimes
expressed
in
units
of
solar
masses


traditional
units
are
still
in
encountered
in
some
countries
imperial
units
such
as
the
ounce
or
the
pound
were
in
widespread
use
within
the
british
empire


some
of
them
are
still
popular
in
the
united
states
which
also
uses
units
like
the
short
<collocation>ton ton</collocation>
pounds
and
the
long
ton
pounds
not
to
be
confused
with
the
<collocation>metric tonne</collocation>
kg


conservation
of
mass
and
relativity
mass
is
an
<collocation>intrinsic property</collocation>
of
the
object
it
does
not
depend
on
its
volume
or
position
in
space
for
instance


for
a
long
time
at
least
since
the
works
of
in
the
second
half
of
the
eighteen
century
it
has
been
known
that
the
sum
of
the
masses
of
objects
that
interact
or
of
the
chemicals
that
react
remain
conserved
throughout
these
processes


this
remains
an
<collocation>excellent approximation</collocation>
for
everyday
life
and
even
most
laboratory
work


however
einstein
has
shown
through
his
special
theory
of
relativity
that
the
mass
m
of
an
object
moving
at
speed
v
with
respect
to
an
observer
must
be
higher
than
the
mass
of
the
same
object
observed
at
rest
m
with
respect
to
the
observer


the
<collocation>applicable formula</collocation>
is
m
v
where
c
stands
for
the
speed
of
light


this
change
in
mass
is
only
important
when
the
speed
of
the
object
with
respect
to
the
observer
becomes
a
large
fraction
of
c

mercury
is
bright
when
it
is
visible
from
earth
ranging
from
to
in
apparent
magnitude


it
can
not
be
easily
seen
as
it
is
usually
too
close
to
the
sun


because
mercury
is
normally
lost
in
the
glare
of
the
sun
except
during
a
solar
eclipse
mercury
can
only
be
seen
in
the
morning
or
<collocation>evening twilight</collocation>


compared
to
what
is
known
about
the
other
planets
in
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
little
is
known
about
mercury


telescopes
on
the
earth
show
only
a
small
<collocation>bright crescent</collocation>


the
first
of
two
spacecraft
to
visit
the
planet
was
mariner
which
mapped
only
about
of
the

the
second
is

finished
mapping
the
planet
in
march


mercury
looks
a
lot
like
earth
moon


it
has
many
craters
with
areas
of
<collocation>smooth plains</collocation>
no
moons
around
it
and
no
atmosphere
as
we
know
it


however
mercury
does
have
an
extremely
thin
atmosphere
known
as
an


unlike
earth
moon
mercury
has
a
large
iron
core
which
gives
off
a
magnetic
field
about
as
strong
as
that
of
the
earth


it
is
a
very
dense
planet
due
to
the
large
size
of
its
core

known
sightings
of
mercury
date
back
to
at
least
the
first
millennium


before
the
century
greek
astronomers
thought
that
mercury
was
two
different
objects
one
able
to
be
seen
only
at
sunrise
which
they
called
apollo
the
other
that
was
only
able
to
be
seen
at
sunset
which
they
called
hermes


the
english
name
for
the
planet
is
from
the
romans
who
named
it
after
the
roman
god
mercury
which
they
thought
to
be
the
same
as
the
greek
<collocation>god hermes</collocation>


the
symbol
for
mercury
is
based
on
hermes
staff


even
though
mercury
is
the
closest
planet
to
the
sun
it
is
not
the
warmest


this
is
because
it
has
no
atmosphere
so
any
heat
that
the
sun
gives
to
it
quickly
escapes
into
space

mercury
is
one
of
four
inner
planets
in

some
of
the
largest
moons
in

<collocation>solar system</collocation>
such
as
ganymede
and
