an
idiom
is
a
word
or
phrase
which
means
something
different
from
its
literal
meaning


idioms
are
common
phrases
or
terms
whose
meaning
is
not
real
but
can
be
understood
by
their
popular
use


because
idioms
can
mean
something
different
from
what
the
words
mean
it
is
difficult
for
someone
not
very
good
at
speaking
the
language
to
use
them
properly


some
idioms
are
only
used
by
some
groups
of
people
or
at
certain
times


the
idiom
shape
up
or
ship
out
which
is
like
saying
improve
your
behavior
or
leave
if
you
do
might
be
said
by
an
employer
or
supervisor
to
an
employee
but
not
to
other
people


idioms
are
not
the
same
thing
as
slang


idioms
are
made
of
normal
words
that
have
a
special
meaning
known
by
almost
everyone


slang
is
usually
special
words
that
are
known
only
by
a
particular
group


to
learn
a
language
a
person
needs
to
learn
the
words
in
that
language
and
how
and
when
to
use
them


but
people
also
need
to
learn
idioms
separately
because
certain
words
together
or
at
certain
times
can
have
different
meanings


in
order
to
understand
an
idiom
one
sometimes
needs
to
know
the
culture
the
idiom
comes
from


to
know
the
history
of
an
idiom
can
be
useful
and
interesting
but
is
not
necessary
to
be
able
to
use
the
idiom
properly


for
example
most
native
british
english
speakers
know
that
no
room
to
swing
a
cat
means
there
was
not
a
lot
of
space
and
can
use
the
idiom
properly
but
few
know
it
is
because
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
sailors
were
punished
by
being
whipped
with
a
whip
called
a
cat
tails


date
february
a
big
space
was
cleared
on
the
ship
so
that
the
person
doing
the
whipping
had
a
lot
of
room
to
swing
the
cat


a
better
understanding
of
an
idiom
is
that
it
is
a
phrase
whose
meaning
can
not
be
understood
from
the
dictionary
definitions
of
each
word
taken
separately


some
common
idioms
break
a
leg
a
way
to
wish
someone
<collocation>good luck</collocation>


to
live
it
up
to
enjoy
life
to
live
widely
to
kick
the
bucket
to
die


shape
up
or
ship
out
used
to
tell
someone
that
they
should
leave
if
they
do
improve
their
behavior
or
performance
to
shed
crocodile
tears
to
cry
about
something
but
without
actually
caring


<collocation>wild goose</collocation>
chase
a
useless
journey
or
