history
walt
disney
worked
very
hard
to
run
his
movie
studio


he
liked
to
spend
weekends
with
his
two
daughters


the
family
liked
going
to
carnivals
and
fairs


disney
wanted
to
build
a
place
that
had
all
of
the
fun
of
the
traveling
fairs
where
parents
and
children
could
ride
together


that
is
how
disney
got
the
idea
for
disneyland


in

talked
to
people
at
stanford
university


he
asked
them
to
find
a
place
that
would
be
a
good
place
to
build
his
park


the
stanford
people
recommended
an
<collocation>orange grove</collocation>
for

friends
thought
the

was
a
crazy
one

an
artist
depiction
of
bigfoot


grouping
possibilities
hominid
hybrid
ape
bear
alien
aka
bigfoot
country
united
states
canada
region
california
habitat
forests
swamps
mountains
in
folklore
bigfoot
also
called
is
a
primate
that
some
people
say
lives
in
remote
areas
of
canada
and
the
united
states


even
though
many
people
claim
to
have
seen
a
bigfoot
or
seen
their
tracks
no
one
has
ever
captured
one
or
found
a
dead
body


for
this
reason
some
people
do
not
believe
in
bigfoot


some
also
believe
bigfoot
is
a
dangerous
monster
because
of
some
<collocation>scary stories</collocation>
told
about
them


most
people
who
study
bigfoot
however
agree
that
the
species
is
probably
gentle
and
intelligent
just
like
humans


bigfoot
is
said
to
be
very
tall
from
to
feet
about
to
meters
and
covered
in
brown
black
red
or
sometimes
even
white
fur
or
hair


they
are
said
to
have
very
big
feet
about
inches
long
meters
which
is
why
they
are
named
bigfoot


are
mostly
seen
in
the
forests
of
the
pacific
northwest
but
sometimes
people
see
them
in
the
great
lakes
area
the
midwest
or
even
in
swamps
in
the
southern
united
states


it
is
thought
that
bigfoot
may
be
related
to
the
yeti
of
the
himalayas


the
name
comes
from
the
language
a
central
salish
language
in
the
salish
language
family


stories
of
this
type
of
creature
are
known
among
a
number
of
first
nations
groups
in
british
columbia


pictures
and
movies
of
bigfoot
sometimes
people
who
see
a
bigfoot
are
able
to
take
a
picture
or
a
movie
of
it


the
most
famous
of
these
is
the
movie


it
was
named
this
because
the
last
names
of
the
men
who
took
the
movie
were
and


in
the
movie
a
large
ape
like
creature
can
be
seen
walking
from
a
lake
to
a
forest


because
this
is
the
best
movie
so
far
of
a
creature
that
may
be
a
bigfoot
scientists
argue
about
it
a
lot


some
think
that
the
creature
is
a
real
bigfoot
while
others
think
that
it
is
just
a
person
in
a
gorilla
costume


because
of
this
people
have
done
experiments
with
men
in
gorilla
costumes
who
try
to
move
like
the
creature
in
the
movie


so
far
none
has
been
able
to
move
just
like
it


this
is
why
there
are
many
bigfoot
hoaxes


he
can
also
be
mistaken
for
a
grizzly
bear


the
evidence
obtained
from
the
movie
is
startling
though
many
have
questioned
about
it


some
experts
believe
if
the
movie
is
played
slightly
faster
it
could
have
been
a
man
wearing
a
rubber
costume


however
aspects
of
the
footage
are
amazing


for
example
biotechnology
scientists
have
said
that
for
bigfoot
to
walk
upright
it
would
need
an
extended
heel


the
creature
in
the
movie
too
has
an
extended
heel


the
<collocation>da vinci</collocation>
code
is
a
book
by
dan
brown


the
book
talks
about
a
religious
group
called
opus
dei
a
famous
artist
named
leonardo
<collocation>da vinci</collocation>
and
some
famous
paintings
he
made
called
the
mona
and
the
<collocation>last supper</collocation>


according
to
in
the
real
history
behind
the
<collocation>da vinci</collocation>
code
dan
brown
based
the
<collocation>da vinci</collocation>
code
on
a
book
called
holy
blood
<collocation>holy grail</collocation>
by
and


this
book
was
based
on
some
papers
found
in
the
national
library
of
france
and
which
were
forgeries


the
papers
were
written
to
show
that
the
man
who
wrote
them
was
really
the
true
king
of
france
and
head
of
an
ancient
secret
society
