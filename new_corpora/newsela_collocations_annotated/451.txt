and
spots
and
a
lighter
colored

but
there
can
be
a
lot
of
differences
in
the
different
leopard
subspecies


there
are
also
often
leopards
who
are
completely
black
those
are
also
called
black
panthers


male
leopards
are
about
larger
than
female
leopards


habitat
originally
the
leopard
lived
in
all
of
africa
but
not
in
the
sahara
and
southern
asia


but
today
many
leopard
subspecies
especially
in
asia
are
endangered
disappearing
or
dying


the
leopard
lives
in
the
largest
range
of
all
big
cats
and
because
of
this
it
has
a
lot
of
different
subspecies


leopards
also
live
in
a
lot
of
different
environments
rainforests
forests
mountains
and
savannas


life
the
leopard
is
mostly
active
at
night


it
is
basically
an
ambush
hunter


it
can
climb
very
well
and
it
stays
up
in
trees
a
lot
of
its
time


it
mostly
eats
mammals
but
also
birds
reptiles
and
insects


<collocation>leopards hunt</collocation>
at
different
times
of
the
day
and
they
also
use
different
methods
for
hunting


most
often
leopards
will
secretly
move
towards
their
prey
and
attack
it
when
they
are
close
or
hide
and
wait
for
it
to
come
close


after
the
hunt
leopards
often
take
their
prey
up
on
a
tree
or
sometimes
hide
it
so
that
other
animals
can
not
take
it
away


leopards
usually
live
alone
and
try
not
to
meet
another
leopard


they
only
come
together
to
mate


young
leopards
leave
their
mothers
after
months


<collocation>diet leopards</collocation>
mostly
eat
monkeys
but
rodents
reptiles
amphibians
insects
birds
and
fish
are
also
eaten


leopards
do
not
usually
eat
humans
but
sometimes
leopards
that
are
hurt
or
sick
can
eat
people
when
they
do
not
have
enough
to

a

to
have

more

is


<collocation>appearance jaguars</collocation>

fur
with
brown
and
black
rosettes
and
spots


they
are
big
and
heavy
and
also
have
very
strong
muscles
which
makes
them
really
powerful


sometimes
there
are
jaguars
who
are
completely
black
but
if
you
look
closely
you
can
still
see
the
spots


they
are
called
black

jaguars
live

they
mostly
live
in
rainforests

also
in
savanna
swamp
and
open
areas


they

they
swim
very
well

jaguars
are
not

with
their
food
but
eat
almost
anything
they
get
big
and
small
mammals
birds
reptiles
fish
and
livestock


it
is
an
ambush
predator


when
hunting
they
usually
try

secretly
get
very
close
to
the
prey
and
then
the
jaguar
suddenly
jumps
at
it
and
throws
it
down


the
jaguar
bites
the
skull
of
its
prey
to
kill
it


it
then
takes
the
prey
to
a
safe
place
and
eats
it


after
a
pregnancy
of
about
days
the
female
gives
birth
to
usually
babies


the
young
leave
their
family
after
years
and
they
become
mature
at
about
years


jaguars
can
live
up
to
years
old
in
freedom
but
in
captivity
such
as
in
zoos
they
can
live
to
years
old

edit


the
range
of
the

by
a

is
a
large
feline
that
lives
in
africa


it
is
the
fastest

animal
and
can
run
up
to
kilometres
per
hour
for
a
short

the
name
cheetah
may
come
from
a
hindi
word
meaning
spotted
one
or
from
the
sanskrit
word


an
adult
has
yellow
or
<collocation>tan fur</collocation>
with
solid
black
round
or
<collocation>oval spots</collocation>
measuring
to
inches
to
centimeters
in
diameter


the
spots
cover
nearly
the
whole
body


only
the
white
throat
and
abdomen
are
not
spotted


the
tail
ends
with
black
rings
and
a
bushy
white
tuft


the
head
is
small
with
eyes
set
high
and
a
black
tear
mark
running
from
the
inner
aspect
of
each
eye
down
to
the
mouth


the
teeth
are
small


an
adult
cheetah
weighs
pounds
kilograms
is
about
inches
centimeters
tall
at
the
shoulder
and
inches
centimeters
long
with
another
inches
centimeters
in
tail


cheetahs
are
sometimes
mistaken
for
leopards


however
the
difference
is
that
leopards
are
much
heavier
animals
with
rosette
shaped
spots
and
no
tear
marks


there
are
also
cheetahs
with
a
different
fur
called
a
king
cheetah


these
cheetahs
have
bigger
spots
and
also
stripes
on
their
fur
because
of
a
mutation


habitats
most
cheetahs
live
in
africa
but
very
few
can
be
found
in
south
asia
and
india


they
live
in
the
savannas


life
cheetahs
are
active
during
the
day
and
hunt
in
the
early
morning
or
late
evening


they
hunt
and
eat
mostly
gazelles
and
other
animals
that
are
not
very
heavy
or
strong


they
also
eat
small
mammals
and
birds
if
they
are
very
hungry


when
the
cheetah
hunts
it
slowly
and
secretly
moves
toward
its
prey


when
it
is
close
to
the
prey
about
meters
it
runs
after
it
very
quickly


when
the
prey
falls
or
is
caught
by
the
cheetah
then
he
bites
the
throat
of
the
prey
so
that
it
dies
because
it
can
not
breathe


the
cheetah
can
not
defend
itself
against
lions
or
hyenas
who
would
take
the
cheetah
prey
away


after
a
pregnancy
of
about
days
the
female
gives
birth
to
usually
babies


young
cheetahs
become
mature
at
about
years
of
age


cheetahs
can
live
to
be
years
old
in
captivity


genetics
the
cheetah
has
unusually
low
genetic
variability
and
a
very
low
sperm
count


their
sperms
also
suffer
from
deformed
and
so
their
movement
is
damaged


apparently
cheetahs
went
through
a
great
reduction
in
numbers
during
the
last
ice
age


inbreeding
after
the
event
further
reduced
the
variation
