the
city
streets
in
the
old
city

follow
a
pattern


the
big
streets
going
north
and
south
are
in
straight
lines


when
they
are
on
the
mountain
they
have
upper
in
front
the
their
names
except
for
garth
street
which
should
be
upper
street


streets
are
called
north
such
as
james
street
north
if
they
are
north
of
king
street
or
road


streets
are
called
south
if
they
are
south
of
king
or


streets
are
called
east
such
as
east
street
or
main
street
east
if
they
are
east
of
james
street
or
upper
james
street


streets
are
called
west
if
they
are
west
of
james
or
upper
james


king
and
main
streets
are
major
roads
that
are
almost
parallel
or
side
by
side
one
another


they
cross
at
the
delta
in
east
hamilton


for
most
of
king
and
main
cars
could
only
travel
one
way


so
instead
of
thinking
of
them
as
two
streets
think
of
them
as
one
street
with
a
very
<collocation>wide boulevard</collocation>
between
them


this
changed
in
the
early
and
most
of
the
streets
in
downtown
hamilton
are
now


throughout
the
city
there
are
some
neighborhoods
with
weird
or
strange
street
names


for
example
birdland
has
streets
named
after
birds
like
cardinal
blue
jay
and
swallow


another
neighborhood
on
the
mountain
has
streets
named
after
people
from
the
french
revolution
such
as
napoleon
josephine
and


west
in
the
lower
city
has
streets
named
after
types

continent


greater

was
the
capital
of
the

during
the
country
later
iron
age


the
monument
first
began
to
be
built
in
the
century
and
work
continued
until
the
century


it
covered
an
area
of
hectares
acres
which
might
have
housed
up
to
people


it
was
a
royal
city
for
the
monarch


one
of
its
most
prominent
features
were
its
walls
some
of
which
were
over
five
metres
high
and
which
were
constructed
without
mortar


eventually
the
city
was
abandoned
and
fell
into
ruin


the

of
zimbabwe
included
the
river
zambezi
in
the
north
the
transvaal
in
the
south
and
botswana
in
the
east

things
over
great
distances


the
city
had
stopped
growing
when
traders
from
portugal
came
to
southern
africa
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
but
nobody
is
sure
why
this
happened


europeans
at
first
thought
that
great
zimbabwe
had
been
built
by
foreigners


now
we
know
it
was
built
by
the
local
people
