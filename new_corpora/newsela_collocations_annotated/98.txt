at
the

velocity
they
appear
to
an
observer
to

a
meteor
shower
is
an
event
when
many
meteors
seem
to
come
from
one
point
in
the
night
sky


these
meteors
are
caused
by
entering
earth
atmosphere
at
extremely
high
speeds
on
<collocation>parallel paths</collocation>


most
meteors
are
smaller
than
a
grain
of
sand
so
almost
all
of
them
burn
up
and
never
hit
the
earth
surface


a
meteor
shower
is
the
result
of
an
interaction
between
a
planet
such
as
earth
and
streams
of
debris
from
a
comet


comets
are
dirty
snowballs
made
up
of
rock
embedded
in
ice
orbiting
the
sun


each

a
<collocation>comet swings</collocation>

in
its

some
of
its
ice
vaporizes
and
will

spread
out
along
the
entire
orbit
of
the
comet
to
form
a
stream
also
known
as
a
<collocation>dust trail</collocation>


most
of
our
meteor
showers
are
the
product
of
rare
disintegrations
when
large
<collocation>chunks break</collocation>
off
a
mostly
<collocation>dormant comet</collocation>


examples
are
the
and


they
originated
from
a
breakup
of
objects
and
respectively
about
and
<collocation>years ago</collocation>


the
fragments
tend
to
fall
apart
quickly
into
dust
sand
and
pebbles
and
spread
out
along
the
orbit
of
the
comet
to
form
a
dense
stream
which
later
moves
into
earth
path


the
most

in

are
the
which
peak

each

at

about
every
years
the

produces
a

leonid

gave

cats
have
been
domesticated
tame
for
nearly
years


they
are
currently
the
most
popular
pets
in
the
world


their
origin
is
probably
the
<collocation>african wildcat</collocation>
felis


cats
were
probably
first
kept
because
they
ate
mice
and
this
is
still
their
main
job
in
farms
throughout
the
world


later
they
were
kept
because
they
are
friendly
and
good
companions


a
young
cat
is
called
a
kitten


cats
are
sometimes
called

felines
are
usually

history
past
range
of
felis


in
the
past
people
kept
cats
because
the
cats
hunted
and
ate
mice
rats
and
insects


the
oldest
evidence
of
cats
kept
as
pets
is
from
the
mediterranean
island
of
cyprus
around


ancient
egyptians
worshipped
cats
as
gods
and
often
mummified
them
so
they
could
be
with
their
owners
for
all
of
eternity


they
also
mummified
mice
so
the
cats
would
have
something
to
eat
in
the
afterlife


today
people
often
keep
cats
as
pets
but
there
are
also
cats
that
live
without
being
cared
for
by
people


these
kinds
of
cats
are
called
<collocation>feral cats</collocation>


today
special
food
for
cats
is
widely
available
in
the
developed
countries


proper
feeding
will
make
a
cat
live
much
longer
compared
to
hunting
or
being
fed
<collocation>table scraps</collocation>


not
correctly
feeding
a
cat
can
lead
to
problems
see
below
for
<collocation>health concerns</collocation>


cats
can
not
<collocation>taste sweet</collocation>
foods
with
sugar
because
of
a
mutation
change
in
their
ancestors
which
removed
the
ability
to
<collocation>taste sweet</collocation>
things


<collocation>cat anatomy</collocation>
cats
have
anatomy
similar
to
the
other
members
of
the
genus
felis


the
genus
has
<collocation>extra lumbar</collocation>
lower
back
and
thoracic
chest
vertebrae


this
helps
to
explain
the
cat
spinal
mobility
and
flexibility


unlike
human
arms
cat
are
attached
to
the
shoulder
by
<collocation>clavicle bones</collocation>


these
allow
cats
to
pass
their
body
through
any
space
into
which
they
can
fit
their
heads


the
cat
skull
is
unusual
among
mammals
in
having
very
large
<collocation>eye sockets</collocation>
and
a
powerful
and
specialized
jaw


compared
to
other
felines
domestic
cats
have
narrowly
spaced
canine
teeth
this
is
an
adaptation
to
their
preferred
prey
of
small
rodents


cats
like
dogs
walk
directly
on
their
toes
with
the
bones
of
their
feet
making
up
the
lower
part
of
the
visible
leg


cats
walk
very
precisely


unlike
most
mammals
when
cats
walk
they
use
a
pacing
gait
that
is
they
move
the
two
legs
on
one
side
of
the
body
before
the
legs
on
the
other
side


this
trait
is
shared
with
camels
and
giraffes


as
a
walk
speeds
up
into
a
trot
a
cat
gait
will
change
to
be
a
diagonal
gait
similar
to
that
of
most
other
mammals
the
diagonally
<collocation>opposite hind</collocation>
and
forelegs
will
move
at
the
same
time


most
cats
have
five
claws
on
their
<collocation>front paws</collocation>
and
four
on
their
rear
paws


on
the
inside
of
the
<collocation>front paws</collocation>
there
is
something
which
looks
like
a
sixth
finger


this
special
feature
on
the
inside
of
the
wrists
is
the
carpal
pad
also
found
on
other
cats
and
on
dogs


behaviour
the
cat
on
the
right
is
fed
up
with
the
cat
on
the
left
and
this
is
a
warning


the
stripes
on
this
<collocation>standard tabby</collocation>
cat
help
it
hide
in
long
grass
and
bushes


it
a
kind
of
camouflage


cats
are
active
carnivores
meaning
they
hunt
live
prey


their
main
prey
is
small
mammals
like
mice


they
will
also
stalk
and
sometimes
kill
and
eat
birds


cats
eat
a
wide
variety
of
prey
including
insects
and
seem
especially
to
like
house
flies
and


their
main
method
of
hunting
is
stalk
and
pounce


while
dogs
have
<collocation>great stamina</collocation>
and
will
<collocation>chase prey</collocation>
over
long
distances
cats
are
extremely
fast
but
only
over
short
distances


the
basic
cat
coat
coloring
tabby
see
top
photo
gives
it
good
camouflage
in
grass
and
woodland


the
cat
creeps
towards
a
chosen
victim
keeping
its
body
flat
and
near
to
the
ground
so
that
it
can
not
be
seen
easily
until
it
is
close
enough
for
a
rapid
dash
or
pounce


cats
especially
kittens
practice
these
instinctive
behaviors
in
play
with
each
other
or
on
small
toys


cats
are
quiet
and
animals
making
them
popular
pets


young
kittens
are
playful


they
can
easily
entertain
themselves
with
a
variety
of
or
homemade
toys


house
cats
have
also
been
known
to
teach
themselves
to
use
doorknobs
and
toilet
handles


cats
are
fairly
independent
animals


they
can
look
after
themselves
and
do
not
need
as
much
attention
as
dogs
do


communication
cats
use
many
different
sounds
for
communication
including
meowing
purring
trilling
hissing
growling
squeaking
chirping
clicking
and
grunting


<collocation>body posture</collocation>
is
also
important


the
whole
shape
of
the
body
changes
when
a
cat
is
relaxed
or
when
it
is
alert


also
the
position
of
their
ears
and
tail
are
used
for
communication
as
well
as
their
usual
functions


these
ways
of
communication
are
very
important


they
are
used
between
a
mother
cat
and
her
kittens


they
are
also
used
between
male
and
female
cats
and
between
cats
and
other
species
such
as
dogs


a
mother
cat
protecting
her
kittens
will
fight
off
the
largest
dog


she
gives
good
warning
with
a
<collocation>frightening display</collocation>
hissing
furiously
showing
her
claws
arching
her
back
and
making
her
hair
stand
on
end


if
that
fails
she
attacks
the
dog
face
with
her
claws


it
has
been
said
that
no
dog
ever
tries
such
an
attack
a
second
time


<collocation>mating cats</collocation>
only
mate
when
the
queen
is
in
heat


heat
periods
occur
about
every
two
weeks
and
last
to
days


mating
in
cats
is
a
spectacular
event


<collocation>several toms</collocation>
may
be
attracted
to
a
queen
in
heat


the
males
will
fight
over
her
and
the
<collocation>victor wins</collocation>
the
right
to
mate


at
first
the
female
will
reject
the
male
but
eventually
the
female
will
allow
the
male
to
mate


the
female
will
utter
a
loud
yowl
as
the
male
pulls
out
of
her


this
is
because
a
male
cat
penis
has
a
band
of
about
spines
which
are
about
one
millimeter
long
upon
withdrawal
of
the
penis
the
spines
rake
the
walls
of
the
female
vagina
which
is
a
trigger
for
ovulation


after
mating
the
female
will
wash
her
vulva
thoroughly


if
a
male
attempts
to
breed
with
her
at
this
point
the
female
will
attack
him


after
about
to
minutes


once
the
female
is
finished
grooming
the
cycle
will
repeat


because
ovulation
is
not
always
triggered
females
may
not
get
pregnant
by
the
first
tom
which
mates
with
them


a
queen
may
mate
with
more
than
one
tom
when
she
is
in
heat
and
different
kittens
in
a
litter
may
have
different
fathers


the
cycle
ceases
when
the
queen
is
pregnant


the
<collocation>gestation period</collocation>
for
cats
is
about
two
months
with
an
average
length
of
days


the
size
of
a
litter
is
usually
three
to
five
kittens


kittens
are
weaned
at
between
six
and
seven
weeks
and
cats
normally
reach
<collocation>sexual maturity</collocation>
at
months
females
and
to
months
males


females
can
have
two
to
three
litters
per
year
so
might
produce
up
to
kittens
in
their
breeding
life
of
about
ten
years


birth
and
after
pregnant
queens
deliver
their
litters
by
themselves
guided
by
instinct


the
queen
finds
the
safest
place
she
can


then
she
will
clean
it
thoroughly
with
her
tongue
if
necessary


here
she
will
quietly
give
birth


she
licks
the
newborn
<collocation>kits clean</collocation>


in
the
wild
leaving
a
scent
is
risking
a
dangerous
encounter
with
other
animals


the
kits
are
born
blind
and
with
closed
eyes


they
suckle
on
her
teats
and
sleep
a
good
deal


after
two
weeks
or
so
their
eyes
open


at
that
stage
they
have
hair
and
blue
eyes


a
bit
later
the
best
developed
kit
will
totter
out
of
the
nest


the
others
follow


they
will
soon
recognize
you
as
a
living
thing
that
is
a
great
moment


at
first
they
go
back
to
the
nest
to
feed
and
sleep


after
some
more
days
they
leave
the
nest
for
good
but
still
they
may
sleep
together
in
a
kitten
heap


the
queen
meanwhile
has
left
the
nest
from
time
to
time
to
hunt
feed
and
also
to
urinate
and
defecate


unlike
the
tom
she
covers
up
her
business
to
hide
her
scent


very
soon
the
kits
will
urinate
anywhere
they
please
unless
one
trains
them


this
is
done
after
they
are
weaned
when
they
are
ready
for
some
kitten
food


here
is
how
to
do
it


prepare
clean
cat
tray
filled
with
absorbent
grit


give
kittens
their
special
kitten
food


take
the
lead
kitten
right
after
it
has
eaten
place
it
in
your
cat
tray


gently
stroke
its
tummy
with
one
finger


watch
as
kitten
sits
down
promptly
and
urinates


do
same
for
other
kits


repeat
next
time
if
they
need
it


they
will
not
need
a
third
time


what
you
have
done
is
exactly
what
the
queen
would
do
in
the
wild


you
have
triggered
a
reflex
which
all
kittens
have


the
thing
is
the
tray
is
artificial
and
your
queen
may
do
her
business
outside


but
at
least
when
young
kittens
need
a
tray


your
next
job
is
to
call
the
vet
who
will
tell
you
when
to
bring
the
kits
for
their
vaccination


kitten
with
<collocation>string kittens</collocation>
play
endlessly


it
is
how
they
do
their
learning


they
will
play
their
favorite
games
such
as
hide
and
pounce
with
almost
anyone
or
anything


<collocation>soft balls</collocation>
on
strings
are
a
standard
toy
so
is
a
scratching
post


with
cats
there
is
a
limit
to
how
far
you
can
train
them


they
are
at
least
as
intelligent
as
dogs
but
they
are
not
pack
animals


they
like
to
do
their
own
thing
and
owners
do
best
by
fitting
in


never
hit
a
cat
if
you
do
the
relationship
will
never
be
the
same
again


if
you
really
want
to
dissuade
them
try
hissing


also
a
noise
they
do
not
like
will
make
them
leave


it
has
been
said
that
no
one
really
owns
a
cat
many
cats
collect
extra
owners
and
may
change
house
if
they
do
not
like
the
treatment
if
your
kitten
was
born
in
your
home
do
not
let
it
out
of
the
house
until
it
is
two
to
three
months
old


if
you
have
the
mother
she
will
look
after
the
kit


but
if
you
have
got
the
kit
from
a
vet
or
dealer
keep
it
in
for
several
weeks


when
it
does
go
out
you
need
to
watch
over
it


the
main
problem
is
that
it
may
easily
get
lost


in
time
the
kit
will
learn
every
inch
of
the
house
and
garden


then
you
can
happily
let
it
roam


grooming
cats
are
very
clean
animals


they
groom
themselves
by
licking
their
fur


the
cat
tongue
can
act
as
a
hairbrush
and
can
clean
and
untangle
a
cat
fur


still
owners
may
buy
grooming
products
to
help
the
cat
take
care
of
itself


after
licking
their
fur
cats
sometimes
get
hairballs


a
hairball
is
a
small
amount
of
fur
that
is
vomited
up
by
animals
when
it
becomes
too
big


this
is
quite
normal


owners
brush
their
cats
to
try
to
prevent
a
lot
of
hairballs


food
a
typical
brown
burmese
cat
many
house
cats
eat
food
which
their
owners
give
them


this
food
is
manufactured
and
designed
to
contain
the
right
nutrients
for
cats


there
are
many
different
types
of
cat
food


these
come
in
many
different
flavors
and
costs
are
often
very
small


there
is
moist
canned
food
and
also
dry
cat
food
which
comes
in
different
sized
cans
or
bags
and
formulas


there
are
<collocation>kitten formulas</collocation>
cat
formulas
health
formulas
formulas
for
reducing
a
cat
weight
and
many
others


these
can
even
be
organic
made
from
all
natural
ingredients
and
have
vegetables
salmon
tuna
meat
and
milk
essence


yet
it
best
if
the
food
is
at
least
meat
as
that
a
cat
diet


also
make
sure
the
cat
is
not
fed
a
daily
diet
of
dog
food


it
could
make
the
cat
blind
as
it
has
no
which
is
a
nutrient
for
the
eyes


<collocation>health concerns</collocation>
a
very
young
kitten


this
kitten
has
been
taken
out
of
the
nest
for
a
photo
its
eyes
are
just
open
but
it

kittens
growing
up
cats
do
get
diseases
and
prevention
is
better
than
cure


it
is
most
important
to
get
a
young
cat
vaccinated
against
some
of
the
most
deadly
diseases


if
a
cat
gets
a
disease
a
veterinarian
animal
doctor
can
offer
help


some
cats
depending
on
breed
gender
age
and
general
health
may
be
more
susceptible
to
disease
than
others


regular
visits
to
a
vet
can
keep
a
cat
alive
many
extra
years
by
catching
sickness
and
disease
early


cats
that
roam
outside
will
get
fleas
at
some
time


<collocation>cat fleas</collocation>
will
not
live
on
people
but
fleas
will
not
hesitate
to
bite
anyone
nearby


owners
may
choose
to
buy
collars
but
any
areas
where
the
cat
normally
sleeps
need
to
be
cleaned
up


a
vet
or
local
may
offer
advice
about
fleas


it
is
recommended
that
people
quickly
take
action
when
a
cat
gets
fleas
because
fleas
can
make
<collocation>cats uncomfortable</collocation>


house
cats
can
become
overweight
through
lack
of
exercise
and


when
they
get
spayed
or
neutered
fixed
they
tend
to
exercise
less


spaying
is
done
for
queens
and
neutering
is
done
for
toms


it
is
important
to
fix
cats
and
here
are
some
reasons


first
of
all
if
a
female
cat
has
kittens
they
will
need
homes
