others

the

enjoy

some

the

drainage
basin
is
a
geographic
term
about
rivers


it
is
an
area
of
land


all
water
that
falls
on
the
watershed
flows
into
one
river


it
can
flow
directly
into
the
river
or
go
through
tributaries
smaller
rivers
that
flow
into
the
bigger
river
first


the
watershed
of
a
river
can
be
very
large


for
example
the
watershed
of
the
mississippi
river
covers
more
than
half
of
the

that
means
that
over
half
of

mythology
a
myth
is
a
story
that
may
or
may
not
be
true


the
definition
of
the
word
myth
is
still
subject
to
debate


myths
may
be
very
old
or
new
for
example
urban
myths


there
may
not
be
records
or
other
proof
that
they
happened
but
at
least
some
parts
of
myths
may
be
true


we
know
about
them
from
older
people
telling
them
to
younger
people


some
myths
may
have
started
as
true
stories
but
as
people
told
and
them
they
may
have
changed
some
parts
so
they
are
less
true


they
may
have
changed
them
by
mistake
or
to
make
them
more
interesting


all
cultures
have
myths


stories
about
the
greek
and
roman
gods
and
goddesses
are
myths


many
people
once
believed
in
mythological
animals
and
gods


these
animals
or
gods
may
have
control
or
has
power
over
a
part
of
human
or
natural
life


for
example
the
greek
god
named
zeus
had
powers
over
lightning
and
storms


<collocation>whenever zeus</collocation>
wanted
to
he
could
make
a
storm
and
that
he
made
storms
to
show
his
anger


another
example
is
that
of
the
egyptian
god
who
was
said
to
be
the
creator
of
everything
in
the
world


in
hindu
mythology
the
cause
of
thunderstorms
was
said
to
be
the
wrath
of
the
chief
of
all
gods


his
most
powerful
weapon
was
the
or
thunderbolt


it
was
said
that
no
one
could
survive
after
an
attack
from
this
weapon

mythology
includes
the
legends
of
their
history
their
religions
their
stories
of
how
the
world
was
created
and
their
heroes


these
stories
have
great
symbolic

reason
why
they

as
long
as
they
do
sometimes

a
collection
of
myths
is
called
a
mythos
the
roman
mythos


a
collection
of
those
is
called
a
the
greek
and
roman


one
important
type
of
myth
is
the
creation
myth
which
describes
how
that
culture
believes
the
universe
or
world
was
created


scientists
generally
believe
that
the
universe
was
created
in
an
event
called
the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
a
natural
event


but
now
there
is
talk
within
the
scientific
community
about
what
existed
before
the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>


to
those
are
comfortable
with
the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
as
the
ultimate
or
only
solution
to
the
question
of
the
beginning
of
the
universe
the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
may
have
itself
become
a
myth


not
so
<collocation>long ago</collocation>
the
milky
way
was
believed
to
be
the
only
galaxy
scientists
then
had
trouble
accepting
other
competing
theories
or
ideas


myths
are
often
final
answers
with
great
authority
and
strong
<collocation>emotional ties</collocation>


another
important
and
myth
common
to
many
cultures
is
the
trickster
myth


a
trickster
is
a
god
or
hero
and
very
often
an
animal
who
plays
tricks
or
jokes
on
humans
in
order
to
bring
them
wisdom
or
help
them
question
their
beliefs


examples
of
tricksters
include
the
fox
in
europe
the
crow
and
the
coyote
for
north
american
natives
the
spider
in
jamaica


there

joseph
campbell
was
considered
by
some
people
to
be
a
leading
western
authority
on
myth
and
the
history
of
spirituality


historians
views
on
myths
although
myths
are
often
considered
to
be
stories
of
events
that
have
not
happened
many
historians
think
myths
are
about
actual
events
that
have
become
connected
with
strong
symbolic
meaning
or
that
have
been
changed
or
shifted
in
time
or
place
or
even
reversed


one
way
of
thinking
about
this
process
is
to
imagine
myths
as
lying
at
the
far
end
of
an
imaginary
line


at
one
end
of
the
line
is
dispassionate
account
and
<collocation>legendary occurrence</collocation>
or
mythical
status
is
near
the
other
end


as
an
event
progresses
toward
the
mythical
end
of
this
line
or
continuum
the
way
people
think
feel
and
say
about
the
event
changes


it
may
gain
greater
<collocation>historical significance</collocation>
while
the
facts
become
less
important


by
the
time
one
arrives
at
the
mythical
end
of
the
line
the
story
has
taken
on
a
life
of
its
own
and
the
facts
of
the
original
event
have
become
almost
unimportant


this
happens
partly
because
the
events
described
are
taken
away
from
their
original
situation
and
put
in
a
new
situation
often
because
it
is
similar
to
things
happening
at
the
moment


some
greek
myths
originated
in
classical
times
to
provide
reasons
for
local
cult
practices
to
account
for
the
local
name
of
one
of
the
olympian
gods
to
describe
people
things
that
happened
to
say
why
a
deities
has
certain
features
or
and
sometimes
to
make
sense
of
ancient
icons


on
the
other
hand
descriptions
of
recent
events
are
made
to
seem
to
be
like
the
more
commonly
known
story


this
idea
has
been
used
by
conservatives
in
america
with
text
from
the
bible
revelation
and
was
used
in
the
russian
communist
era
in
propaganda
political
lies
about
situations
with
misleading
links
to
struggles
between
the
classes


even
today
the
fitness
of
the
emperor
of
japan
is
based
partly
on
his
distant
descent
from
the
goddess
of
the
sun


other
uses
myths
are
not
the
same
as
fables
folktales
fairy
tales
anecdotes
or
simple
fiction
but
sloppy
usage
has
blurred
the
distinctions
in
many
people
minds


the
term
myth
is
sometimes
used
pejoratively
in
reference
to
common
beliefs
of
a
culture
or
for
the
beliefs
of
a
religion
to
imply
that
the
story
is
both
fanciful
and
fictional


the
terms
urban
myth
and
urban
legend
are
sometimes
used
to
describe
something
that
is
false
but
strictly
speaking
those
can
be
either
true
or
false
as
well
