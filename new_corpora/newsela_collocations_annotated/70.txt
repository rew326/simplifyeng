the
formation
and
evolution
of
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
began
billion
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
with
the
gravitational
collapse
of
a
small
part
of
a
giant
molecular
cloud


most
of
the
collapsing
mass
collected
in
the
center
forming
the
sun
while
the
rest
flattened
into
a
disk
of
loose
dust
out
of
which
the
planets
moons
asteroids
and
other
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
bodies
formed


this
widely
accepted
model
known
as
the
hypothesis
was
first
developed
in
the
century
by
kant
and


its
subsequent
development
has
interwoven
a
variety
of
scientific
disciplines
including
astronomy
physics
geology
and
planetary
science


as
our
knowledge
of
space
has
grown
the
models
have
been
changed
to
account
for
the
new
observations


the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
has
evolved
considerably
since
its
initial
formation


many
moons
have
formed
from
circling
discs
of
gas
and
dust
around
their
parent
planets
while
other
moons
are
believed
to
have
formed
independently
and
later
been
captured
by
their
planets


still
others
as
the
earth
moon
may
be
the
result
of
<collocation>giant collisions</collocation>


many
collisions
between
bodies
have
occurred
and
have
been
important
to
the
evolution
of
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>


the
positions
of
the
planets
often
shifted
and
planets
have
switched
places


this
<collocation>planetary migration</collocation>
is
thought
to
have
been
responsible
for
much
of
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
early
evolution


earth
orbit
the
earth
orbit
around
the
sun
is
nearly
a
perfect
circle
but
when
mapped
it
is
found
that
the
earth
moves
around
the
sun
in
a
very
slightly
oval
shaped
called
an
<collocation>elliptical orbit</collocation>


the
other
planets
in
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
also
circle
the
sun
in
slightly
<collocation>elliptical orbits</collocation>


mercury
has
a
more
<collocation>elliptical orbit</collocation>
than
the
others
and
some
of
the
smaller
objects
orbit
the
sun
in
very
eccentric
orbits


discovery
and
exploration
main
history
of
astronomy
for
thousands
of
years
people
had
no
need
for
a
name
for
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>


they
thought
the
earth
stayed
still
at
the
center
of
everything


although
the
greek
philosopher
of
suggested
that
there
was
a
special
order
in
the
sky
copernicus
was
the
first
to
develop
a
mathematical
system
that
described
what
we
now
call
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>


this
was
called
a
new
system
of
the
world


in
the
century
galileo
galilei
johannes
and
<collocation>isaac newton</collocation>
began
helping
people
understand
physics
more
clearly


this
made
people
slowly
accept
the
idea
that
the
earth
is
a
planet
and
moves
around
the
sun
and
that
the
planets
are
worlds
with
the
same
physical
laws
that
control
earth


more
recently
telescopes
and
spacecraft
have
led
to
discoveries
of
mountains
and
craters
and
seasonal
meteorological
phenomena
such
as
clouds
dust
storms
and

it
took
people
many
years
of
looking
carefully
through
telescopes
to
find
the
objects
that
were
farthest
away


no
one
expects
to
find
new
planets
but
more
small
objects
are
found
every
year


most
of
the
planets
have
moons
that
orbit
around
them
just

had
been
called

in

meeting
at

union
decided
on
the

instead
they

saturn
is
an
oblate
meaning
that

saturn
has
a
flattened

it
is
due
to
its

rotating
once
every

saturn
is
the
only
planet
in

that
is
less

even
though
the
planet
core
is
very
dense
it
has
a
gaseous
atmosphere
so
the
average
specific
density
of
the
planet
is
less
than
the

this
means
if
saturn
could
be
placed
in
a
large
pool
of
water
it
would
float


atmosphere
the
outer

of
saturn
atmosphere

interior
saturn
interior
is
similar
to
jupiter
interior


it
has
a
small
rocky
core
about
the
size
of
the
earth
at
its
center


it
is
very
hot
its
temperature
reaches

saturn
is
so
hot
that
it
gives
out
more
heat
energy
into
space
than
it
receives
from
the
sun


above
it
is
a
thicker
layer
of
metallic
hydrogen
about
convert
km
mi
off
on

above
that
layer
is
a
region
of

the
core
is
heavy
with
about
to
times
more
mass
than
the
earth
core


magnetic
field
saturn
has
a
natural
magnetic
field
that
is
weaker
than
jupiter


like
the
earth
saturn
field
is
a
magnetic


saturn
field
is
unique
in
that
it
is
perfectly
symmetrical
unlike
any
other
known
planet


this
means
the
field
is
exactly
in
line
with
the
planet
axis


saturn
generates
radio
waves
but
they
are
too
weak
to
be
detected
from
earth


the
moon
titan
orbits
in

rotation
and
orbit
saturn
average
distance
from
the
sun
is
over
km
mi
about
nine
times
the
distance
from
the
earth
to
the
sun


it
takes
days
or
about
years
for
saturn
to
orbit
around
the
sun


this
is
known
as
saturn
orbital
period


voyager
measured
saturn
rotation
as
being
hours
minutes
at
the
equator
hours
minutes
closer
to
the
poles
and
hours
minutes
seconds
for
the

interior


this
is
known
as
its
rotational
period


measured
the
rotation
of
saturn
as
being

seconds


that
is
about
six
minutes
or
one
percent
longer
than
the
radio
rotational
period
measured
by
the
voyager
and
voyager
spacecraft
which
flew
by
saturn
in
and


saturn
rotational
period
is
calculated
by
the
rotation
speed
of
radio
waves
released
by
the
planet


the
spacecraft
discovered
that
the
radio
waves
slowed
down
suggesting
that
the
rotational
period
increased


since
the
scientists
do
not
think
saturn
rotation
is
actually
slowing
down
the
explanation
may
lie
in
the
magnetic
field
that
causes
the
radio
waves


planetary
rings

from
the
planet


from
the
planet
the
rings
are
d
c
b
a
f
g
and
scientists
believe
that
the
rings
are
the
material
left
after
a
moon
broke
apart


a
new
idea
says
that
it
was
a
very
large
moon
most
of
which
crashed
into
the
planet


this
left
a
large
amount
of
ice
to
form
the
rings
and
also
some
of
the
moons
like
which
are
thought
to
be
made
of
ice


history
the
rings
were
first
discovered
by
galileo
galilei
in
using
his
telescope


they
did
not
look
like
rings
to
galileo
so
he
called
them
handles


he
thought
that
saturn
was
three
separate
planets
that
almost
touched
one
another


in
when
the
rings
were
facing
edge
on
with
the
earth
the
rings
disappeared
then
reappeared
again
in
further
confusing
galileo


in
was
the
first
person
to
recognize
saturn
was
surrounded
by
rings


using
a
much
more
powerful
telescope
than
galilei
he
noted
saturn
is
surrounded
by
a
thin
flat
ring
nowhere
touching


in
discovered
that
the
planet
rings
were
in
fact
made
of
smaller
ringlets
with
gaps


the
largest
ring
gap
was
later
named
the
division


in
james
clerk
maxwell
showed
that
the
rings
can
not
be
solid
but
are
made
of
small
particles
each
orbiting
saturn
on
their
own
otherwise
it
would
become
unstable
or
break
apart


james
keeler
studied
the
rings
using
a
spectroscope
in
which
proved
maxwell
theory


<collocation>physical features</collocation>
the
rings
range
from
convert
km
mi
off
on
to
convert
km
mi
off
on
above
the
planet
equator


as
proved
by
maxwell
even
though
the
rings
appear
to
be
solid
and
unbroken
when
viewed
from
above
the
rings
are
made
of
small
particles
of
rock
and
ice


they
are
only
about
convert
m
ft
off
on
thick
made
of
silica
rock
iron
oxide
and
ice
particles


the
smallest
particles
are
only
specks
of
dust
while
the
largest
are
the
size
of
a
house


the
c
and
d
rings
also
seem
to
have
a
wave
in
them
like
waves
in
water


these
large
waves
are
convert
m
ft
off
on
high
but
only
moving
slowly
at
about
convert
m
ft
off
on
each
day


some
scientists
believe
that
the
wave
is
caused
by
saturn
moons


another
idea
is
the
waves
were
made
by
a
comet
hitting
saturn
in
or


the
largest
gaps
in
the
rings
are
the
division
and
the
division
both
visible
from
the
earth


the
division
is
the
largest
measuring
convert
km
mi
off
on
wide


however
when
the
<collocation>voyager spacecrafts</collocation>
visited
saturn
in
they
discovered
that
the
rings
are
a
complex
structure
made
out
of
thousands
of
thin
gaps
and
ringlets


scientist
believe
this
is
caused
by
the
gravitational
force
of
some
of
saturn
moons


the
tiny
moon
pan
orbits
inside
saturn
rings
creating
a
gap
within
the
rings


other
ringlets
keep
their
structure
due
to
the
gravitational
force
of
shepherd
satellites
such
as
prometheus
and
pandora


other
gaps
form
due
to
the
gravitational
force
of
a
large
moon
farther
away


the
moon
is
responsible
for
clearing
away
the
gap


recent
data
from
the
spacecraft
has
shown
that
the
rings
have
their
own
atmosphere
free
from
the
planet
atmosphere


the
rings
atmosphere
is
made
of
oxygen
gas
and
it
is
produced
when
the
sun
ultraviolet
light
breaks
up
the
water
ice
in
the
rings


chemical
reaction
also
occurs
between
the
ultraviolet
light
and
the
water
molecules
creating
hydrogen
gas


the
oxygen
and
hydrogen
atmospheres
around
the
rings
are
very
widely
spaced


as
well
as
oxygen
and
hydrogen
gas
the
rings
have
a
thin
atmosphere
made
of
hydroxide


this
anion
was
discovered
by
the
<collocation>hubble space</collocation>
telescope


spokes
the
spokes
in
saturn
rings
photographed
by
voyager
the
voyager
space
probe
discovered
features
shaped
like
rays
called
spokes


these
were
also
seen
later
by
the
hubble
telescope


the
probe
photographed
the
spokes
in


they
are
seen
as
dark
when
under
sunlight
and
appear
light
when
against
the
<collocation>unlit side</collocation>


at
first
it
was
thought
the
spokes
were
made
of
microscopic
dust
particles
but
new
evidence
shows
that
they
are
made
of
ice


they
rotate
at
the
same
time
with
the
planet
magnetosphere
therefore
it
is
believed
that
they
have
a
connection
with
electromagnetism


however
what
cause
the
spokes
to
form
is
still
unknown


they
appear
to
be
seasonal
disappearing
during
solstice
and
appearing
again
during
equinox


moons
saturn
has
named
moons
and
another
nine
which
are
still
being
studied


many
of
the
moons
are
very
small
are
less
than
convert
km
mi
off
on
in
diameter
and
moons
are
less
than
convert
km
mi
off
on


seven
moons
are
large
enough
to
be
a
near
perfect
sphere
caused
by
their
own
gravitation


these
moons
are
titan
rhea
and


titan
is
the
largest
moon
larger
than
the
planet
mercury
and
it
is
the
only
moon
in
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
to
have
a
thick
dense
atmosphere


hyperion
and
phoebe
are
the
next
largest
moons
larger
than
convert
km
mi
off
on
in
diameter


in
december
and
january
a
satellite
called
the
probe
took
lots
of
close
photos
of
titan


one
part
of
this
satellite
known
as
the
probe
then
landed
on
titan


named
after
the
dutch
astronomer
it
was
the
first
spacecraft
to
land
in
the
<collocation>outer solar</collocation>
system


the
probe
was
designed
to
float
in
case
it
landed
in
water


the
sixth
largest
moon
is
about
convert
km
mi
off
on
in
diameter
