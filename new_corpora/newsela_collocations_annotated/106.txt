of
russia
history
began
when
the
east
slavs
formed
a
group
in
europe
between
the
and
centuries
ad


the
vikings
and
their
descendants
founded
the
first
east
slavic
state
of
in
the
century


they
adopted
christianity
from
the
byzantine
empire
in


this
form
of
christianity
influenced
russian
culture
greatly


eventually
broke
up
and
the
lands
were
divided
into
many
small
feudal
states


the
most
powerful
successor
state
to
was
the
<collocation>grand duchy</collocation>
of
moscow


this
area
served
as
the
main
force
in
later
russian
unification
and
the
fight
against
the
<collocation>golden horde</collocation>
from
asia


moscow
slowly
gained
control
of

ways

the
great
began
building
ships
for
the
russian
navy


the
war
started
in
and
ended
in

winning
the
war


the
russian
defeat
was
one
of

reasons
for
later

later
called
communists
influenced
by
the
ideas
of
marx
and
lenin
took

destroyed
anything
that
was
against
him
ruling
including
taking
the
property
of
farmers
and
shopkeepers

millions
of
people
to
starve
and
die

also
removed
