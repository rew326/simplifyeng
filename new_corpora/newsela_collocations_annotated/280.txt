david
may
august
was
a
philosopher
and
historian
from
scotland


when
he
was
still
alive
people
thought
of
him
as
a
historian


he
wrote
a
series
of
large
books
called
the
history
of
england


but
today
people
think
of
as
an
important
philosopher


in
his
books
on
philosophy
said
that
many
of
our
beliefs
do
not
come
from
reason


instead
they
come
from
our
instincts
or
feelings


for
example
reason
does
not
tell
us
that
one
thing
causes
another


instead
we
see
one
thing
and
then
we
see
another
and
we
feel
a
link
between
the
two


similarly
reason
does
not
tell
us
that
someone
is
a
good
person


instead
we
see
that
the
person
is
kind
and
friendly
and
we
feel
a
special
moral
feeling


because
thought
that
these
beliefs
do
not
come
from
reason
people
call
him
a
skeptical
or
philosopher


was
also
skeptical
about
religion


he
was
not
a
religious
person
and
religious
people
did
not
like
his
opinions


he
did
not
believe
in
miracles


he
said
that
suicide
was
sometimes
ok


but
never
said
if
he
believed
in
god


in
when
he
was
dying
he
was
very
nice
to
his
friends
and
very
calm
about
death


many
people
were
amazed
about
this
because
they
thought
was
going
to
hell


today
books
are
very
important
to
philosophers
who
are
interested
in
religion


today
philosophers
sometimes
use
the
term
fork
to
refer
to
calling
everything
we
can
think
about
either
a
relation
of
ideas
like
math
or
a
matter
of
fact
like
science
or
history

thomas
april
december
was
a
philosopher
from
england


his
most
famous
book
is
leviathan


mainly
wrote
about
government
and
law
he
was
a
political
philosopher


he
tried
to
show
that
the
best
kind
of
government
has
one
sovereign
of
one
man
or
an
assembly
of
men
with
total
power


but
the
most
interesting
thing
about
was
the
way
he
argued


he
started
by
looking
at
human
nature


he
said
that
humans
are
very
selfish
and
that
we
are
willing
to
hurt
each
other
if
we
think
it
will
help
us


he
also
said
that
naturally
humans
are
all
equal
because
we
are
all
strong
enough
to
kill
each
other
even
a
child
can
kill
a
strong
man
while
he
sleeps


then
he
imagined
what
things
would
be
like
without
a
government


he
said
that
it
would
be
terrible
a
state
of
war


there
would
not
be
enough
stuff
for
everyone
and
people
would
disagree
about
who
got
what


some
people
would
fight
each
other
and
everyone
else
would
be
very
worried
about
their
own
safety


no
one
would
be
able
to
trust
anyone
else
or
make
plans
for
the
future


life
would
be
solitary
poor
nasty
brutish
and
short
people
would
be
alone
poor
mean
and
would
not
live
for
long


next
argues
that
it
would
be
a
<collocation>good idea</collocation>
for
everyone
to
stop
fighting
and
choose
a
sovereign
which
could
be
one
man
or
an
assembly
of
men


everyone
should
agree
to
obey
the
sovereign
and
give
him
all
power
of
coercion
or
force
of
restraint
under
law


once
the
sovereign
is
in
place
everyone
has
to
obey
him
even
those
who
disagree
with
him


this
is
because
everyone
already
agreed
to
obey
him
no
matter
what


says
it
better
to
be
mostly
safe
under
an
sovereign
than
to
be
in
a
state
of
war


wanted
his
argument
to
be
like
math
with
each
step
leading
to
the
next


but
many
people
disagreed
with
his
argument


some
said
that
was
in
favor
of
rebellion
because
he
said
that
people
were
naturally
equal


others
said
that
humans
are
not
as
selfish
as
thought


today
most
people
do
not
like
the
idea
of
an
government


but
argument
was
a
very
important
one
