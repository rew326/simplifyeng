these
games
imply

baby
are
separate
characters
but
those
games
are
considered
to
be
outside
the

of
the

more
recently
he

in

baby
appeared
via

abilities
during
the
development
of
<collocation>donkey kong</collocation>
was
known
as


jumping
both
to
access
places
and
as
an
offensive
move
is
a
common
element
in
games
especially
the
super


most
commonly
portrayed
form
of
attack
is
jumping
to
stomp
on
the
heads
of
enemies
first
used
in


this
move
may
entirely
crush
smaller
enemies
on
the
stage
and
usually
deals
damage
to
larger
ones
sometimes
also
causing
secondary
effects


this
attack
often
enables
to
knock
the
into
their
shells
which
can
slide
into
and
damage
other
enemies
or


subsequent
games
have
elaborated
on
abilities


super
world
added
the
ability
to
which
allows
to
break
blocks
beneath
him


later
the
<collocation>game boy</collocation>
version
of
<collocation>donkey kong</collocation>
allows
to
jump
higher
with
<collocation>consecutive jumps</collocation>
and
perform
a


in
super
has
several
jumping
abilities
such
as
a
sideways
somersault
a
ground
pound
which
makes
hit
the
ground
under
him
hard
and
the
wall
kick
which
propels
him
upwards
by
kicking
off
walls


uses
many
items
which
give
him
various
powers


the
one
that
shows
up
the
most
often
is
the
super
mushroom
which
allows
to
grow
to
twice
his
size
becoming
super
after
the
name
of
the
series
and
can
take
a
hit
before
shrinking
back
down
to
regular


if
super
collects
a
fire
flower
he
will
transform
into
fire
who
can
throw
fireballs
at
enemies


picking
up
a
makes
it
so
nothing
can
hurt
for
several
seconds


a
common
theme
in
the
series
is
the
fact
that
many
items
give
a
appearance
sometimes
related
to
the
item
itself
for
example
super
frog
suit
which
turns
into
a
frog
and
super
land
<collocation>power carrot</collocation>
which
transforms
into
a
rabbit


other
times
the
item
may
not
be
related
to
the
power
for
example
the
raccoon
leaf
gives
him
raccoon
ears
a
tail
and
the
power
of
flight


other
are
overall
more
useful
in
super
world
the
cape
allows
to
fly
and
glide
and
a
balloon
in
a
later
game
in
the
series
allows
similar
effects

of

these
basic
features

some
ideas
of
video
games
can
be
found
before
people
made


in

when
the
first
computers
began
to
be

three
people
had
some
ideas
to
create
the
basis
of
actual
video
games


in

of
electronics
tried

his

idea


even
if
his
idea
was
never
realized
he
is
the
first
man
to
have
thought
of
the
idea
of
video
games


later
in

a
