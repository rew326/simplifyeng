vacuum

were
used
in

which
demanded
lots
of

the
heat
produced


for
this
reason
when
the
transistor
became
cheaper
in
the
most
manufacturers
of
radios

began
using

a

the

scandinavia
is
a
group
of
countries
in
northern
europe
that
includes
norway
sweden
and
denmark


scandinavia
is
more
useful
as
a
linguistic
language
term
rather
than
geographic
however
because
it
also
refers
to
the
area
where
scandinavian
languages
also
called
the
north
germanic
languages
are
spoken


the
scandinavian
languages
swedish
norwegian
danish
icelandic

are
closely

scandinavians
are

geography
the
scandinavian
peninsula
is
a
large
peninsula
reaching
west
from
northern
europe
over
the
north
side
of
the
baltic
sea


norway
sweden
and
some
of
finland
are
on
the
peninsula
also
known
as


denmark
not
finland
however
is
regarded
as
part
of
scandinavia


this
is
because
danish
is
a
scandinavian
language
but
finnish
is
not


the
term
nordic
countries
is
sometimes
used
as
a
more
correct
geographical
term
but
the
nordic
countries
include
norway
sweden
denmark
including
the
islands
finland
and
iceland


these
five
countries
coordinate
political
and
cultural
activities
through
the
nordic
council


denmark
sweden
and
finland
are
also
members
of
the
european
union
but
only
finland
uses
the
euro
while
the
other
nordic
countries
still
use
their
own
currency
each
called
krone
or
crowns


norway
and
iceland
which
are
not
members
of
the
eu
are
members
of
nato


only
denmark
is
a
member
of
both
the
eu
and
nato


the
scandinavian
peninsula
is
sparsely
populated
and
covered
with
large
forests
of
pine
birch
and
spruce


the
western
and
northern
parts
are
mountainous
the
scandinavian
mountains
are
some
of
the
oldest
in
the
world


the
tallest
mountain
is
in
norway


denmark
km
is
the
smallest
of
the
scandinavian
countries


it
is
more
densely
populated
and
most
of
the
land
is
farmland


sweden
km
is
the
largest
of
the
scandinavian
countries


it
has
the
most
lakes
and
the
landscape
ranges
from
plains
in
the
south
to
mountains
in
the
west
along
the
border
with
norway
to
tundra
in
the
north


the
far
north
of
scandinavia
and
finland
is
called
lapland
where
the
people
live


some
of
them
still
<collocation>herd reindeer</collocation>
as
they
have
for
centuries
but
the
mostly
live
in
a
society
equal
to
that
of
other
scandinavians


people
the
stereotypes
of
scandinavian
people
relate
to
the
vikings
of
the
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>


the
vikings
from
sweden
are
best
known
as
traders
traveling
as
far
as
what
we
now
know
as
ukraine
and
starting
trade
routes
to
bring
goods
from
the
middle
east
to
scandinavia


the
vikings
from
norway
are
best
known
as
explorers
crossing
the
north
atlantic
in
their
and
settling
iceland
and
greenland


the
norwegian
explorers
even
reached
the
east
coast
of
what
we
now
call
canada
where
they
set
up
a
colony
but
it
only
lasted
a
few
years


the
vikings
from
denmark
however
left
the
biggest
mark
on
the
english


the
danish
raiders
attacked
england
repeatedly
and
brutally
demanding
payment
that
came
to
be
called
danish
gold
and
making
the
priests
and
bishops
of
churches
along
the
eastern
coast
england
say
and
write
down
the
famous
prayer
deliver
us
o
lord
from
the
wrath
of
the
norsemen


but
the
modern
stereotypes
of
the
vikings
actually
were
invented
much
later
in
the
century
when
richard
wagner
and
other
people
of
the
romantic
period
invented
descriptions
of
ancient
germanic
culture
in
the
opera
and
the
other
arts
often
showing
vikings
wearing
furs
and
winged
or
horned
helmets
and
drinking
from
large
horns


legend
the
most
common
usage
the
three
monarchies
denmark
norway
and
sweden
legend
an
extended
usage
including
finland
iceland
greenland
and
the
islands
finland
and
sweden
the
normal
meaning
of
the
name
scandinavia
is
denmark
norway
and
sweden
as
those
three
countries
are
on
or
near
the
scandinavia
peninsula


however
finland
and
iceland
are
sometimes
also
thought
of
as
part
of
scandinavia


the
people
of
scandinavia
do
not
consider
finland
and
iceland
to
be
scandinavian
countries
but
part
of
what
they
call
the
nordic
countries

there
with
its
pound
the
cheapest
car


in
the
years
after
the
fame
of
the
cars
was
rising
enormous


most
important
market
for
the
constructor
remained
however
england
that
took
the
biggest
part
of
the
production
followed
by
the
netherlands
and
france


from
minerva
got
a
worldwide
knight
licence


the
knight
motor
was
a
motor
without

developed
by
charles
y
knight
in
the
united

these
motors
were
extremely
silent


the
company

well
in
several
car
racing
competitions
in

amsterdam
where
they
kept

start
up
the
production
of
luxury
cars


the
<collocation>constructors star</collocation>
rose
in
the

as
well
american
politicians
and
industrials
liked
them
cars
as
well
even
henry
ford
had
before
the
already
one


the
car
had
the
same
qualities
as
the
rolls
but
was
a
little
cheaper


with
the
<collocation>economical crisis</collocation>
in
the
the
company
went
bankrupt
in


the
remains
were
taken
over
by
another
belgian
constructor
named


putted
the
name
minerva
on
their
cars
for
export
to
england
and
france
and
for
the
trucks
which
minerva
had
made
before
too


after
ii
the
company
produced
land
rovers
under
licence
for
the
belgian
army


production
of
these
drives
stopped
in


the
company
struggled
for
survival
and
made
some
land
cars
till


but
than
the
constructor
completely


nowadays
are
still
several
minerva
all
over
the
