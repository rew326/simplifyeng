i


was
born
in
a
poor
area
of


as
a
young
man
he
joined
a
small
group
who
wanted
the
slavs
in
the
south
of
to
join
with
serbia
in
a
new
country


they
called
themselves
young


a
group
of
powerful
people
in
serbia
decided
to
help
them


those
powerful
people
were
called
the
black
hand


they
gave
young
guns
and
small
bombs


when
they
heard
that
franz
was
coming
to
six
of
them
took
the
bombs
and
guns
and
waited
for
to
drive
past


they
were
going
to
kill
when
he
drove
past


every
one
of
them
failed


after
they
all
failed
went
to
a
cafe
to
buy
a
sandwich


when
came
out
of
the
cafe
he
saw
in
his
car


the
driver
of
the
car
had
driven
his
car
the
wrong
way
and
he
stalled
the
car
while
trying
to
turn


walked
up
and
shot


he
wanted
to
shoot
the
general
who
was
also
sitting
in
the
car
but
wife
threw
her
arms
around


she
was
in
the
way
and
shot
her
instead
of
the
general


at
his
trial
said
he
did
it
because
he
loved
his
people


the
austrians
thought
it
was
a
very
bad
crime
but
they
could
not
kill
him
because
he
was
only
years
old


the
law
in
said
only
people
older
than
could
be
killed
even
when
the
crime
was
as
bad
as
killing
royalty
like


they
said
must
stay
in
prison
for
years


during
his
time
in
the
prison
one
of
his
arms
was
amputated


he
died
in
prison
of
tuberculosis
and
blood
loss
in
the
year


because
this
crime
happened
gave
serbia
a
list
of
things
that
serbia
had
to
do
called
an
ultimatum
to
stop
things
like
this
from
happening
any
more


but
it
was
just
about
impossible
for
serbia
to
do
all
the
things
on
the
list
fast
enough
because
the
austrians
really
wanted
war
with
serbia


their
german
allies
also
wanted
a
big
war


this
led
to
many
of
the
european
countries
to
start

a

symbols


the
plural
of
formula
can
be
written
in
two
ways
formulae
or
formulas
the
choice
is
based
on
<collocation>personal preference</collocation>


formulas
use
letters
instead
of
words


a
simple
example
of
a
formula
is
y
x


here
if
x
is
for
example
then
y
x
so
y


possibly
the
most
famous
formula
is
e
m
c


albert
einstein
created
this


in
it
e
is
energy
m
is
mass
and
c
is
the
speed
of
light


thus
energy
mass
multiplied
by
the
speed
of
light
squared


the
multiplication
sign
is
usually
left
out
giving
e

the
formula
e
mc
is
also
an
equation


every
equation
is
a
formula
but
not
every
formula
is
an
equation


for
instance
the
formula
x
y
x
is
defined
as
y
is
not
an

no

used

form


the
term
conservative
came
to
be
used

a
reaction

the
neglect

the

caused
by
leisurely
interest
in

conservatism
tends
to
support
the
notion

faith
particularly
in

it
began
in
with
the

author
burke
book
reflections
on
the
revolution
in
france


in
his
book
he
advocated
for
being
satisfied
and
for

government

conservatives
seek
to
keep
things
as
they
are
while
others
want
a
return
to
the
way
things
were
at
an
earlier
time


a
conservative
party
in
england
formed
which
wanted
better
cooperation
between
rich
and
poor
democracy
and
somewhat
of
a
welfare
state
favored
by
conservatives
in
france
and
other

in
the

conservatives
were
suspicious
of
the

state
and
considered
businessmen

is
the
philosophy
of
knowledge


it
seeks
to
answer
the
questions
what
is
knowledge


and
how
is
knowledge
acquired


are
philosophers
who
are
interested
in
questions
such
as
whether
it
is
possible
to
have
knowledge
what
kind
of
knowledge
there
is
and
how
people
come
to
know
things


one
of
the
first
philosophers
to
make
a
clear
statement
on
these
questions
was


the
following
saying
was
and
still
is
famous
certain
truth
has
no
man
for
even
if
he
ever
succeeds
in
saying
what
is
true
he
will
never
know
it


this
is
an
early
kind
of
skepticism


some
positions
knowing
how
knowing
that
this
was
an
idea
of
gilbert


moral
questions
for
example
may
come
down
to
knowing
how
to
behave


science
could
be
about
knowing
that
something
is
the
case


rational
empirical
knowledge
rational
knowledge
if
it
exists
is
knowledge
built
up
from
a
person
internal
thought


empirical
knowledge
is
built
up
from
what
is
received
through
the
senses


error
knowledge
can
not
err
v
the
possibility
of
making
mistakes
is
an
essential
part
of
knowledge
