the
plan
called
for

to
be
taken
south
to
richmond
where
he
would
be
held
until
traded
for
confederate


booth
recruited
friends
and
known
for
his
mission
including
the
eight
persons
tried
by
the
military
commission


some
who
resisted
his
persuasive
efforts
such
as
actor
samuel
chester
became
key
government
witnesses
in
the
trial


on
march
booth
attended
lincoln
second
inauguration
as

met
at
a
restaurant
three
blocks
from

theatre
to
plan
the

heard
that

would
be
attending

matinee
performance
of
still
waters
run
deep
on
march
at
the
campbell
hospital
on

would
the
perfect
opportunity
for
a
kidnapping
and
according
to
john

developed
a
plan
to
intercept

plans
were
stopped
however
when
the
president
changed
his
plans
and
decided
instead
to
speak
to
the
indiana
regiment
and
present
a

next
plan
was
to
kidnap

performance
at

spoke
of
his
viewing
of
the
president
speech
with
booth
i
had
never
seen
lincoln
up
close
and
i
knew
he
was
a
tall
man
however
nothing
could
have
prepared
me
for
the
sight
of
him


a
long
shadow
did
he
have


and
his
arms
when
at
his
sides
touched
near
his
knees


very
professionally
he
said
that
there
would
never
be
any
suffrage
based
on
differences
in
the
way
people
look


upon
this

turned
to
