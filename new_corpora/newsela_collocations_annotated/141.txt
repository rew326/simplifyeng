photosynthesis
is
very
important
for
life
on
earth


most
plants
either
directly
or
indirectly
depend
on
it


the
exception
are
certain
organisms
that
directly
get
their
energy
from
chemical
reactions
these
organisms
are
called


photosynthesis
can
happen
in
different
ways
but
there
are
some
parts
that
are
common

of
a
photosynthesis
has
two
main
sets
of
reactions


reactions
need
light
to
work
and
reactions
which
do
not
need
light
to
work


reactions
main
reaction
light
energy
from
the
sun
is
used
to
split
water
which
has
been
sucked
in
by
plants
by


the
sunlight
hits
in
the
plant
causing
an
enzyme
to
break
apart
the
water


water
when
broken
makes
oxygen
hydrogen
and
electrons


the
hydrogen
converts
to
which
is
then
used
in
the
reactions


oxygen
diffuses
out
of
the
plant
as
a
waste
product
of
photosynthesis
and
is
synthesized
from
and
inorganic
phosphate


this
all
happens
in
the
of


reactions
main
reaction
during
this
reaction
sugars
are
built
up
using
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
and
the
products
of
the
reactions
and
and
various
other
chemicals
found
in
the
plant
in
the
calvin
cycle


therefore
the
reaction
can
not
happen
without
the
reaction


<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
diffuses
into
the
plant
and
along
with
chemicals
in
the
of
the
and
and
glucose
is
made
and
finally
transported
around
the
plant
by


factors
affecting
photosynthesis
there
are
three
main
factors
affecting
photosynthesis
light
intensity
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
concentration
temperature
light
intensity
if
there
is
little
light
shining
on
a
plant
the
reactions
will
not
work
efficiently


this
means
that
will
not
happen
quickly
and
therefore
little
and
will
be
made


this
shortage
of
and
will
lead
to
the
reactions
not
working
as
and
are
needed
for
the
reactions
to
work


<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
levels
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
is
used
in
the
reactions


it
combines
with
and
and
various
other
chemicals
such
as
to
form
glucose


therefore
if
there
is
not
enough
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
then
there
will
be
a
build
up
of
and
and
not
enough
glucose
will
be
formed


temperature
there
are
many
enzymes
working
in
reactions
such
as
the
enzyme
in


these
enzymes
will
not
work
as
well
or
stop
working
at
all
at
high
or
low
temperatures
and
therefore
so
will
the

the
flea
is
an
insect
that
lives
on
many
kinds
of
animals
and
sometimes
humans


fleas
are
considered
parasites
and
they
drink
the
blood
of
the
animal
they
bite


fleas
can
live
outdoors
in
sand
or
tall
grass
and
they
will
jump
to
any
passing
animal
and
lay
eggs


flea
bites
are
usually
red
bumps
and
they
itch


they
can
carry
disease
and
make
animals
sick

types

the

after

the

grew
inside

eventually
blocking
the
path
to
its

because
of

the
flea
was
always
hungry


when
the

would
bite
a

it
opened
up

since

was

the

the
king
of
portugal
changed
it
to
cape
of
<collocation>good hope</collocation>


he
called
it
this
because
the
cape
gave
the
portuguese
a
new
chance
to
find
a

to

in
van

the
cape


he
started
the

company


this
was
so
that
they
could
give
fresh
food
to
ships
on
their
way
to
the
south
of
asia


there
were
very
few
native
people
living
in

cape


because
of
this
slaves
were
brought
from
indonesia
madagascar

india
to
work
at

colony


in

britain
took
the
cape
from

company
to
stop

from
taking
it


the

gave
it
back
in

then
annexed
the
cape
in
when
the
dutch
east

company
went
bankrupt

were

was

made

make
money

it
may
be
suggested
that
there

<collocation>ethnic diversity</collocation>


today
the

in

from
many
cultures
is
enjoyed
by
all
and
marketed
to
tourists
who
wish
to
taste
south
african
food


food
is
not
the
only
thing
music
and
dance
is
there
too


south
african
food
is
mostly
meat
based
and
has
spawned
the
south

social
gathering
known
as
a
or
barbecue


south
africa
has
also
developed
into
a
big
wine
maker


it
has
some
of
the
best
vineyards
lying
in
valleys
around
and


most
south
african
blacks
still
have
poor
lives


it
is
among
these
people
however
that
cultural
traditions
live
most
strongly


this
is
because
blacks
have
become
broken
link
urbanisation
and
parts
of
traditional
culture
have
fallen
