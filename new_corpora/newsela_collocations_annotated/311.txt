was
a

and
president
who
led

he
became
leader
after
he
overthrew
salvador
a
socialist
president


about
chilean
people
died
because
of
rule
and
many
other
people
were
tortured


many
of
the
people
that
died
during
rule
were
communists
however
many
of
supporters
died
as
well


introduced
many
free
market
policies
bringing
growth
and
great
economic
progress
to
chile


the
coup
that
was
launched
to
overthrow
and
put
in
power
was
supported
by
the
united
states
as
was
regime


in
there
was
a
plebiscite
in
chile


the
people
were
asked
whether
should
rule
for
another
eight
and
a
half
years


about
of
the
people
did
not
want
that


respected
the
wish
of
the
people
and
stepped
down
from
power
in


became
the
next
president


kept
his
responsibilities
as
head
of
the
military
until


after
this
he
became
a
senator


he
left
the
senate
in
but
he
was
not
arrested
because
the
<collocation>supreme court</collocation>
of
chile
said
he
suffered
from
dementia


in
may
judges
said
that
was
not
true


on

he
was
placed
under

a
plasma
lamp
showing
some
of
the
more
complex
things
a
plasma
can
do


the
colors
come
from
the
gas
in
the
lamp


each
type
of
gas
makes
a
different
color


tubes
often
contain
plasma


this
one
shows
neon


the
color
of
the
tube
gives
a
hint
to
the
gas
inside


plasma
is
a
form
also
called
state
of
matter


the
three
other
common
states
of
matter
are
solids
liquids
and
gases
so
plasma
is
sometimes
called
the
fourth
state
of
matter


plasma
is
created
by
adding
energy
to
a
gas
so
its
atoms
and
molecules
separate
called
ionization
into
negatively
charged
electrons
and
positively
charged
ions


unlike
the
other
states
of
matter
the
charged
particles
in
a
plasma
will
react
strongly
to
electric
and
<collocation>magnetic fields</collocation>
electromagnetic
fields


if
a
plasma
loses
heat
the
ions
will
into
a
gas


over
of
the
matter
in
the
visible
universe
is
believed
to
be
plasma


when
the
atoms
in
a
gas
are
broken
up
the
pieces
are
called
electrons
and
ions


because
these
pieces
have
an
electric
charge
they
are
pulled
together
or
pushed
apart
by
electric
fields
and
<collocation>magnetic fields</collocation>


this
makes
a
plasma
act
different
from
a
gas


for
example
<collocation>magnetic fields</collocation>
can
be
used
to
hold
a
plasma
but
not
to
hold
a
gas


plasma
is
a
better
conductor
of
electricity
than
copper


plasma
is
usually
very
hot
because
it
takes
very
high
temperatures
to
break
the
bonds
between
electrons
and
the
nuclei
of
the
atoms


sometimes
can
have
very
high
pressure
like
in
stars


stars
including
the
sun
are
mostly
made
of
plasma


can
also
have
very
low
pressure
like
in
outer
space


on
earth
lightning
and
aurora
make
plasma


artificial
uses
of
plasma
include
fluorescent
neon
signs
and
<collocation>plasma displays</collocation>
used
for
television
or
computer
screens


scientists
are
experimenting
with
plasma
to
make
a
new
kind
of
nuclear
power
called
fusion
which
would
be
much
better
and
safer
than
ordinary
nuclear
power
and
would
produce
much
less
radioactive
waste
