and
they
might
not
because
many
of
our
<collocation>favorite sayings</collocation>
come
from
the
authorized
king
james
version
of
the
bible
and
from
shakespeare


some
people
use
grammar
that
is
different
from
other
people
when
speaking


for
example
people
who
use
what
is
called
general
american
english
or
english
might
say
i
did
do
anything
while
someone
who
speaks
what
is
called
african
american
vernacular
english
or
might
say
i
did
do
nothing


london
working
class
version
i
ai
done


these
are
called
double
negatives
and
are
found
almost
entirely
in
spoken
language
not
written
language


these
differences
are
called
dialects


the
dialect
a
person
uses
is
usually
decided
by
where
they
live


even
though
the
dialects
of
english
use
different
words
or
word
order
they
still
have
grammar
rules


however
when
writing
in
american
english
grammar
uses
the
rules
of
general
american
english


when
people
talk
about
using
proper
english
they
usually
mean
using
the
grammar
of
general
british
english
as
described
in
standard
reference
works


the
models
for
spoken
english
in
britain
are
often
called
received
pronunciation
or
english


syntax
grammar
studies
syntax
as
well
as
the
different
parts
of
language


these
are
called
parts
of
speech


they
fit
together
according
to
rules
and
create
sentences


<collocation>sentences fit</collocation>
together
and
create
paragraphs

nouns

<collocation>nouns nouns</collocation>
are
thing
words
like
table
and
chair


they
are
objects
things
you
see
in
everyday
life


<collocation>proper nouns</collocation>
are
places
people
names
or
other
things
like
days
of

the
name
james
is
a
proper

as

wednesday
and
london


nouns

also

as
suffering
or
happiness


<collocation>verbs verbs</collocation>

action
john

the
basic
verb
form
is
called
the
infinitive


the
infinitive
for
existence
is
to
be


a
famous
example
is
the
speech
of
hamlet
to
be
or
not
to
be
that
is
the
question


variations
of
the

ecological
threats
the
great
lakes
are
home
to
a
variety
of
species
of
fish
and
other
organisms


in
recent
years
overfishing
caused
a
decline
in
<collocation>lake trout</collocation>


the
drop
in
<collocation>lake trout</collocation>
increased
the
population


in
response
the
government
introduced
salmon
as
a
predator
to
decrease
the
population


this
program
was
so
successful
that
the
salmon
population
rose
rapidly
and
the
states
surrounding
lake
michigan
promoted
salmon
snagging


this
has
been
made
illegal
in
all
of
the

states
except
for
a
limited
season
in
illinois


lake
michigan
is
now
being
stocked
with
several
species
of
fish


however
several
invader
species
such
as
round
goby
and
zebra
mussels
threaten
the
native
fish
populations


<collocation>invasive species</collocation>
accidentally
introduced
species
are
a
big
problem


since
the
century
about
species
have
invaded
the
great

ecosystem
causing
severe
economic
and
ecological
impacts


according
to
the
inland
<collocation>seas education</collocation>
association
they
deprive

of
food
<collocation>cause blooms</collocation>
of
toxic
algae
and
foul

spawning
areas
and

water
intakes


on
average
a
new
<collocation>invasive species</collocation>
enters
the
great

every
eight
months


two
important
infestations
in
the
great
lakes
are
the
zebra
mussel
first
discovered
in

the
mussel
in


fact
date
january
these
molluscs
are
<collocation>efficient filter</collocation>
feeders


they
compete
with
native
mussels
and
also
reduce
available
food
and
spawning
grounds
for
fish


also
the
<collocation>mussels hurt</collocation>
utility
and
manufacturing
industries
by
clogging
or
blocking
pipes


the
fish
and
wildlife
service
estimates
that
the
economic
impact
of
the
zebra
mussel
will
be
about
billion
over
the
next
decade


because
the
mussel
is
good
at
filtering
plankton
from
the
lake
water
sunlight
reaches
deeper
into
the
lake


this
increases
the
growth
of
algae


pollution
chemicals
from
industrial
plants
run
off
the
land
into
rivers
and
arrive
in
the
lakes


some
of
these
chemicals
are
highly
toxic
such
as
mercury


contaminated
water
from
sewer
overflows
also
reaches
the
lakes
and
beaches
get
closed
because
of
the
threat
of
pathogenic
bacteria

a
piece

and
anyone
else
who

the

considered
because
the

it

be
easy
to

some

some

but
it
would
not

glass
is
a
hard
material
that
can
be
made
in
many
shapes


it
is
usually
transparent
but
it
can
also
be
made
in
colors


glass
is
made
of
sand
that
is
heated
until
it
is
liquid


when
it
is
liquid
it
is
shaped
and
left
to
cool


glass
is
often
used
to
make
windows
and
bottles


many
churches
have
windows
made
of
<collocation>colored glass</collocation>


glass
is
used
to
make
lenses


the
word
glasses
is
often
used
to
mean
eyeglasses


the
myth
that
glass
is
actually
a
liquid
comes
from
the
fact
that
old
windows
in
houses
and
churches
years
old
are
sometimes
a
little
out
of
shape
thicker
at
the
bottom
than
the
top


this
is
actually
due
to
the
process
of
glass
making
in
the
past
which
led
to
the
glass
pane
being
thicker
at
one
edge
than
the
other


it
was
sensible
to
install
the
windows
with
the
thick
edge
at
the
bottom


sometimes
a
window
can
be
found
with
the
thick
edge
at
the
top
of
the
window


glass
can
be
recycled
over
and
over


glass
bottles
and
jars
can
easily
be
recycled
to
make
new
glass
bottles
and
jars
or
used

as

such

in
the
year
approximately
of
the
world
population
were
part
of
one
of
the
three
main
religions
christian
islam
less
than
judaism
with
buddhism
with
hinduism
with
traditional
chinese
religion
with
various
other
religions
and
less
than
as


most
of
these
<collocation>religious beliefs</collocation>
involve
god
or
gods


god
in
the
religions
religions
are
very
popular
ones


religions
include
judaism
christianity
and
islam


means
the
people
in
these
religions
believe
there
is
only
one
god


the
name
of
god
is
usually
not
allowed
to
be
said
in
judaism
but
some
jews
today
call
him
yahweh
or
jehovah


muslims
say
the
word
allah
which
is
the
arabic
word
for
the
god


believers
in
the
religions
except
islamic
believers
believe
that
god
has
created
human
beings
in
his
image
but
this
idea
is
rarely
taken
literally


the
idea
of
an
old
man
with
a
beard
has
been
used
in
art
since
the
renaissance
but
is
not
what
most
actually
believe
he
looks
like


god
in
christianity
main
god
in
christianity
the
christian
bible
talks
about
god
in
different
ways


christians
say
that
the
<collocation>old testament</collocation>
talks
about
god
the
father


the
new
testament
is
about
jesus
or
god
the
son


many
christians
also
believe
that
jesus
was
god
incarnation
on
earth


christians
consider
the
holy
spirit
to
be
god
as
well


in
the
new
testament
there
are
three
beings
who
are
said
to
be
god
in
different
forms
the
father
the
son
and
the
holy
spirit
also
known
as
the
holy
ghost


this
is
called
the
holy
trinity
by
most
people
who
believe
in
it


although
the
word
trinity
is
not
in
the
bible
the
word
used
for
god
in
chapter
one
of
genesis
is
plural
and
the
words
in
the
name
of
the
father
son
and
holy
spirit
are
used
in
the
new
testament
matthew
another
word
that
most
christians
believe
means
the
same
thing
as
trinity
is
godhead


some
believe
that
jesus
was
just
a
man
that
talked
about
god


members
of
the
unitarian
church
have
these
beliefs


christians
believe
that
god
turned
into
a
man
named
jesus
and
came
to
earth
to
save
everyone
from
sin


when
jesus
prayed
and
talked
to
god
he
called
him
father
and
taught
others
to
do
the
same


god
in
eastern
religions
in
hinduism
there
is
only
one
god
named
brahman
but
brahman
is
said
to
have
taken
on
many
different
incarnations


some
of
these
are
krishna
buddha
shiva
kali
and


to
many
outsiders
the
worship
of
god
different
incarnations
is
considered
to
be
the
worship
of
many
gods


however
it
is
really
only
the
worship
of
one
god
in
different
ways


some
hindus
also
believe
that
the
spirit
of
god
lives
in
everyone


this
idea
is
called
which
is
the
hindu
term
for


religions
like
buddhism
and
confucianism
involve
the
worship
of
many
gods
or
sometimes
no
gods
at
all


god
in
western
philosophy
philosophers
can
talk
about
god
or
god
sometimes
they
talk
about
a
specific
god
but
other
times
they
are
just
talking
about
the
idea
of
god


one
of
the
earliest
western
philosophers
to
write
about
god
in
a
way
was
the
greek
aristotle
who
describes
god
as
the
supreme
cause


aristotle
saw
god
as
a
being
that
makes
everything
happen
but
is
not
influenced
by
anything
else


there
are
also
some
philosophical
problems
with
god


one
of
them
is
called
god
paradox


it
is
a
question
about
whether
an
omnipotent
god
can
make
a
mountain
that
is
so
heavy
he
can
not
lift
it
