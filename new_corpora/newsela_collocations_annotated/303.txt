this
graph
shows
the
<collocation>unemployment rate</collocation>
by
year
in
the
united
states


a
graph
is
a
picture
designed
to
express
words
particularly
the
connection
between
two
or
more
quantities


you
can
see
a
graph
on
the
right


a
simple
graph
usually
shows
the
relationship
between
two
numbers
or
measurements
in
the
form
of
a
grid


if
this
is
a
rectangular
graph
these
two
measurements
will
be
arranged
into
two
different
lines
at
right
angles
to
one
another


one
of
these
lines
will
be
going
up
the
<collocation>vertical axis</collocation>


the
other
one
will
be
going
right
the
<collocation>horizontal axis</collocation>


these
lines
or
axes
the
plural
of
axis
meet
at
their
ends
in
the
lower
left
corner
of
the
graph


both
of
these
axes
have
tick
marks
along
their
lengths


you
can
think
of
each
axis
as
a
ruler
drawn
on
paper


so
each
measurement
is
indicated
by
the
length
of
the
associated
tick
mark
along
the
particular
axis


another
word
for
graph
is
chart
or
diagram


however
a
chart
or
a
diagram
may
not
relate
one
quantity
to
other
quantities


and
tree
diagrams
are

charts

how
to
draw
a
simple
graph
let
say
you
wanted
to
make
a
graph
showing
your
height
as
you
were
growing
up


you
might
show
your
height
in
centimeters
on
the
<collocation>vertical axis</collocation>
and
your
age
in
years
on
the
<collocation>horizontal axis</collocation>


for
example
say
you
were
centimeters
tall
at
age
centimeters
tall
at
age
and
centimeters
tall
at
age


you
would
draw
an
imaginary
straight
line
passing
through
the
centimeters
height
mark
on
the
<collocation>vertical axis</collocation>


then
you
would
draw
a
second
imaginary
line
passing
through
the
age
of
year
on
the
<collocation>horizontal axis</collocation>


at
the
place
where
the
two
imaginary
lines
meet
called
their
intersection
you
would
then
draw
a
dot


really
the
imaginary
lines
are
usually
replaced
by
graph
paper
see
below


the
drawing
of
this
intersection
is
called
plotting
the
point
centimeters
for
year


you
would
then
plot
centimeters
for
year
and
centimeters
for
year


if
you
had
more
heights
for
more
years
you
would
plot
years
and
so
forth


when
you
had
enough
points
on
your
graph
you
could
draw
a
line
through
each
of
the
plotted
points
making
your
graph
a
line
graph


for
example
the
line
graph
at
the
upper
right
shows
the
<collocation>unemployment rate</collocation>
as
a
percent
on
the
<collocation>vertical axis</collocation>
and
the
year
from
to
on
the
<collocation>horizontal axis</collocation>


let
say
you
wanted
a
single
graph
showing
both
your
height
and
your
brother
height


this
could
be
expressed
as
two
sets
of
plotted
points
one
for
you
and
one
for
your
brother


you
could
use
different
colors
to
tell
your
plot
from
your
brother


or
you
might
plot
the
<collocation>gross domestic</collocation>
product
in
billions
of
dollars
as
a
second
line
against
the
same
years
on
the
unemployment
graph
above


this
would
show
you
the
relationship
between
and
unemployment


uses
of
graphs
see
also
table
information
graphs
make
information
easier
to
see


this
is
especially
true
when
two
or
more
sets
of
numbers
are
related
in
some
way


for
example
the
<collocation>unemployment rates</collocation>
graph
at
the
beginning
of
this
article
could
be
expressed
in
the
form
of
a
table


like
this
year
<collocation>unemployment rate</collocation>


but
a
long
string
of
numbers
makes
it
difficult
to
see
the
underlying
meaning


it
is
much
simpler
to
understand
when
the
table
is
expressed
in
the
form
of
a
graph


in
particular
it
is
easier
to
see
the
relationships
between
the
two
sets
of
data


for
example
by
looking
at
the
graph
you
can
see
at
a
glance
that
unemployment
was
relatively
low
in
the
late
sixties
but
relatively
high
in
the
early
eighties


scientists
and
engineers
use
graphs
so
that
they
can
get
a
better
understanding
of
the
broad
meaning
and
importance
of
their
data


salesmen
and
businessmen
often
use
graphs
to
add
importance
to
their
points
in
a
sales
or
business
presentation


graphs
with
many
plotted
points
may
be
created
on
a
computer
rather
than
being
drawn
by
hand


mathematicians
use
graphs
that
plot
themselves
without
taking
measurements


for
example
the
formula
x
y
says
that
the
value
of
x
will
always
be
equal
to
the
value
of
if
you
plot
this
formula
as
a
graph
with
x
as
the
<collocation>horizontal axis</collocation>
and
y
as
the
<collocation>vertical axis</collocation>
you
will
get
a
graph
that
looks
like
a
straight
line
angled
at
precisely
degrees


the
use
of
these
graphs
forms
a
branch
of
mathematics
called
analytic
geometry

paper
graph

usually
graphs
are
created
on

designed
paper
called

this
paper

on
it


on
the

an
example

about
in
the

above
is
the
commonest
form
of

it
sometimes
