semantics
general
semantics
is
a
philosophy
that
deals
with
how
people
react
to
things
that
happen
around
them
based
on
meaning


it
was
created
by
alfred
during
the
and
early


the
goal
of
general
semantics
is
for
people
to
know
that
when
we
simplify
something
either
mentally
or
in
language
that
simplification
is
not
the
same
thing
as
the
thing
simplified


how
people
understand
reality
is
not
the
same
as
what
reality
is
because
people
do
not
know
everything
about
reality


general
semantics
teaches
that
there
is
always
more
to
something
than
what
is
seen
heard
felt
or
believed

or
is
a
<collocation>theoretical framework</collocation>
for
the
study
of
the
meaning
of

it
was
first
developed
in
the
early
century
separately
by
the
swiss
and
charles
sanders
of
the


it
can
be
described
as
both
a
science
and
a
technique
a
science
because
it
has
its
own
theories
and
a
technique
because
it
is
a
way
of
studying
systems
of
representation
and
meaning


semiotics
is
usually
divided
into
three
parts
semantics
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
words
or

used
who
said
it
to
whom
and
in

nitrogen
is
a
colorless
odorless
gas
at
normal
temperature


it
is
normally
bonded
to
another
nitrogen
atom
making
a
nitrogen
molecule
n


the
bond
is
very
strong


that
is
why
many
explosives
contain
nitrogen


the
bond
is
broken
when
the
explosive
is
made


when
it
explodes
the
bond
forms
releasing
a
lot
of
energy


it
turns
into
a
liquid
at
c
and
turns
into
a
solid
at
if
it
is
compressed
it
can
be
turned
into
a
liquid
without
making
it
cold


it
is
very
because
of
its
strong
bond


the
bond
prevents
it
from
reacting


lithium
is
one
of
the
only
chemical
elements
that
react
with
nitrogen
without
being
heated


magnesium
can
burn
in
nitrogen


nitrogen
also
makes
blue
electric
sparks


the
blue
color
is
caused
by
the
atoms
being
excited


when
they
get
normal
again
they
release
light


when
nitrogen
is
excited
it
reacts
with
many
things
that
it
does
not
normally
react
with


a
nice

nitrates
and


nitrogen
comes
in
several
oxidation
states
and


each
of
those
oxidation
states
has
its
set
of
compounds


compounds
in
the
oxidation
state
are

history
nitrogen
was
discovered
by
daniel
rutherford
in
who
called
it
noxious
gas
or
fixed
gas


they
discovered
that
part
of
air
did
not
burn


it
was
found
that
animals
died
in
it


it
was
known
as


many
nitrogen
compounds
also
contain
the
or
letters
such
as
hydrazine


in
lord
found
out
that
when
a
spark
was
passed
through
nitrogen
it
made
a
reactive
form
of
nitrogen


this
nitrogen
reacted
with
many
metals
and
compounds


<collocation>safety nitrogen</collocation>
is
not
poisonous


we
can
safely
breathe
it
when
it
is
a
part
of
air
but
we
can
not
breathe
pure
nitrogen
by
itself
because
it
does
not
have
the
oxygen
that
we
need
to
live


anyone
that
inhales
pure
nitrogen
will
just
fall
asleep
and
die

spam
emails
are
often
sent
to
many
people
at
once
trying
to
get
them
to
buy
a
product
or
sign
up
for
a
service


the
people
who
receive
the
email
did
not
ask
to
receive
the
email
and
do
not
want
to
receive
it


one
of
the
reasons
there
is
so
much
spam
emails
around
is
that
it
costs
very
little
to
send
millions
of
<collocation>spam messages</collocation>
at
once


<collocation>spam messages</collocation>
can
easily
be
sent
sometimes
even
by
a
special
computer
program


how
find
email
addresses
the
hardest
part
about
is
to
get
the
email
addresses
to
send
the
spam
to


sometimes
the
do
this
by
searching
for
emails
on
the
internet
or
by
buying
emails
from
people
who
know
a
lot
of
them
for
example
someone
who
runs
a
site
that
makes
users
tell
them
their
email
address
to
will
have
a
lot
of
email
addresses
to
sell
to


method
one
one
part
of
getting
addresses
is
to
find
addresses
that
are
still
in
use


one
trick
used
by
is
to
put
a
link
at
the
end
of
a
message
like
this
if
you
do
not
wish
to
get
more
of
these
messages
from
us
click
here
to
stop
getting
them


if
the
person
clicks
on
the
link
it
tells
the
that
there
is
someone
at
the
address


then
the
put
that
person
on
a
list
of
people
who
actually
open
<collocation>spam messages</collocation>


next
the
sell
that
list
to
other


the
same
thing
happens
if
the
person
sends
another
email
back
to
the
called
replying
which
also
tells
the
the
message
has
been
opened


method
two
another
trick
that
use
is
to
put
a
picture
even
one
that
can
not
be
seen
into
a
spam
message


the
picture
will
have
a
name
that
goes
with
just
that
one
email


when
the
email
is
opened
a
request
will
be
sent
to
the
server
that
has
that
picture
to
get
the
image


if
they
get
this
request
then
they
know
that
you
read
their
email
which
could
cause
a
person
to
receive
even
more
<collocation>email spam</collocation>


other
meanings

so
that

people

the

not

usually

an
earthquake
also
known
as
a
quake
or
tremor
is
a
violent
movement
of
the
rocks
in
the
earth
crust


earthquakes
are
usually
quite
brief
but
may
repeat
over
a
long
period
of
time


they
are
the
result
of
a
sudden
release
of
energy
in
the
earth
crust


this
creates
seismic
waves
waves
of
energy
that
travel
through
the
earth


there
are
large
earthquakes
and
small
earthquakes


big
earthquakes
can
take
down
buildings
and
cause
death
and
injury


the
study
of
earthquakes
is
called
seismology


<collocation>seismology studies</collocation>
the
frequency
type
and
size
of
earthquakes
over
a
period
of
time


when
the
earth
moves
offshore
in
the
ocean
it
can
cause
a
tsunami


this
can
cause
just
as
much
death
and
destruction
as
an
earthquake


landslides
can
happen
too


this
is
an
important
part
of
the
earth
rock
cycle


earthquakes
are
measured
using
observations
from
seismometers


the
magnitude
of
an
earthquake
and
the
intensity
of
shaking
is
usually
reported
on
the
<collocation>richter scale</collocation>


on

history
the
ancient
chinese
used
a
device
that
looked
like
a
jar
with
dragons
on
the
top
surrounded
by
frogs
with
their
mouths
open


when
an
earthquake
occurred
a
ball
fitted
into
each
dragon
mouth
would
drop
out
of
the
dragon
mouth
into
the
frog


the
position
of
the
frog
which
received
a
ball
indicated
the
direction
of
the
earthquake


causes
of
earthquakes
main
plate
tectonics
fault
types
earthquakes
are
caused
by
tectonic
movements
in
the
earth
crust


the
main
cause
is
that
when
<collocation>tectonic plates</collocation>
collide
one
rides
over
the
other
causing
mountain
building
earthquakes
and
volcanoes


the
boundaries
between
moving
plates
form
the
largest
fault
surfaces
on
earth


when
they
stick
relative
motion
between
the
plates
leads
to
increasing
stress


this
continues
until
the
stress
rises
and
breaks
suddenly
allowing
sliding
over
the
locked
portion
of
the
fault
releasing
the
stored
energy


earthquake
fault
types
there
are
three
main
types
of
fault
that
may
cause
an
earthquake
normal
reverse
thrust
and


<collocation>normal faults</collocation>
occur
mainly
in
areas
where
the
crust
is
being
extended


reverse
faults
occur
in
areas
where
the
crust
is
being
shortened


faults
are
steep
structures
where
the
two
sides
of
the
<collocation>fault slip</collocation>
horizontally
past
each
other


earthquake
clusters
most
earthquakes
form
part
of
a
sequence
related
to
each
other
in
terms
of
location
and
time


most
earthquake
clusters
consist
of
small
tremors
which
cause
little
to
no
damage
but
there
is
a
theory
that
earthquakes
can
recur
in
a
regular
pattern


a
foreshock
is
an
earthquake
that
occurs
before
a
larger
earthquake
the


a
foreshock
is
in
the
same
area
of
the
main
shock
but
always
of
a
smaller
magnitude


an
aftershock
is
an
earthquake
that
occurs
after
a
previous
earthquake
the


an
aftershock
is
in
the
same
region
of
the
main
shock
but
always
of
a
smaller
magnitude


aftershocks
are
formed
as
the
crust
adjusts
to
the
effects
of
the
main
shock


earthquake
swarms
are
sequences
of
earthquakes
striking
in
a
specific
area
within
a
short
period
of
time


they
are
different
from
earthquakes
followed
by
a
series
of
aftershocks
by
the
fact
that
no
single
earthquake
in
the
sequence
is
obviously
the
main
shock
therefore
none
have
notable
higher
than
the
other


an
example
of
an
<collocation>earthquake swarm</collocation>
is
the
activity
at
yellowstone
national
park


sometimes
a
series
of
earthquakes
occur
in
a
sort
of
earthquake
storm
where
the
earthquakes
strike
a
fault
in
clusters
each
triggered
by
the
shaking
or
stress
redistribution
of
the
previous
earthquakes


similar
to
aftershocks
but
on
<collocation>adjacent segments</collocation>
of
fault
these
storms
occur
over
the
course
of
years
and
with
some
of
the
later
earthquakes
as
damaging
as
the
early
ones


such
a
pattern
occurred
in
the
north
anatolian
fault
in
turkey
in
the
century

tsunami
or
a
chain
of
fast
moving
waves
in
the
ocean
caused
by
powerful
earthquakes
is
a
very
serious
challenge
for
people
safety
and
for
earthquake
engineering


those
waves
can
coastal
areas
destroy
houses
and
even
swipe
away
whole
towns


unfortunately
tsunamis
can
not
be
prevented


however
there
are
warning
systems
which
may
warn
the
population
before
the
big
waves
reach
the
land
to
let
them
enough
time
to
rush
to
safety
