a
computer
programmer
is
a
person
who
makes
computer
programs
using
a
programming
language


programmers
are
also
called
software
developers
coders
or
hackers


a
programmer
main
jobs
are
writing
program
source
code
testing
if
it
works
and
debugging
fixing
the
program
if
there
are
problems


programmers
often
use
software
tools
such
as
text
editors
and
ides
<collocation>integrated development</collocation>
environments
to
help
them
work


programming
is
a
unique
profession
because
a
programmer
can
work
from
a
computer
anywhere
in
the
world


this
is
called
doing
work
on
the
internet
instead
of
in
an
office


some
programmers
are
famous
because
their
software
is
used
by
many
people


one
example
is
who
created
an
important
part
of
the
operating
system


programming
can
be
done
in
many
different
languages
and
can
look
very
different
but
do
the
same
thing


an
example
of
this
is
the
hello
world
program


a
programming
language
is
a
type
of
written
language
that
tells
computers
what
to
do


programming
languages
are
used
to
make
all
computer
programs
and
computer
software


a
programming
language
is
like
a
set
of
instructions
that
the
computer
follows
to
do
something


a
programmer
writes
source
code
text
in
the
programming
language
to
create
programs


usually
the
programming
language
uses
real
words
for
some
of
the
commands
so
that
the
language
is
easier
for
a
human
to
read


many
programming
languages
use
punctuation
just
like
a
normal
language


many
programs
now
are
compiled


this
means
that
the
computer
translates
the
source
code
into
new
languages
such
as
assembly
language
or
machine
language
which
are
much
faster
and
easier
for
the
computer
to
read
but
much
harder
for
a
person
to
read


computer
programs
must
be
written
very
carefully


if
the
programmer
makes
mistakes
or
the
program
tries
to
do
something
the
programmer
did
not
design
it
to
do
the
program
might
then
crash
or
stop
working


when
a
program
has
a
problem
because
of
how
the
code
was
written
this
is
called
a
bug


a
very
small
mistake
can
cause
a
very
big
problem


for
example
forgetting
a
period
or
typing
a
plus
sign
instead
of
a
minus
sign
can
cause
a
bad
bug

types
of
programming
languages
there
are
many
types
of
programming
languages


most
programming
languages
do
not
follow
one
type
alone
so
it
is
difficult
to
assign
a
type
for
each
language


the
examples
of
each
type
are
given
in
each
section
below
because
they
are
the
best
examples
of
that
type


<collocation>imperative programming</collocation>
programming
languages
describe
a
problem
but
they
usually
do
not
say
how
the
problem
should
be
solved


the
problem
description
uses
logic
solving
the
problem
often
looks
like
automatically
proving
a
system
of
logical
axioms


examples
for
such
programming
languages
are
lisp
and
<collocation>imperative programming</collocation>
languages
describe
a
system
of
state
changes


at
the
start
the
program
is
in
a
certain
state
and
the
computer
is
given
steps
to
follow
in
order
to
perform
an
action


following
the
steps
causes
the
program
to
change
state


in
general
programming
languages
are
safer
and
shorter


<collocation>imperative programming</collocation>
languages
are
more
common
because
they
are
easier
to
use


functional
procedural
functional
programming
looks
at
programming
like
a
function
in
mathematics


the
program
receives
input
some
information
and
uses
this
information
to
create
output


it
will
not
have
a
state
in
between
and
it
will
also
not
change
things
that
are
not
related
to
the
computation


<collocation>procedural programs</collocation>
are
a
set
of
steps
or
state
changes


stack
based
stack
based
languages
look
at
the
some
of
the
program
memory
like
a
stack
of
cards


there
are
very
few
things
that
can
be
done
with
a
stack


a
data
item
can
be
put
on
the
top
of
the
stack


this
operation
is
generally
called
push


a
data
item
can
be
removed
from
the
top
of
the
stack


this
is
called
a
pop


you
can
look
at
the
item
at
the
top
of
the
stack
without
removing
it


this
is
called
a
peek


if
a
program
is
written
as
push
push
add
pop
it
will
put
on
the
top
of
the
stack
put
on
top
of
the
add
the
top
two
values
replace
the
and
with
the
and
print
the
top


examples
for
programming
languages
that
are
are
the
languages
postscript
and
forth


programming
languages
place
data
and
functions
that
change
data
into
a
single
unit


this
unit
is
called
an
object


objects
can
interact
with
each
other
but
one
object
can
not
change
another
object
data


this
is
usually
called
or
information
hiding


most
modern
programming
languages
are


an
example
of
this
is
java
or
c


flow
oriented
programming
sees
programming
as
connecting
different
components


these
components
send
messages
back
and
forth


a
single
component
can
be
part
of
different
programs
without
the
need
to
be
changed
internally


rules
every
programming
language
has
rules
about
what
it
can
and
can
not
do


these
include
correct
numbers
types
of
numbers
and
how
large
or
small
the
numbers
can
go
words
reserved
words
limits
on
what
the
programming
language
can
do
most
languages
have
official
standards
that
define
the
rules
of
how
to
write
the
source
code


some
programming
languages
have
two
or
more
standards


this
can
happen
when
a
new
standard
replaces
an
old
one


for
example
the
standard
replaced
in


it
can
happen
because
two
people
made
two
standards
at
the
same
time


for
example
there
are
several
standards
for
apl


programming
programming
sometimes
shortened
to
is
a
form
of
programming
where
all
parts
of
the
program
are
objects


objects
are
pieces
of
memory
with
the
same
structure
that
can
be
used
again
and
again


a
bank
account
or
hero
from
a
video
game
could
all
be
objects
within
a
program


objects
are
made
up
of
properties
pieces
of
information
the
object
stores
and
methods
which
are
things
the
object
can
do


a
dog
object
might
have
properties
like
height
and


its
methods
might
include
bark
and


all
objects
are
created
from
templates
called
classes


you
can
think
of
a
class
as
a
mold
from
which
objects
are
made


the
class
defines
all
the
properties
and
methods
that
its
objects
will
have


objects
created
from
a
class
are
called
instances
of
the
class


a
class
can
extend
another
class
which
means
that
it
takes
all
the
properties
and
methods
of
the
class
but
can
add
its
own


here
is
an
example
of
what
a
class
might
look
like
in
a
programming
language
class
dog
extends
mammal
these
are
properties
string
breed
collie
string
type
herding
dog
these
are
methods
void
do
some
wagging
<collocation>void bark</collocation>
do
the
barking
here
notice
that
the
dog
class
extends
the
<collocation>mammal class</collocation>
so
all
dogs
will
have
the
properties
of
a
mammal
like
and
methods
like
eat
or
sleep

<collocation>visual basic</collocation>
is
a
programming
language
developed
by
for
their
operating
system
windows


the
basic
language
is
said
to
be
easier
to
read
than
other
languages


<collocation>visual basic</collocation>
is
a
widely
understood
programming
language
written
using
simple
words
and
syntax


it
is
an
interpreted
language
code
can
be
run
immediately
after
being
written


having
an
interpreter
makes
it
simpler
to
use
as
there
is
no
need
for
the
computer
to
compile
the
code
possibly
finding
errors
to
fix
before
the
compiled
version
can
be
run


once
the
code
is
working
it
can
be
compiled
into
an


file
so
that
it
will
run
on
all
modern
windows
computers
whether
is
installed
or
not


the
language
allows
a
beginning
programmer
to
produce
windows
applications
as
it
includes
drawing
tools
to
create
normal
windows
forms


also
includes
advanced
features
concepts
and
structures
which
allow
programs
to
be
adapted
for
use
with
the
internet


<collocation>visual basic</collocation>
will
not
run
on
<collocation>operating systems</collocation>
other
than

and
on

though
the
program
has
received
criticism
for
its
perceived
faults
<collocation>visual basic</collocation>
was
a
<collocation>runaway commercial</collocation>

<collocation>visual basic</collocation>


the

<collocation>visual basic</collocation>
and
this
was
combined
with
the

provided
the

booting
is
what
happens
when
a
computer
starts
up


when
you
boot
a
computer
your
processor
looks
in
system
rom
the
bios
for
instructions
and
does
them


they
normally
wake
up
cards
and
searches
for
the
<collocation>boot device</collocation>


the
<collocation>boot device</collocation>
either
loads
the
operating
system
or
gets
the
operating
system
from
someplace
else


people
use
the
word
boot
to
mean
to
start
a
computer
or
other
device
with
electronics
built
in


for
example
if
a
person
wants
to
ask
a
friend
to
turn
on
a
satellite
phone
they
would
say
could
you
boot
up
the
satellite
phone


most
<collocation>operating systems</collocation>
call
the
first
device
it
uses
a
<collocation>boot device</collocation>


this
is
because
the
computer
is
making
itself
go
as
in
the
idiom


when
we
start
a
computer
we
can
often
see
the
simple
instructions
the
computer
uses
to
start
then
more
complicated
pictures
or
software


the
phrase
to
boot
in
this
meaning
is
short
for
to
bootstrap


this
use
is
part
of
net
jargon
along
with
similar
words
like
net
or
web


often
the
computer
is
just
called
a
box
so
a
phrase
like
to
boot
the
box
means
to
start
the
computer


the
term
reboot
can
also
be
used
in
a
different
context
to
mean
a
restarting
of
a
storyline
established
in
previous
iterations
of
a
series
of
fiction


to
reboot
is
not
only
a
computer
reference
but
is
also
sometime
referenced
in
giving
birth
to
cows
