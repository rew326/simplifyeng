when
this
happens
the
nucleus
has
to
get
rid
of
the
excess
mass
or
particles


it
does
this
through
radiation


an
atom
that
does
this
can
be
called
radioactive


<collocation>unstable atoms</collocation>
continue
to
be
radioactive
until
they
lose
enough
that
they
become
stable


all
atoms
above
atomic
number
protons
are
radioactive


there
are
three
main
types
of
<collocation>radioactive decay</collocation>
alpha
beta
and
gamma


<collocation>alpha decay</collocation>
is
when
the
atom
shoots
out
a
particle
having
two
protons
and
two
neutrons


this
is
essentially
a
helium
nucleus


the
result
is
an
element
with
atomic
number
two
less
than
before


so
for
example
if
a
<collocation>beryllium atom</collocation>
atomic
number
went
through
<collocation>alpha decay</collocation>
it
would
become
helium
atomic
number


<collocation>alpha decay</collocation>
happens
when
an
atom
is
too
big
and
needs
to
get
rid
of
some
mass


<collocation>beta decay</collocation>
is
when
a
neutron
turns
into
a
proton
or
a
proton
turns
into
a
neutron


in
the
first
case
the
atom
shoots
out
an
electron
in
the
second
case
it
is
a
positron
like
an
electron
but
with
a
positive
charge


the
end
result
is
an
element
with
one
higher
or
one
lower
atomic
number
than
before


<collocation>beta decay</collocation>
happens
when
an
atom
has
either
too
many
protons
or
too
many
neutrons


<collocation>gamma decay</collocation>
is
when
an
atom
shoots
out
a
<collocation>gamma ray</collocation>
or
wave


it
happens
when
there
is
a
change
in
the
energy
of
the
nucleus


this
is
usually
after
a
nucleus
has
already
gone
through
alpha
or
<collocation>beta decay</collocation>


there
is
no
change
in
the
mass
or
atomic
number
or
the
atom
only
in
the
stored
energy
inside
the
nucleus


every
radioactive
element
or
isotope
has
something
called
a
half
life


this
is
how
long
it
takes
half
of
any
sample
of
atoms
of
that
type
to
decay
until
they
become
a
different
stable
isotope
or
element


large
atoms
or
isotopes
with
a
big
difference
between
the
number
of
protons
and
neutrons
will
therefore
have
a
long
half
life

astronomy
is
the
study
of
the
universe
and
everything
in
it


this
includes
stars
planets
and
galaxies
as
well
as
other
things


the
word
astronomy
comes
from
the
greek
words
which
means
star
and
which
means
law


a
person
who
studies
astronomy
is
called
an
astronomer


astronomy
is
one
of
the
oldest
sciences


ancient
people
used
the
positions
of
the
stars
to
navigate
and
to
find
when
was
the
best
time
to
plant
crops


astronomy
is
very
similar
to
astrophysics


since
the
century
there
have
been
two
main
types
of
astronomy
observational
and
<collocation>theoretical astronomy</collocation>


<collocation>observational astronomy</collocation>
uses
telescopes
and
cameras
to
observe
or
look
at
stars
galaxies
and
other
astronomical
objects


<collocation>theoretical astronomy</collocation>
uses
maths
and
<collocation>computer models</collocation>
to
predict
what
should
happen


the
two
often
work
together
the
theoretical
predicts
what
should
happen
and
the
observational
shows
whether
the
prediction
works


astronomy
is
not
the
same
as
astrology
the
belief
that
the
patterns
the
stars
and
the
planets
may
affect
human
lives

history
of
astronomy
main
history
of
astronomy
ancient
early
astronomers
used
only
their
eyes
to
look
at
the
stars


they
used
maps
of
the
constellations
and
stars
for
religious
reasons
and
also
to
work
out
the
time
of
year


early
civilisations
such
as
the
maya
people
and
the
ancient
egyptians
built
simple
observatories
and
drew
maps
of
the
stars
positions


they
also
began
to
think
about
the
place
of
earth
in
the
universe


for
a
long
time
people
thought
earth
was
the
center
of
the
universe
and
that
the
planets
the
stars
and
the
sun
went
around
it


this
is
known
as
the
model
of
the
universe


ancient
greeks
tried
to
explain
the
motions
of
the
sun
and
stars
by
taking
measurements


a
mathematician
named
was
the
first
who
measured
the
size
of
the
earth
and
proved
that
the
earth
is
a
sphere


a
theory
by
another
mathematician
named
was
that
the
sun
is
in
the
center
and
the
earth
is
moving
around
it


this
is
known
as
the
model


only
a
small
group
of
people
thought
it
was
right


the
rest
continued
to
believe
in
the
model


most
of
the
names
of
constellations
and
stars
that
we
have
come
from
greeks
of
that
time


arabic
astronomers
made
many
advancements
during
the
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>
including
improved
star
maps
and
ways
to
estimate
the
size
of
the
earth


renaissance
to
modern
<collocation>era drawings</collocation>
of
the
moon
by
galileo


his
drawings
were
more
detailed
than
anyone
before
him
because
he
used
a
telescope
to
look
at
the
moon


during
the
renaissance
a
priest
named
copernicus
thought
from
looking
at
the
way
the
planets
moved
that
the
earth
was
not
the
center
of
everything


based
on
previous
works
he
said
that
the
earth
was
a
planet
and
all
the
planets
moved
around
the
sun
bringing
the
model
back
to
the
light


a
physicist
called
galileo
galilei
built
his
own
telescope
and
used
it
to
look
more
closely
at
the
stars
and
planets
for
the
first
time


he
agreed
with
copernicus


their
ideas
were
also
improved
by
johannes
and
<collocation>isaac newton</collocation>
who
came
up
with
the
theory
of
gravity


at
this
time
the
catholic
church
decided
that
galileo
was
wrong


the
pope
gave
the
order
to
lock
galileo
up
in
his
house
and
they
did
not
let
him
write
any
more
books
until
he
died


after
galileo
people
made
better
telescopes
and
used
them
to
see
farther
objects
such
as
the
planets
uranus
and
neptune


they
also
saw
how
stars
were
similar
to
our
sun
but
in
a
range
of
colors
and
sizes


they
also
saw
thousands
of
other
<collocation>faraway objects</collocation>
such
as
galaxies
and
nebulae


modern
era
the
century
saw
important
changes
in
astronomy


in
discovered
<collocation>radio emission</collocation>
from
outside
the
earth
when
trying
to
isolate
a
source
of
noise
in
radio
communications
marking
the
birth
of
radio
astronomy
and
the
first
attempts
at
using
another
part
of
the
<collocation>electromagnetic spectrum</collocation>
to
observe
the
sky


those
parts
of
the
<collocation>electromagnetic spectrum</collocation>
that
the
atmosphere
did
not
block
were
now
opened
up
to
astronomy
allowing
more
discoveries
to
be
made


the
opening
of
this
new
window
on
the
universe
saw
the
discovery
of
entirely
new
things
for
example
pulsars
which
sent
regular
pulses
of
radio
waves
out
into
space


the
waves
were
first
thought
to
be
alien
in
origin
because
the
pulses
were
so
regular
that
it
implied
an
artificial
source


the
period
after
<collocation>world war</collocation>
saw
more
observatories
where
large
and
accurate
telescopes
are
built
and
operated
at
good
observing
sites
normally
by
governments


for
example
bernard
began
radio
astronomy
at
bank
using
leftover
military
radar
equipment


by
the
site
had
the
largest
radio
telescope
in
the
world


similarly
the
end
of
the
saw
the
start
of
the
building
of
dedicated
observatories
at
in
hawaii
a
good
site
for
visible
and
telescopes
thanks
to
its
high
altitude
and
<collocation>clear skies</collocation>


would
eventually
come
to
host
very
large
and
very
accurate
telescopes
like
the
keck
observatory
with
its
mirror


the
next
great
revolution
in
astronomy
was
thanks
to
the
birth
of
rocketry


this
allowed
telescopes
to
be
placed
in
space
on
satellites


telescopes
opened
up
the
universe
to
human
eyes


turbulence
in
the
earth
atmosphere
blurs
images
taken
by
telescopes
an
effect
known
as
seeing


it
is
this
effect
that
makes
stars
twinkle
in
the
sky


as
a
result
the
pictures
taken
by
satellite
telescopes
in
visible
light
for
example
by
the
<collocation>hubble space</collocation>
telescope
are
much
clearer
than
telescopes
even
though
telescopes
are
very
large


space
telescopes
gave
access
for
the
first
time
in
history
to
the
entire
<collocation>electromagnetic spectrum</collocation>
including
rays
that
had
been
blocked
by
the
atmosphere


the
<collocation>gamma rays</collocation>
ultraviolet
light
and
parts
of
the
spectrum
were
all
opened
to
astronomy
as
observing
telescopes
were
launched


as
with
other
parts
of
the
spectrum
new
discoveries
were
made


the
period
from
onwards
can
be
that
satellites
were
launched
to
be
replaced
with
more
accurate
and
better
satellites
causing
the
sky
to
be
mapped
in
nearly
all
parts
of
the
<collocation>electromagnetic spectrum</collocation>


<collocation>future plans</collocation>
making
new
progress
in
astronomy
is
becoming
more
limited
by
the
observatories
and
facilities
being
used
at
this
time


to
make
up
for
these
limitations
astronomers
have
proposed
larger
and
more
ambitious
projects


these
proposals
some
of
which
are
being
examined
already
by
governments
to
see
if
they
will
be
funded
allow
us
to
glimpse
into
what
the
astronomers
are
planning
for
the
future
of
astronomy


discoveries
this
section
all
the
discoveries
that
astronomy
has
made


discoveries
broadly
come
in
two
types
bodies
and
phenomena


bodies
are
things
in
the
universe
whether
it
is
a
planet
like
our
earth
or
a
galaxy
like
our
milky
way


phenomena
are
events
and
happenings
in
the
universe


bodies
for
convenience
this
section
has
been
divided
by
where
these
astronomical
bodies
may
be
found
those
found
around
stars
are
solar
bodies
those
inside
galaxies
are
galactic
bodies
and
everything
else
larger
are
cosmic
bodies


solar
planet
asteroid
comet
galactic
stars
diffuse
objects
nebula
clusters
compact
stars
white
dwarves
neutron
star
black
hole
cosmic
galaxies
clusters


phenomena
phenomena
are
events
and
happenings
in
the
universe


broadly
they
can
be
divided
into
three
types
burst
periodic
and
noise


<collocation>burst events</collocation>
are
those
where
there
is
a
sudden
change
in
the
heavens
that
disappears
quickly


these
are
called
bursts
because
they
are
normally
associated
with
large
explosions
producing
a
burst
of
energy


they
include
supernova
nova
periodic
events
are
those
that
happen
regularly
in
a
repetitive
way


the
name
periodic
comes
from
period
which
is
the
length
of
time
required
for
a
wave
to
complete
one
cycle


periodic
phenomena
include
<collocation>pulsar s</collocation>
<collocation>variable star</collocation>
<collocation>noise phenomena</collocation>
tend
to
relate
to
things
that
happened
a
long
time
ago


the
signal
from
these
events
bounce
around
the
universe
until
it
seems
to
come
from
everywhere
and
varies
little
in
intensity


in
this
way
it
resembles
noise
the
background
signal
that
pervades
every
instrument
used
for
astronomy


the
most
common
example
of
noise
is
static
seen
on
<collocation>analog televisions</collocation>


the
principal
astronomical
example
is
<collocation>cosmic background</collocation>
radiation


methods
<collocation>instruments much</collocation>
of
astronomy
is
done
through
observation
of
the
heavens
using
instruments


telescopes
are
the
main
tool
of
observing


they
take
all
the
light
in
a
big
area
and
put
in
into
a
small
area


this
is
like
making
your
eyes
very
big
and
powerful


astronomers
use
telescopes
to
look
at
things
that
are
far
away
and
dim


telescopes
make
objects
look
bigger
closer
brighter


<collocation>spectrometers study</collocation>
the
different
wavelengths
of
light


this
shows
what
something
is
made
of


many
telescopes
are
in
satellites


they
are
space
observatories


techniques
there
are
way
astronomers
can
get
better
pictures
of
the
heavens


light
from
a
distant
source
reaches
a
sensor
and
gets
measured
normally
by
a
human
eye
or
a
camera


for
very
<collocation>dim sources</collocation>
there
may
not
be
enough
light
particles
coming
from
the
source
for
it
to
be
seen


one
technique
that
astronomers
have
for
making
it
visible
is
using
integration
which
is
like
longer
exposures
in
photography


integration
astronomical
sources
do
not
move
much
only
the
rotation
and
movement
of
the
earth
causes
them
to
move
across
the
heavens


as
light
particles
reach
the
camera
over
time
they
hit
the
same
place
making
it
brighter
and
more
visible
then
the
background
until
it
can
be
seen


telescopes
at
most
observatories
and
satellite
instruments
can
normally
track
a
source
as
it
moves
across
the
heavens
making
the
star
appear
still
to
the
telescope
and
allowing
longer
exposures


also
images
can
be
taken
on
different
nights
so
exposures
span
hours
days
or
even
months


in
the
digital
era
pictures
of
the
sky
can
be
added
together
by
computer
which
overlays
the
images
after
correcting
for
movement


aperture
synthesis
with
radio
telescopes
smaller
telescopes
can
be
combined
together
to
create
a
big
one
which
works
like
one
as
big
as
the
distance
between
the
two
smaller
telescopes


<collocation>adaptive optics</collocation>
<collocation>adaptive optics</collocation>
means
changing
the
shape
of
the
mirror
or
lens
while
looking
at
something
to
see
it
better


<collocation>data analysis</collocation>
<collocation>data analysis</collocation>
is
the
process
of
getting
more
information
out
of
an
<collocation>astronomical observation</collocation>
than
by
simply
looking
at
it


the
observation
is
first
stored
as
data


this
data
will
then
have
various
techniques
applied
to
it
to
analyze
it
out
of
which
we
may
get
an
answer


fourier
analysis
fourier
analysis
in
mathematics
can
show
if
an
observation
over
a
length
of
time
is
changing
periodically
changes
like
a
wave


if
so
it
can
extract
the
frequencies
and
the
type
of
wave
pattern
and
find
many
things
including
new
planets


fields
astronomy
is
a
very
large
subject
with
many
different
things
to
study


many
<collocation>astronomers specialise</collocation>
in
particular
areas
of
astronomy
called
fields


fields
are
often
themselves
further
into
and
so
on


astronomers
assign
fields
based
on
what
they
perceive
to
be
the
largest
differences
between
different
bodies
and
phenomena


however
as
astronomers
learn
more
about
the
universe
they
often
notice
that
things
which
they
thought
were
different
at
first
turn
out
to
be
similar
and
things
which
were
similar
turn
out
to
be
different


as
a
result
fields
in
astronomy
are
constantly
changing


a
good
example
of
changing
fields
comes
from
pulsars
which
pulse
regularly
in
radio
waves


these
turned
out
to
be
similar
to
some
but
not
all
of
a
type
of
bright
source
in
called
a
low
mass
binary


it
turned
out
that
all
pulsars
and
some
are
neutron
stars
and
that
the
differences
were
due
to
the
environment
in
which
the
neutron
star
was
found


those
that
were
not
neutron
stars
turned
out
to
be
black
holes


because
of
its
changing
nature
the
organization
of
astronomy
can
be
confusing
even
to
astronomers


there
are
also
many
terms
which
have
both
modern
and
older
meanings


this
section
attempts
to
provide
an
overview
of
the
important
fields
of
astronomy
their
period
of
importance
and
the
terms
used
to
describe
them


it
should
be
noted
that
astronomy
in
the
modern
era
has
been
divided
mainly
by
<collocation>electromagnetic spectrum</collocation>
although
there
is
some
evidence
this
is
changing


for
convenience
the
fields
are
grouped
by
the
major
difference
that
inspired
them


fields
by
body
solar
astronomy
main
sun
solar
astronomy
is
the
study
of
the
sun


the
sun
is
the
closest
star
to
earth
at
around
million
miles
away


it
is
the
easiest
to
observe
in
detail


observing
the
sun
can
help
us
understand
how
other
stars
work
and
are
formed


changes
in
the
sun
can
affect
the
weather
and
climate
on
earth


a
stream
of
charged
particles
called
the
solar
wind
is
constantly
sent
off
from
the
sun


the
solar
wind
hitting
the
earth
magnetic
field
causes
the
northern
lights


studying
the
sun
helped
people
understand
how
nuclear
fusion
works


<collocation>planetary astronomy</collocation>
<collocation>planetary astronomy</collocation>
is
the
study
of
planets
moons
dwarf
planets
comets
and
asteroids
as
well
as
other
small
objects
that
orbit
stars


the
planets
of
our
own
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
have
been
studied
in
depth
by
many
visiting
spacecraft
such
as
saturn
and
the

is
the
study
of
<collocation>distant galaxies</collocation>


studying
<collocation>distant galaxies</collocation>
is
the
best
way
of
learning
about
our
own
galaxy
as
the
gases
and
stars
in
our
own
galaxy
make
it
difficult
to
observe


<collocation>galactic astronomers</collocation>
attempt
to
understand
the
structure
of
galaxies
and
how
they
are
formed
through
the
use
of
different
types
of
telescopes
and
computer
simulations

hydrodynamics
done
in
the
presence
of
<collocation>magnetic fields</collocation>
where
hydrodynamics
is
the
<collocation>mathematical modelling</collocation>
of
fluid

hydrodynamics
is
already
useful
in
astronomy
for
mathematically
modelling
how
gases
behave
as
gases
behave
like
fluids


strong
<collocation>magnetic fields</collocation>
found
around
many
bodies
can
drastically
change
how
these
gases
behave
affecting
things
from
star
formation
to
the
flows
of
gases
around
compact
stars
making
a
very
important
and
useful
tool
in
astronomy

gravitational
<collocation>wave astronomy</collocation>
is
the
study
of
the
universe
in
the
gravitational
wave
spectrum


so
far
all
astronomy
that
has
been
done
has
used
the
<collocation>electromagnetic spectrum</collocation>


<collocation>gravitational waves</collocation>
are
ripples
in
spacetime
emitted
by
very
dense
objects
changing
shape
which
include
white
dwarves
neutron
stars
and
black
holes


because
no
one
has
been
able
to
detect
<collocation>gravitational waves</collocation>
directly
the
impact
of
gravitational
<collocation>wave astronomy</collocation>
has
been
very
limited

architecture
is
the
science
of
the
design
of
structures
or
buildings
such
as
houses
places
of
worship
office
buildings


architecture
is
also
the
profession
of
an
architect


a
person
must
study
at
an
institution
of
higher
education
to
become
an
architect


architecture
can
be
about
small
designs
such
as
a
garage
or
large
designs
such
as
a
whole
city


architecture
often
overlaps
with
civil
engineering
and
architects
and
civil
engineers
often
work
together

history
romanesque
groin
vault
in
the
past
people
built
huts
and
wood
houses
to
protect
themselves
from
the
weather


for
safety
they
were
often
close
together


great
civilizations
like
the
ancient
egyptians
built
large
temples
and
structures
like
the
great
pyramids
of


the
ancient
greeks
and
romans
made
what
we
now
call
classical
architecture


the
romans
working
over
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
copied
the
arch
from
the
who
copied
it
from
the


the
stone
columns
which
still
hold
up
so
many
important
buildings
like
the
parthenon
in
athens
were
simply
copied
from
the
first
<collocation>wooden posts</collocation>


pyramids
in
classical
architecture
was
very
formal
it
always
obeyed
laws


it
used
symmetry
which
really
means
balance
and
it
used
proportion
which
means
keeping
shapes
in
certain
ways


the
golden
mean
was
a
rule
or
law
which
said
to
put
it
very
simply
if
you
are
making
a
room
or
any
other
thing
it
will
work
best
if
you
always
make
the
long
side
times
longer
than
the
short
side


there
are
many
laws
in
classical
architecture
like
how
high
the
middle
of
an
arched
bridge
needs
to
be
which
depends
on
how
wide
the
bridge
needs
to
be


these
laws
were
learned
from
thousands
of
years
of
experience
and
they
are
as
true
today
as
they
were
<collocation>years ago</collocation>


in
some
parts
of
the
world
like
india
the
architecture
is
famous
for
carving
the
stone
on
temples
and
palaces


different
<collocation>architectural styles</collocation>
were
made
in
china
japan
<collocation>southeast asia</collocation>
africa
mexico
and
central
and
south
america


later
people
in
western
europe
in
the
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>
made
<collocation>romanesque architecture</collocation>
then
gothic
architecture


gothic
buildings
have
tall
pointed
windows
and
arches


many
churches
have
gothic
architecture


castles
were
also
built
at
this
time


in
eastern
europe
churches
usually
had
domes


people
added
their
own
ideas
and
decoration
to
the
classical
architecture
of
the
past


the
renaissance
brought
a
return
to
classical
ideas


there
can
be
many
different
kinds
of
styles
to
architecture
such
as
the
curved
dome
on
the
museum
in
<collocation>new york</collocation>
city
in
the
late
century
with
the
industrial
revolution
people
began
to
invent
machines
to
make
things
quickly
and
cheaply


many
factories
and
mills
were
built
during
or
after
this
revolution


decades
later
in
the
<collocation>victorian era</collocation>
architects
like
george
fowler
jones
and
burton
still
followed
the
gothic
style
to
build
new
churches


up
to
this
point
buildings
were
limited
in
size
and
style
by
the
strength
of
the
wood
and
masonry
used
to
construct
them


gothic
cathedrals
were
among
the
largest
buildings
because
the
gothic
arch
when
combined
with
buttresses
allowed
stone
buildings
to
be
built
taller


for
example
the
cathedral
in
germany
is
over
feet
tall


however
building
with
stone
has
its
limits
and
building
too
tall
could
result
in
collapse
an
example
of
which
is
the
cathedral
which
was
never
completed


new
technology
allows
new
kinds
of
buildings
such
as
for
the
tower
in
chicago
towards
the
end
of
the
century
with
a
second
industrial
revolution
steel
became
much
cheaper


architects
began
to
use
inventions
like
<collocation>metal girders</collocation>
and
reinforced
concrete
to
build


an
example
is
the
<collocation>eiffel tower</collocation>
in
paris
