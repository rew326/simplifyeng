is
more
commonly
used


in
algebra
multiplying
y
by
z
or
y
times
z
can
be
written
in
ways
y
z
y
z
y
z
or
just


the
multiplication
symbol
is
usually
not
used
because
it
looks
too
much
like
the
letter
x
which
is
often
used
as
a
variable


also
when
multiplying
a
larger
expression
parentheses
can
be
used
y
z


when
we
multiply
a
number
and
a
letter
in
algebra
we
write
the
number
in
front
of
the
letter
y


when
the
number
is
then
the
is
not
written
because
times
any
number
is
that
number
y
y
and
so
it
is
not
needed


functions
and
graphs
linear
equation
for
y
an
important
part
of
algebra
is
the
study
of
functions
since
functions
often
appear
in
equations
that
we
are
trying
to
solve


a
function
is
like
a
box
you
can
put
a
number
or
numbers
into
and
get
a
certain
number
out


when
using
functions
graphs
can
be
powerful
tools
in
helping
us
to
study
the
solutions
to
equations


a
graph
is
a
picture
that
shows
all
the
values
of
the
variables
that
make
the
equation
or
inequality
true


usually
this
is
easy
to
make
when
there
are
only
one
or
two
variables


the
graph
is
often
a
line
and
if
the
line
does
not
bend
or
go
straight
it
can
be
described
by
the
basic
formula
y
b


the
variable
b
is
the
of
the
graph
where
the
line
crosses
the
<collocation>vertical axis</collocation>
and
m
is
the
slope
or
of
the
line


this
formula
applies
to
the
coordinates
of
a
graph
where
each
point
on
the
line
is
written
x
y


in
some
math
problems
like
the
equation
for
a
line
there
can
be
more
than
one
variable
x
and
y
in
this
case


to
find
points
on
the
line
one
variable
is
changed


the
variable
that
is
changed
is
called
the
independent
variable


then
the
math
is
done
to
make
a
number


the
number
that
is
made
is
called
the
dependent
variable


most
of
the
time
the
independent
variable
is
written
as
x
and
the
dependent
variable
is
written
as
y
for
example
in
y


this
is
often
put
on
a
graph
using
an
x
axis
going
left
and
right
and
a
y
axis
going
up
and
down


it
can
also
be
written
in
function
form
f
x


so
in
this
example
we
could
put
in
for
x
and
get
y


put
in
for
x
would
get
y


and
for
x
would
get
y


so
there
would
be
a
line
going
thru
the
points
and
as
seen
in
the
graph
to
the
right


if
x
has
a
power
of
it
is
a
straight
line


if
it
is
squared
or
some
other
power
it
will
be
curved


if
it
uses
an
inequality
or
then
usually
part
of
the
graph
is
shaded
either
above
or
below
the
line


rules
of
algebra
in
algebra
there
are
a
few
rules
that
can
be
used
for
further
understanding
of
equations


these
are
called
the
rules
of
algebra


while
these
rules
may
seem
senseless
or
obvious
it
is
wise
to
understand
that
these
properties
do
not
hold
throughout
all
branches
of
mathematics


therefore
it
will
be
useful
to
know
how
these
<collocation>axiomatic rules</collocation>
are

them

an
atom
is
the
basic
unit
that
makes
up
all
matter


there
are
many
different
types
of
atoms
each
with
its
own
name
mass
and
size


these
different
types
of
atoms
are
called
chemical
elements


the
chemical
elements
are
organized
on
the
<collocation>periodic table</collocation>


examples
of
elements
are
hydrogen
and
gold


atoms
are
very
small
but
the
exact
size
changes
depending
on
the
element


atoms
range
from
to
in
width


one
is
around
times
smaller
than
the
width
of
a
human
hair


this
makes
atoms
impossible
to
see
without
special
tools


equations
must
be
used
to
see
the
way
they
work
and
how
they
interact
with
other
atoms


atoms
come
together
to
make
molecules
or
particles
for
example
two
hydrogen
atoms
and
one
oxygen
atom
combine
to
make
a
water
molecule
a
form
of
a
chemical
reaction


atoms
themselves
are
made
up
of
three
kinds
of
smaller
particles
called
protons
neutrons
and
electrons


the
protons
and
neutrons
are
in
the
middle
of
the
atom


they
are
called
the
nucleus


the
nucleus
is
surrounded
by
a
cloud
of
electrons
with
a
negative
charge
which
are
bound
to
the
nucleus
by
an
electromagnetic
force


protons
and
neutrons
are
made
up
of
even
smaller
particles
called
quarks


electrons
are
elementary
or
fundamental
particles
they
can
not
be
split
into
smaller
parts


the
number
of
protons
neutrons
and
electrons
an
atom
has
determines
what
element
it
is


hydrogen
for

the
element
sulfur

history
the
word
atom
comes
from
the
greek
broken
link
indivisible
indivisible
from
not
and
a
cut


the
first
historical
mention
of
the
word
atom
came
from
works
by
the
greek
philosopher
around


atomic
theory
stayed
as
a
mostly
philosophical
subject
with
not
much
actual
<collocation>scientific investigation</collocation>
or
study
until
the
development
of
chemistry
in
the


in
french
chemist
defined
the
term
element
for
the
first
time


he
said
that
an
element
was
any
basic
substance
that
could
not
be
broken
down
into
other
substances
by
the
methods
of
chemistry


any
substance
that
could
be
broken
down
was
a
compound


in
english
philosopher
john
dalton
suggested
that
elements
were
tiny
solid
spheres
made
of
atoms


dalton
believed
that
all
atoms
of
the
same
element
have
the
same
mass


he
said
that
compounds
are
formed
when
atoms
of
more
than
one
element
combine


according
to
dalton
in
a
compound
atoms
of
different
elements
always
combine
the
same
way


in
british
scientist
robert
brown
looked
at
<collocation>pollen grains</collocation>
in
water
and
used
dalton
atomic
theory
to
describe
patterns
in
the
way
they
moved


this
was
called
motion


in
albert
einstein
used
mathematics
to
prove
that
the
seemingly
random
movements
were
down
to
the
reactions
of
atoms
and
by
doing
so
he
conclusively
proved
the
existence
of
the
atom


in
scientist
published
the
first
version
of
the
<collocation>periodic table</collocation>


the
<collocation>periodic table</collocation>
groups
atoms
by
their
atomic
number
how
many
protons
they
have


this
is
usually
the
same
as
the
number
of
electrons


elements
in
the
same
column
or
period
usually
have
similar
properties


for
example
helium
neon
argon
krypton
and
xenon
are
all
in
the
same
column
and
have
very
similar
properties


all
these
elements
are
gases
that
have
no
color
and
no
smell


together
they
are
known
as
the
<collocation>noble gases</collocation>


the
physicist
was
the
first
man
to
discover
electrons


this
happened
while
he
was
working
with
<collocation>cathode rays</collocation>
in


he
realized
they
had
a
negative
charge
unlike
protons
positive
and
neutrons
no
charge


created
the
plum
pudding
model
which
stated
that
an
atom
was
like
plum
pudding
the
dried
fruit
electrons
were
stuck
in
a
mass
of
pudding
protons


in
a
scientist
named
<collocation>ernest rutherford</collocation>
used
the
geiger
experiment
to
prove
that
most
of
an
atom
is
in
a
very
small
space
called
the
atomic
nucleus


rutherford
took
a
photo
plate
and
surrounded
it
with
gold
foil
and
then
shot
alpha
particles
at
it


many
of
the
particles
went
through
the
gold
foil
which
proved
that
atoms
are
mostly
empty
space


electrons
are
so
small
they
make
up
only
of
an
atom
mass


<collocation>ernest rutherford</collocation>
in
shortly
before
he
won
the
nobel
prize
for
physics


in
introduced
the
model


this
model
showed
that
electrons
orbit
the
nucleus
in
fixed
circular
orbits


this
was
more
accurate
than
the
rutherford
model


however
it
was
still
not
completely
right


improvements
to
the
model
have
been
made
since
it
was
first
introduced


in
chemist
frederick
found
that
some
elements
in
the
<collocation>periodic table</collocation>
had
more
than
one
kind
of
atom


for
example
any
atom
with
protons
should
be
a
helium
atom


usually
a
helium
nucleus
also
contains
two
neutrons


however
some
helium
atoms
have
only
one
neutron


this
means
they
are
still
helium
as
the
element
is
defined
by
the
number
of
protons
but
they
are
not
normal
helium
either


called
an
atom
like
this
with
a
different
number
of
neutrons
an
isotope


to
get
the
name
of
the
isotope
we
look
at
how
many
protons
and
neutrons
it
has
in
its
nucleus
and
add
this
to
the
name
of
the
element


so
a
helium
atom
with
two
protons
and
one
neutron
is
called
and
a
carbon
atom
with
six
protons
and
six
neutrons
is
called


however
when
he
developed
his
theory
could
not
be
certain
neutrons
actually
existed


to
prove
they
were
real
physicist
james
and
a
team
of
others
created
the
<collocation>mass spectrometer</collocation>


the
<collocation>mass spectrometer</collocation>
actually
measures
the
mass
and
weight
of
individual
atoms


by
doing
this
proved
that
to
account
for
all
the
weight
of
the
atom
neutrons
must
exist


in
german
chemist
otto
became
the
first
person
to
create
<collocation>nuclear fission</collocation>
in
a
laboratory


he
discovered
this
by
chance
when
he
was
shooting
neutrons
at
a
uranium
atom
hoping
to
create
a
new
isotope


however
he
noticed
that
instead
of
a
new
isotope
the
uranium
simply
changed
into
a
barium
atom


this
was
the
world
first
recorded
<collocation>nuclear fission</collocation>
reaction


this
discovery
eventually
led
to
the
creation
of
the
atomic
bomb


further
into
the
century
physicists
went
deeper
into
the
mysteries
of
the
atom


using
<collocation>particle accelerators</collocation>
they
discovered
that
protons
and
neutrons
were
actually
made
of
other
particles
called
quarks


the
most
accurate
model
so
far
comes
from
the
equation


realized
that
the
electrons
exist
in
a
cloud
around
the
nucleus
called
the
electron
cloud


in
the
electron
cloud
it
is
impossible
to
know
exactly
where
electrons
are


the
equation
is
used
to
find
out
where
an
electron
is
likely
to
be


this
area
is
called
the
electron
orbital


structure
and
parts
parts
the
complex
atom
is
made
up
of
three
main
particles
the
proton
the
neutron
and
the
electron


the
isotope
of
hydrogen
has
no
neutrons
and
a
positive
hydrogen
ion
has
no
electrons


these
are
the
only
known
exceptions
all
other
atoms
have
at
least
one
proton
neutron
and
electron
each


electrons
are
by
far
the
smallest
of
the
three
their
mass
and
size
is
too
small
to
be
measured
using
current
technology


they
have
a
negative
charge


protons
and
neutrons
are
of
similar
size
to
each
other
protons
are
positively
charged
and
neutrons
have
no
charge


most
atoms
have
a
neutral
charge
because
the
number
of
protons
positive
and
electrons
negative
are
the
same
the
charges
balance
out
to
zero


however
in
ions
different
number
of
electrons
this
is
not
always
the
case
and
they
can
have
a
positive
or
a
negative
charge


protons
and
neutrons
are
made
out
of
quarks
of
two
types
up
quarks
and
down
quarks


a
proton
is
made
of
two
up
quarks
and
one
down
quark
and
a
neutron
is
made
of
two
down
quarks
and
one
up
quark


nucleus
the
nucleus
is
in
the
middle
of
an
atom


it
is
made
up
of
protons
and
neutrons


usually
in
nature
two
things
with
the
same
charge
repel
or
shoot
away
from
each
other


so
for
a
long
time
it
was
a
mystery
to
scientists
how
the
positively
charged
protons
in
the
nucleus
stayed
together


they
solved
this
by
finding
a
particle
called
a
gluon


its
name
comes
from
the
word
glue
as
act
like
atomic
glue
sticking
the
protons
together
using
the
strong
nuclear
force


it
is
this
force
which
also
holds
the
quarks
together
that
make
up
the
protons
and
neutrons


a
diagram
showing
the
main
difficulty
in
nuclear
fusion
the
fact
that
protons
which
have
positive
charges
repel
each
other
when
forced
together


the
number
of
neutrons
in
relation
to
protons
defines
whether
the
nucleus
is
stable
or
goes
through
<collocation>radioactive decay</collocation>


when
there
are
too
many
neutrons
or
protons
the
atom
tries
to
make
the
numbers
the
same
by
getting
rid
of
the
extra
particles


it
does
this
by
emitting
radiation
in
the
form
of
alpha
beta
or
<collocation>gamma decay</collocation>


nuclei
can
change
through
other
means
too


<collocation>nuclear fission</collocation>
is
when
the
nucleus
splits
into
two
smaller
nuclei
releasing
a
lot
of
stored
energy


this
release
energy
is
what
makes
<collocation>nuclear fission</collocation>
useful
for
making
bombs
and
electricity
in
the
form
of
nuclear
power


the
other
way
nuclei
can
change
is
through
nuclear
fusion
when
two
nuclei
join
together
or
fuse
to
make
a
heavier
nucleus


this
process
requires
extreme
amounts
of
energy
in
order
to
overcome
the
electrostatic
repulsion
between
the
protons
as
they
have
the
same
charge


such
high
energies
are
most
common
in
stars
like
our
sun
which
fuses
hydrogen
for
fuel


electrons
main
electron
electrons
orbit
or
go
around
the
nucleus


they
are
called
the
atom
electron
cloud


they
are
attracted
towards
the
nucleus
because
of
the
electromagnetic
force


electrons
have
a
negative
charge
and
the
nucleus
always
has
a
positive
charge
so
they
attract
each
other


around
the
nucleus
some
electrons
are
further
out
than
others


these
are
called
electron
shells


in
most
atoms
the
first
shell
has
two
electrons
and
all
after
that
have
eight


exceptions
are
rare
but
they
do
happen
and
are
difficult
to
predict


the
further
away
the
electron
is
from
the
nucleus
the
weaker
the
pull
of
the
nucleus
on
it


this
is
why
bigger
atoms
with
more
electrons
react
more
easily
with
other
atoms


the
electromagnetism
of
the
nucleus
is
not
enough
to
hold
onto
their
electrons
and
they
lose
them
to
the
strong
attraction
of
smaller
atoms


<collocation>radioactive decay</collocation>
main
<collocation>radioactive decay</collocation>
some
elements
and
many
isotopes
have
what
is
called
an
unstable
nucleus


this
means
the
nucleus
is
either
too
big
to
hold
itself
together
or
has
too
many
protons
electrons
or
neutrons
