a

is
a
perfectly
flat
surface
extending
in
all
directions


try
to
imagine
the
ceiling
of
a
room
only
extended
into
all
directions
infinitely


a
plane
has
two
dimensions
length
and
width


all
planes
are
flat
surfaces


if
a
surface
is
not
flat
it
is
called
a
curved
surface


the
tool
plane
can
be
used
to
create
a
flat
level
surface
like
the
mathematical
plane
therefore

a
plane
is

in

a
plane
is
a
fundamental
object


intuitively
it
looks
like
a
flat
infinite
sheet
of
paper


there
are
several
definitions
of
the
plane


they
are
equivalent
in
the
sense
of
euclidean
geometry
but
they
can
be
extended
in
different
ways
to
define
objects
in
other
areas
of
mathematics


the
only
dimensional
figure
in
our
dimensional
world
is
a
shadow


in
some
areas
of
mathematics
such
as
plane
geometry
or
computer
graphics
the
whole
space
in
which
the
work
is
carried
out
is
a
single
plane


in
such
situations
the
definite
article
is
used
the
plane


many
<collocation>fundamental tasks</collocation>
in
geometry
trigonometry
and
graphing
are
performed
in
the
two
dimensional
space
or
in
other
words
in
the
plane


euclidean
geometry
a
plane
is
a
surface
such
that
given
any
three
distinct
points
on
the
surface
the
surface
also
contains
all
of
the
straight
lines
that
pass
through
any
two
of
them


one
can
introduce
a
coordinate
system
on
a
given
plane
in
order
to
label
every
point
on
it
with
a
unique
ordered
pair
which
is
composed
of
two
numbers
and
is
the
coordinate
of
the
point


within
any
euclidean
space
a
plane
is
uniquely
determined
by
any
of
the
following
combinations
three
points
which
are
not
lying
on
the
same
line
a
line
and
a
point
not
on
the
line
two
different
lines
which
intersect
two
different
lines
which
are
parallel
a
vector
normal
to
the
plane
and
a
distance
from

an
angle
is
the
space
between
two
lines
that
meet
each
other


when
two
lines
meet
at
a
point
an
angle
is
formed


the
two
lines
are
called
the
arms
of
the
angle


to
measure
the
size
of
an
angle
we
use
degree


degree
is
a
standard
unit


degree
is
denoted
by
the
symbol


a
degree
can
be
divided
into
minutes
and
a
minute
can
be
also
be
divided
into
seconds


in
mathematics
angles
are
usually
measured
in


types
of
angles
an
<collocation>acute angle</collocation>
is
an
angle
less
than


a
right
angle
is
an
angle
equal
to


an
obtuse

is
an
angle
greater
than

less
than


a
straight
angle
or
straight
line
is
an
angle
equal
to


a
<collocation>reflex angle</collocation>
is
an
angle
greater
than
but
less
than


supplementary
angles
are
two
angles
with
the
sum
equal
to


two
angles
that
sum
to
one
right
angle
are
called
complementary
angles


two
angles
that
sum
to
one
full
circle
are
called
angles
or
<collocation>conjugate angles</collocation>


people
usually
use
a
protractor
to
measure
and
draw
angles


sometimes
people
use
an
angle
ruler
or
a
protractor
to
measure
angles
