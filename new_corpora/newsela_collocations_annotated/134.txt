not
at
all
related
to
norwegian


in
some
parishes
in
the
far
north
they
make
up
the
majority
of
people


many
now
live
outside
the
homeland
mostly
in
oslo
and
other
big
cities


earlier
people
were
forced
to
speak
norwegian
in
school


now
is
taught
as
the
first
language
in
school
for
children
and
norwegian
is
the

in

norwegian
culture
norwegian
culture
can
be
compared
to
english
culture
in
the
way
that
it
is
considered
a
bad
thing
to
show
off
as
opposed
to
the
us
where
this
is
more
acceptable


this
is
a
big
aspect
of
norwegian
culture
and
it
is
related
to
the
philosophy
of


because
of
this
people
will
understate
things
for
example
if
a
norwegian
says
something
is
good
or
nice
it
usually
means
that
it
really
great


norway
also
has
a
rich
cultural
history
going
all
the
way
back
to
the
age
of
the
vikings
and
up
to
today
with
several
writers
and
painters


the
most
famous
norwegian
cultural
person
is
probably
who
wrote
several
plays
and
novels
and
they
often
upset
people
because
he
challenged
popular
attitudes
such
as
the
role
of
women


other
famous
writers
include
knut
lie
and
more
recently


famous
painters
and
musicians
includes
munch
<collocation>ole bull</collocation>
and


norwegian
politics
in
norway
power
is
shared
between
three
branches
the
justice
sector
the
government
and
the
parliament


norway
also
has
a
king
but
he
does
not
have
any
real
power
and
acts
as
a
symbol
and
ambassador


this
form
of
government
is
called
a
<collocation>constitutional monarchy</collocation>


elections
are
held
every
four
years
and
the
winner
of
the
election
is
the
party
or
coalition
which
gets
the
most
votes
and
seats
in
the

after
the

the

as

as

here
is
a
short
summary
of
the
biggest
political
parties
in
norway
from
left
to
right
on
the
political
axis
red
a
revolutionary
socialist
party
which
works
for
equality
of
income
labor
rights
a
controlled
economy
and
feminism


socialist
left
party
the
party
is
not
very
radical
and
is
very
concerned
with
environmental
issues
as
well
as
education


the
party
is
traditionally
regarded
as
the
teacher
party
because
of
their
focus
on
learning
and
school


one
might
call
more
of
a
social
democratic
party
than
a
socialist
party
since
their
socialist
views
have
faded
over
the
years


they
were
a
lot
more
radical
in
the
and
and
the
name
has
stuck


norwegian
labor
party
the
labor
party
is
the
biggest
party
in
norway


they
work
for
a
strong
economy
with
a
few
regulations
on
private
businesses
and
are
traditionally
the
party
for
workers
securing
labor
rights
and
the
welfare
state


centre
party
the
centre
party
used
to
be
known
as
the
farmer
party
but
they
no
longer
use
this
name
but
still
they
are
mostly
popular
in
the
countryside
and
other
rural
regions
since
they
work
for
the
environment
and
protection
of
norwegian
farmers


for
example
meat
from
foreign
countries
costs
more
so
that
people
will
buy
from
norwegian
farmers


this
is
called


liberal
party
even
though
it
is
called
left
it
is
actually
a
social
liberal
party
and
they
belong
to
the
side
of
norwegian
politics
their
influence
have
faded
over
the
years
and
at
the
elections
they
almost
got
thrown
out
of
the
parliament
because
they
barely
won
enough
seats


they
work
for
liberal
rights
like
freedom
of
speech
gender
equality
and
they
are
also
concerned
with
environment


because
of
this
they
support
using
public
transport

of
the
right
politics

norwegian
politics
it
is
a

and
is
the
second
biggest
party
in
norway
they
work
for
a
free
market
liberal
rights
and
equality
of
opportunity


they
are
more
friendly
towards
private
businesses
and
support
economic
growth
by
making
taxes
smaller
so
that
more
people
can
start
businesses


progress
party
usually
shortened
to
in
norwegian
the
progress
party
is
a
party
in
norway
and
works
for
stronger
immigration
laws
a
free
market
and
tough
penalties
for
crimes


they
have
been
accused
of
discriminating
foreigners
and
their
opponents
often
call
them
racists
or


they
also
support
private
schools
and
flat
taxes


currently
the
conservative
party
and
the
progress
party
are
working
together
in
a
coalition
government
after
getting
