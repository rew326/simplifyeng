it
seems
that
the
idea
of
an
alphabet
a
script
based
entirely
upon
sound
arose
only
once
and
has
been
copied
and
adapted
to
suit
many
different
languages


although
no
alphabet
fits
its
language
perfectly
it
is
flexible
enough
to
fit
any
language
approximately


it
was
a
unique
invention


our
alphabet
is
called
the
roman
alphabet
as
compared
with
the
cyrillic
and
other


all
of
these
come
from
the
ancient
greek
alphabet
which
dates
back
to
about
to


the
greek
alphabet
was
probably
developed
from
the
<collocation>phoenician script</collocation>
which
appeared
somewhat
earlier
and
had
some
similar


the
phoenicians
spoke
a
semitic
language
usually
called
canaanite


the
semitic
group
of
languages
includes
arabic
maltese
hebrew
and
also
aramaic
the
language
spoken
by
jesus


we
do
not
know
much
about
how
the
idea
arose
but
the
phoenicians
a
trading
people
came
up
with
letters
which
were
adapted
by
the
early
greeks
to
produce
their
alphabet


the
one
big
difference
is
that
the
<collocation>phoenician script</collocation>
had
no
<collocation>pure vowels</collocation>


arabic
script
has
vowels
which
may
be
shown
by
small
marks
above
or
below
the
line


the
oldest
qu
ran
manuscripts
had
no


israeli
children
today
use
texts
with
vowel
dots
added
to
about
the
third
grade


no
ancient
script
or
not
had
<collocation>pure vowels</collocation>
before
the
greeks


the
greek
alphabet
even
has
two
vowels
for
e
and
two
for
o
to
distinguish
between
the
long
and
short
sounds


it
is
fairly
clear
from
this
that
careful
thought
went
into
both
the
<collocation>phoenician invention</collocation>
and
the
greek
adaptation


however
no
details
survive
of
either
process


<collocation>semitic scripts</collocation>
apparently
derive
from
a
script
of
which
only
inscriptions
plus
doubtful
are
known


it
is
thought
by
some
researchers
that
the
original
source
of
this
script
was
the
<collocation>egyptian hieratic</collocation>
script


by
the
late
middle
kingdom
about
hieratic
had
added
some
signs
for
representing
the
consonants
of
foreign
names


egyptian
activity
in
was
at
its
height
at
that
time


a
similar
idea
had
been
suggested
many
years
before


scripts
there
are
a
number
of
scripts
which
have
never
been
deciphered
despite
much
effort


perhaps
the
most
famous
are
the
script
of
the
<collocation>indus valley</collocation>
civilization
and
the
etruscan
script


the
indus
river
civilisation
predates
other
literate
civilisations
on
the
indian
subcontinent
going
back
to
about


their
cities
of
and
were
with
good
drainage


the
script
is
found
on
seal
stones
terracotta
bronze
bone
and
ivory


all
are
brief
and
the
language
is
unknown


the
etruscan
language
used
greek
and
is
found
mainly
on
<collocation>etruscan tombs</collocation>
from
through
to
venice


they
were
an
empire
before
the
romans
who
defeated
them
and
absorbed
their
ideas


all
knowledge
of
their
language
was
lost
except
that
some
of
the
names
on
tomb
memorials
can
be
read
from
the
greek
letters


literacy
it
is
only
in
the
last
years
that
most
people
have
been
able
to
read
and
write
in
europe
and
north
america


in
many
other
parts
of
the
world
this
did
not
happen
until
the
century


until
then
literacy
was
mainly
for
clerics
that
is
people
who
had
training
as
priests


even
wealthy
people
were
often
illiterate
and
used
scribes
to
write
for
them


the
invention
of
printing
came
before
<collocation>mass literacy</collocation>


before
each
book
had
to
be
created
by
hand
so
there
were
few
books
available
compared
to
the
billions
in
the
world

<collocation>mass literacy</collocation>

use

can
refer
to

mostly
it
refers
to

bust
of
plato
plato
was
a
very
important
classical
greek
philosopher


he
lived
from
to


he
was
a
student
of
socrates
and
the
teacher
of
aristotle


plato
wrote
about
many
ideas
in
philosophy
that
are
still
talked
about
today


in
fact
one
modern
philosopher
alfred
north
whitehead
said
that
all
philosophy
since
plato
has
just
been
comments
on
his
works


plato
wrote
his
books
in
the
form
of
dialogues
people
talking
about
ideas
and
sometimes
disagreeing
about
them


this
makes
plato
books
more
interesting
to
read


socrates
is
usually
the
main
person
in
plato
dialogues


usually
socrates
talks
with
people
about
their
ideas
and
tries
to
see
if
they
believe
anything
that
is
illogical


other
people
in
the
stories
often
become
angry
with
socrates
because
of
this


people
who
study
plato
argue
about
whether
socrates
really
said
the
same
things
that
plato
makes
him
say
or
whether
plato
just
used
socrates
as
a
character
to
make
the
ideas
he
was
talking
about
seem
more
important


plato
opposed
the
of
and
insisted
true
justice
and
equality
in
his
work
and
immortality
of
soul
in


one
of
plato
most
famous
works
is
the
republic
in
greek
or
city


in
that
work
he
describes
socrates
vision
of
an
ideal
state


the
method
of
questioning
in
this
dialogue
called
the
<collocation>socratic method</collocation>
is
as
important
as
the
content


the
republic
contains
ideas
of
socrates
socrates
said
it
plato
wrote
it


plato
also
wrote
the
laws


works
by
plato
there
are
many
dialogues
that
were
supposed
to
be
written
by
plato


but
because
he
was
such
a
famous
philosopher
some
later
philosophers
said
that
their
works
were
really
written
by
him
to
make
their
works
seem
more
important


in
the
list
on
this
page
a
work
is
marked
if
scholars
are
not
sure
that
plato
really
wrote
it
and
it
is
marked
if
scholars
generally
agree
that
plato
did
not
really
write
it

way
a

perhaps
written
by

author
or
it
only
treats
one

books
in
this
sense
can
often
be
understood
without

examples
are

books
are
novels
about

some

from

or

are

historical
a
torah
is
a
kind
of
scroll
still
used
today


between
the
written
manuscript
and
the
book
lie
several
inventions


a
book
is
an
industrial
product
but
manuscripts
are


manuscripts
a
common
type
of
manuscript
was
the
scroll
which
was
a
long
sheet
rolled
up


the
sheet
could
have
been
made
of
papyrus
made
by
the
egyptians
by
weaving
the
inner
stems
of
the
papyrus
plant
and
then
hammering
them
together
or
parchment
or
vellum
very
thin
animal
skin
first
used
by
the
ancient
greeks
or
paper
made
from
plant
fibers
invented
by
the
chinese


turning
the
manuscript
into
a
book
required
several
developments


the
codex
the
romans
were
the
first
people
to
put
separate
pieces
of
manuscript
between
covers
to
form
a
codex


this
was
more
convenient
to
handle
and
store
than
scrolls
but
was
not
yet
a
book
as
we
understand
it


printing
scrolls
and
were
written
and
copied
by
hand


the
chinese
invented
woodblock
printing
where
shapes
are
carved
out
of
a
block
of
wood
then
ink
is
applied
to
the
carved
side
and
the
block
is
pressed
onto
the
paper


this
way
of
making
books
was
very
slow
and
so
very
few
people
had
these
kinds
of
books


johannes
was
the
first
to
invent
a
machine
for
printing
the
<collocation>printing press</collocation>
in
the
century


this
involved
more
than
just
a
press
it
involved
the
production
of
movable
metal
type
suitable
for
the
machine
process


initially
the
machines
were
slow
and
needed
a
printer
to
work
with
them


fast
and
automatic
machines
did
not
arrive
until
the
century


paper
and
ink
paper
had
been
invented
in
the
century
but
paper
was
expensive
and
in
short
supply


in
the
century
automated
or
making
of
paper
from
<collocation>wood pulp</collocation>
was
invented


also
there
was
the
invention
of
inks
for
various
purposes
and
machines
driven
by
electricity


the
common
cheap
supply
of
paper
fed
the
faster
machines
and
books
became
cheaper


only
then
could
ordinary
people
afford
to
buy
books


along
with
these
inventions
in
the
century
came
the
idea
of
public
libraries
so
poorer
people
could
get
access
to
the
best
books


also
widespread
free
or
nearly
free
education
swelled
the
number
of
literate
people


binding
printing
was
done
on
large
sheets
of
paper
which
were
then
folded
guillotined
cut
and
sewn
in
sections
and
finally
placed
into
the
covers


all
these
processes
became
done
by
machines
during
the
century


today
today
some
of
the
technologies
have
been
changed
especially
those
involving
illustration
and


however
books
look
much
the
same
as
they
did
with
more
illustration
in
color
but
basically
the
same


that
is
because
experience
has
shown
that
readers
need
certain
things
for
<collocation>pleasurable reading</collocation>


<collocation>graphic design</collocation>
and
are
the

about

a

must
meet
several
conditions
to
be
a

these
are
the
game
has
two
players


the
last
player
to
move
wins


if
a
player
can
not
move
on
his
turn
that
player
loses


players
<collocation>alternate turns</collocation>


the
game
has
an
end


it
can
not
go
on
forever


the
game
can
not
end
in
a
tie
or
draw


there
is
no
information
kept
from
the
players
like
there
is
in
poker
for
example
there
are
no
chance
moves


luck
is
not
a
part
of
the
game


very
few
of
the
games
that
people
play
for
fun
meet
these
conditions


for
example
chess
has
draws


these
games
can
be
represented
by
trees
each
vertex
of
which
is
the
game
resulting
from
a
particular
move
from
the
game
directly
below
it
on
the
tree


these
games
can
be
assigned
game
values


finding
these
game
values
is
of
great
interests
to
cg
theorists
as
is

theoretical
concept
of

in
which

definitions
in

there
are
two
players
called
left

right


a
game
is
something
that
allows
left
and

to
make
moves
to
other
games


for
example
in
the
game
of
chess
there
is
a

could
also

think
of
a

setup


so
each
position
is
also
called
a
game


games
have
the
notation
l
r


l
are
the
games
the
left
player
can
move
to


r
are
the
games
the
right
player
can
move
to


if
you
know
chess
notation
then
the
usual
chess
setup
is
the
game
dots
dots
the
dots
mean
there
are
many
moves
so
not
all
are
shown


chess
is
very
complex


it
is
better
to
think
of
easier
games


nim
for
example
is
much
simpler
to
think
about


nim
is
played
like
this
there
are
zero
or
more
piles
of
counters


on
a
turn
a
player
may
take
as
many
counters
from
one
pile
as
that
player
wants


the
player
who
can
not
make
a
move
loses


the
easiest
game
of
nim
starts
with
no
counters
at
all


in
such
a
case
neither
player
can
move


that
is
shown
as


both
sides
are
empty
because
neither
player
can
move


the
first
player
to
go
can
not
move
and
so
will
lose


in
people
often
write
as
the
symbol
zero


the
game
has
only
one
pile
with
just
one
counter


if
the
left
player
goes
first
that
player
must
take
the
counter
leaving
right
with
no
moves
or


if
instead
right
moves
first
there
will
be
no
more
moves
for
left


so
both
left
and
right
can
make
a
move
to


the
first
player
to
move
will
win


games
equal
to
are
very
important
