about
the
word
gothic
gothic
architecture
was
at
first
called
the
french
style
lang
la
opus


the
word
gothic
was
used
later
during
the
renaissance
as
an
insult


in
fact
the
architecture
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
real
goths
a
german
tribe
who
attacked
rome
in
the
early
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>


an
italian
writer
named
used
the
word
gothic
in
the
because
he
thought
buildings
from
the
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>
were
not
carefully
planned
and
measured
like
renaissance
buildings
or
the
buildings
of
ancient
rome


after
many
other
people
used
the
word
gothic
to
describe
architecture
with
pointed
arches


<collocation>background towns</collocation>
states
and
countries
at
the
end
of
the
century
western
europe
was
split
into
different
states
which
were
beginning
to
become
the
countries
that
are
known
today


the
holy
roman
empire
ruled
a
big
part
of
europe
including
the
modern
countries
of
germany
the
netherlands
belgium
luxembourg
switzerland
austria
eastern
france
and
much
of
northern
italy
apart
from
venice


historians
believe
emperor
charlemagne
began
the
holy
roman
empire
in
ad


the
countries
of
france
and
spain
were
split
into
kingdoms


england
was
ruled
by
a
king
whose
family
also
had
a
lot
of
land
in
france


norway
was
influenced
by
england
while
the
other
scandinavian
countries
and
poland
were
influenced
by
germany


at
that
time
there
was
a
lot
of
trade
between
towns
and
states


this
caused
the
towns
to
grow
larger


germany
holland
and
belgium
had
many
big
towns
that
grew
peacefully
often
trading
with
each
other


because
of
the
peace
and
wealth
of
these
towns
they
showed
their
pride
by
building
huge
<collocation>town halls</collocation>
often
with
very
tall
towers


in
england
and
france
most
people
did
not
live
in
towns


they
lived
on
farms
which
were
often
owned
by
a
rich
nobleman
or
lord


the
house
of
the
lord
was
usually
called
a
manor
house


italy
was
mostly
split
up
into
small
city
states
which
often
fought
each
other


cities
often
had
high
walls
and
many
of
the
houses
built
at
this
time
were
tall
high
towers


the
church
in
western
europe
in
the
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>
almost
everyone
belonged
to
the
roman
catholic
church


the
roman
catholic
church
has
one
head
the
pope


during
the
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>
one
language
was
used
in
churches
all
across
europe
church
latin
which
had
developed
from
ancient
latin


the
churches
of
each
area
had
a
local
ruler
who
came
under
the
pope


this
was
the
bishop


each
bishop
had
a
throne
where
he
could
sit
when
priests
and
people
came
to
him


a
church
which
has
a
bishop
throne
is
called
a
cathedral


cathedrals
were
usually
the
biggest
and
most
beautiful
churches


in
the
early
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>
many
monasteries
were
built
all
over
europe


a
group
of
holy
men
lived
and
worked
and
prayed
there


monks
belonged
to
different
orders
which
had
different
rules


the
biggest
number
of
monasteries
were
homes
to
the
monks
of
the
<collocation>benedictine order</collocation>


their
monasteries
were
generally
in
towns
and
they
often
built
very
big
churches
called
for
the
monks
and
the
townspeople
to
worship
in


other
orders
of
monks
like
the
did
not
live
near
towns


nowadays
their
are
seen
as
beautiful
ruins
in
the
english
countryside


in
france
there
were
also
as
well
as
and
orders


the
great
monastery
at
built
in
the
romanesque
style
was
the
biggest
in
europe


the
abbey
and
other
buildings
were
very
well
planned
so
for
hundreds
of
years
other
monasteries
were
influenced
by
that
plan


in
the
century
francis
of
assisi
started
the
franciscans
who
were
often
called
the
grey
friars
because
of
their
robes


from
them
came
the
dominicans
founded
by
in
and
bologna


the
dominicans
built
a
large
number
of
italy
gothic
churches


northern
france
has
many
famous
cathedrals
like

part
of
the
ruined
abbey
church


many
<collocation>romanesque architecture</collocation>
romanesque
and

abbey
were
planned
like

toledo


almost
every
monastery
had
a
sheltered
cloister
like
this
at
toledo
cathedral
in
spain
where
monks
could
work
on
<collocation>rainy days</collocation>
or
enjoy
the
sun


the
east
end
of
the
abbey
of
is
famous
as
the
first
truly
gothic
building


abbot
and
the
first
gothic
building
abbot
was
the
head
of
a
large
monastery
just
north
of
paris
in
france


the
monastery
had
a
large
church
the
abbey
of
and
also
a
royal
palace
where
the
french
kings
sometimes
stayed


abbot
was
a
close
friend
to
two
kings
louis
vi
and
louis


in
had
the
idea
to
rebuild
the
great
abbey
church
of


he
began
by
changing
the
west
front
or
facade
which
was
about
years
old
and
had
only
one
small
door


grand
design
had
three
big
doors
like
the
arches
on
the
arch
of
in
rome
which
were
to
let
in
all
the
crowds
on
special
holy
days


the
facade
also
had
a
big
round
window
in
the
center
called
a
rose
window
which
was
the
first
one
in
france


abbot
did
not
then
rebuild
the
part
of
the
church
inside
the
west
doors
the
nave
where
most
of
the
ordinary
people
stood


the
next
part
that
he
rebuilt
was
the
eastern
end


abbot
wanted
this
part
to
make
people
think
of
heaven


he
wanted
it
to
be
very
light
and
bright
with
great
big
windows
of
beautifully
<collocation>colored glass</collocation>


to
do
this
he
looked
at
all
the
most
modern
designs
and
all
the
clever
things
that
other
architects
had
done


he
put
all
the
new
ideas
together
in
one
building


it
was
the
first
building
of
the
new
gothic
style


but
of
course
it
was
not
called
gothic
at
this
time


it
was
called
the
french
style


the
new
east
end
was
dedicated
or
given
to
god
on
june


other
architects
soon
copied
the
design
for
other
big
churches
and
cathedrals
in
northern
france


after
abbot
death
the
rest
of
the
church
was
also
rebuilt
in
the
new
style
and
got
two
more
much
larger
and
more
decorated
rose
windows
one
on
either
side


the
style
soon
spread
to
england
and
through
france
the
<collocation>low countries</collocation>
germany
spain
and
northern
of

sicily

and


<collocation>romanesque architecture</collocation>

was
the
style
of
architecture
in
europe
before
the
gothic
style


gothic
architecture
grew
out
of
<collocation>romanesque architecture</collocation>


there
was
not
a
clean
break
between
the
two
styles


many
of
the
features
of
gothic
architecture
did
not
begin
in
the
gothic
period


they
were
already
there
in
<collocation>romanesque architecture</collocation>
and
slowly
changed
to
become
gothic


the
main
changes
were
the
<collocation>pointed arch</collocation>
and
the
flying
buttress


these
two
developments
allowed
many
other
changes
to
happen


romanesque
buildings
had
thick
walls
small
windows
round
arches
and
flat
buttresses


gothic
buildings
had
thinner
walls
larger
windows
pointed
arches
and
large
buttresses


all
the
types
of
buildings
and
the
general
shape
of
the
buildings
were
already
there
in
the
romanesque
period


the
types
of
buildings
were
the
cathedral
church
the
parish
church
the
monastery
the
castle
the
palace
the
great
hall
and
the
gatehouse


before
the
century
the
landmark
building
in
almost
every
town
was
a
church
cathedral
abbey
or
town
hall
with
its
tall
tower
or
spire
rising
high
above
all
the
houses


many
of
these
buildings
were
from
the
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>
and
were
romanesque
or
gothic
in
style


plans
cathedral
plan
showing
parts
of
the
building
the
of
most
gothic
churches
is
shaped
like
a
cross


the
long
nave
makes
the
body
of
the
church
and
crossing
it
the
arms
are
called
the
transept


on
the
other
side
of
the
transept
is
the
which
is
often
called
the
choir
because
that
is
where
the
priest
and
the
choir
sing
the
services


the
nave
usually
has
a
passageway
or
aisle
on
either
side


sometimes
there
are
two
aisles
on
each
side


the
nave
is
usually
a
lot
taller
than
the
aisles
and
has
high
windows
which
light
up
the
central
space


the
upper
part
of
the
building
where
these
windows
are
is
called
the
or
<collocation>clear storey</collocation>


it
is
pronounced
some
gothic
churches
in
germany
and
austria
and
also
milan
cathedral
which
was
built
in
the
german
style
often
have
nave
and
aisles
of
almost
the
same
height
and
are
called
hall
church


the
cathedral
of
stephen
of
vienna
is
an
example


in
some
churches
with
double
aisles
like
notre
dame
paris
the
transept
does
not
stick
out
beyond
the
aisles


in
english
cathedrals
the
always
stick
out
a
long
way
and
sometimes
there
are
two
as
at
<collocation>salisbury cathedral</collocation>

gothic
churches
are
the
most
different

it
is
usually

a
lady
chapel
a
place
to
pray
to
the
virgin
mary
the
mother
of
jesus


in
france
the
eastern
end
is
often
polygonal
and
has
by
a
passage
for
walking
called
an
ambulatory


often
french
churches
have
a
ring
of
chapels
called
a

churches
are
often
like
those
of
france
at
the
eastern

in

is

transept


there
is
usually
just
a

wide
which
gives
the
church
a
very
tall
narrow
look


some
of
the
churches
in
france
and
germany
have
that
are
three
times
as
high
as
they
are
wide


cologne
cathedral
is
an
example


the
tallest
nave
is
at
cathedral
which
is
feet
high


<collocation>westminster abbey</collocation>
is

high


on
the
outside
most
gothic
churches
both
big
and
small
have
at
least
one
tower


in
italy
there
are
domes
on
the
churches
and
the
tower
stands
to
one
side


but
in
most
other
countries
cathedrals
generally
have
two
towers
and
quite
often
have
three


some
have
even
more


cathedral
was
planned
to
have
seven
but
they
were
not
all
built


sometimes
there
is
just
one
tower
with
a
huge
spire
as
at
salisbury


lincoln
cathedral
had
the
<collocation>tallest spire</collocation>
of
the
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>
at
feet
metres


because
a
<collocation>pointed arch</collocation>
points
upwards
it
makes
people
look
upwards


in
gothic
architecture
the
whole
building
is
designed
to
make
people
look
up


there
are
long
narrow
columns
long
narrow
windows
and
high
pointed
roofs


on
the
inside
the
arches
of
the
roof
rise
up
like
branches


on
the
outside
there
are
often
lots
of
<collocation>fancy bits</collocation>
along
the
edge
of
the
roof
and
on
the
tops
of
buttresses
and
above
the
windows


these
are
called
pinnacles


milan
cathedral
has
hundreds
of
them

gothic
architecture
usually
has
a
lot
of
windows


sainte
is
a
famous
example


at
gloucester
cathedral
in
england
the
east
window
is
as
big
as
a
tennis
court


milan
cathedral
also
has
windows
of
about
the
same
size


the
<collocation>flying buttresses</collocation>
which
arch
across
the
roof
of
the
aisle
were
used
to
support
the
roof
above
the
windows
so
the
walls
did
not
have
to
be
so
thick


the
columns
of
the
inside
the
ribs
of
the
vault
or
roof
and
the
<collocation>flying buttresses</collocation>
made
a
strong
stone
skeleton


in
between
these
parts
the
walls
and
the
filling
of
the
vaults
could
be
of
<collocation>lighter thinner</collocation>
material


between
the
<collocation>narrow buttresses</collocation>
the
walls
could
be
opened
up
into
large
windows


through
the
gothic
period
because
of
the
<collocation>pointed arch</collocation>
gothic
windows
were
able
to
change
from
simple
openings
to
very
rich
designs


the
windows
were
very
often
filled
with
stained
glass
which
made
colored
light
in
the
building
and
was
used
for
pictures

the

mean
there
is
no
need
for
thick
walls
to

up


the

at

are
famous
for
