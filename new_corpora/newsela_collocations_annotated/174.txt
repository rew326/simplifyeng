apes
are
also
primates
and
are

humans

are

helping
and
protecting
each
other
and
caring
for
their
offspring

humans

lets
them
use

make

this

important
features
humans
have
a
long
period
of
development
after
birth


partly
this
is
because
they
have
a
great
deal
to
learn


their
life
depends
less
on
instinct
than
other
animals
and
more
on
learning


humans
are
also
born
with
their
brains
not
so
well
developed
as
other
mammals


there
is
a
good
reason
for
this


if
their
brains
were
better
developed
they
would
be
larger
and
this
would
make
birth
more
difficult


in
birth
the
baby
head
has
to
get
through
the
birth
canal
which
is
a
passageway
through
the
mother
pelvis


many
animals
use
signs
and
sounds
to
communicate
with
each
other


but
humans
have
a
special
system
called
language


it
allows
them
to
express
ideas
by
using
words


humans
are
capable
of
making
abstract
ideas
and
communicating
them
to
others


human
language
can
express
things
that
are
not
present
or
talk
about
events
that
are
not
happening
at
that
time


the
things
might
be
elsewhere
and
the
events
may
also
have
occurred
at
another
place
or
time


no
known
animals
have
a
system
of
communication
that
is
as
elaborate
as
human
language


by
using
words
to
communicate
with
each
other
humans
make
complex
communities
with
laws
traditions
and
customs


humans
like
to
understand
the
world
around
them


they
try
to
explain
things
through
myth
science
and
philosophy


wanting
to
understand
things
has
helped
many
humans
make
important
discoveries


humans
are
the
only
species
living
today
known
to
build
fires
to
cook
their
food
and
wear
clothes


humans
use
more
technology
than
any
other
animal
on
earth
ever
has


humans
like
things
that
are
beautiful
and
like
to
make
art
literature
and
music


humans
use
education
and
teaching
to
pass
on
skills
ideas
and
customs
to
the
next
generations


origins
main
human
evolution
humans
are
part
of
the
animal
kingdom


they
are
mammals
which
means
that
they
give
birth
to
their
young
ones
rather
than
laying
eggs
like
reptiles
or
birds
and
females
feed
their
babies
with
breast
milk


humans
belong
to
the
order
of
primates


apes
like
gorillas
and
gibbons
are
also
primates
