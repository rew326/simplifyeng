started
the
project
when
he
was
attending
the
university
of
helsinki


this
eventually
became
the
kernel


shared
the
kernel
on
some
internet
groups
for
users


first
called
the
operating
system


the
name
came
from
joining
up
the
english
words
free
and
freak
and
adding
an
x
to
the
name
because
unix
has
an
x
in
its
name


who
worked
with
at
the
university
was
responsible
for
the
servers
that
was
stored
on


did
not
think
was
a
good
name
so
he
called
the
project
without
asking


later
agreed
that
was
a
better
name
for
his
project


relied
on
software
code
from
at
first


but
with
code
from
the
gnu
system
available
for
free
he
decided
it
would
be
good
for
if
it
could
use
that
code
instead
of
code
from

<collocation>public license</collocation>
is
a
software
license
that
lets
people
change
any
part
of
the
code
they
want
to
as
long
as
they
share
any
changes
they
make
with
the
people
they
give
their
software
to


the
software
from
gnu
was
all
licensed
under
the
gnu
general
<collocation>public license</collocation>
so
and
the
other
people
who
worked
on
could
use
it
too


to
make
the
<collocation>kernel suitable</collocation>
for
use
with
the
code
from
the
gnu
project
started
a
switch
from
his
original
license
which
did
not
allow
people
to
sell
it
to
the
gnu


and
gnu
developers
worked
together
to
integrate
gnu
code
with
to
make
a
free
operating
system


since
thousands
of
programmers
and
companies
have
worked
to

tux
the
<collocation>penguin tux</collocation>
the
penguin
the
mascot
of
is
a
<collocation>cartoon penguin</collocation>
named
tux


when
a
person
sees
the
penguin
on
software
and
hardware
it
means
that
it
will
work
with
and
sometimes
all
systems
that
are
like
unix


the
idea
of
the
penguin
came
from
the
creator
of


the
image
was
made
by
a
man
named
<collocation>larry ewing</collocation>
in
a
competition
to
create
a
logo


the
image
tux
did
not
win
but
it
was
picked
as
a
mascot
later


tux
has
now
become
a
symbol
for
and
sometimes
even
for
open
source


he
can
be
seen
in
many
different
places
and
often
when
people
refer
to
they
think
about
tux


tux
has
even
been
included
in
many
video
games
such
as
super
tux
like
super
tux
racer
where
players
race
tux
down
an

aims
according
to
the
gnome
website
quote
the
gnome
project
provides
two
things
the
gnome
<collocation>desktop environment</collocation>
an
intuitive
and
attractive
desktop
for
users
and
the
gnome
development
platform
an
<collocation>extensive framework</collocation>
for
building
applications
that
integrate
into
the
rest
of
the
desktop


the
gnome
project
puts
heavy
emphasis
on
simplicity
and
making
things
just
work
see
<collocation>kiss principle</collocation>


the
other
aims
of
the
project
are
freedom
to
create
a
<collocation>desktop environment</collocation>
with
source
code
for
under
a
free
software
license


accessibility
to
ensure
the
desktop
can
be
used
by
anyone
regardless
of
<collocation>technical skill</collocation>
or
physical
circumstances


and
localization
to
make
the
desktop
available
in
many
languages


at
the
moment
gnome
is
being
translated
to
languages


to
ensure
ease
of
writing
software
that
integrates
smoothly
with
the
desktop
and
allow
developers
a
free
choice
of
programming
language


organization
to
adhere
to
a
regular
release
cycle
and
maintain
a
disciplined
community
structure


support
to
ensure
backing
from
other
institutions
beyond
the
gnome
community
