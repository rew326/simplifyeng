the
earliest
flowers
were
pollinated
by
insects
such
as
beetles
long
before
bees
first
appeared


bees
are
different
because
they
are
specialized
as
<collocation>pollination agents</collocation>
with
behavioral
and
<collocation>physical modifications</collocation>
that
make
pollination
easier


bees
are
generally
better
at
the
task
than
other
pollinating
insects
such
as
beetles
flies
butterflies
and
<collocation>pollen wasps</collocation>


the
appearance
of
such
floral
specialists
is
believed
to
have
driven
the
<collocation>adaptive radiation</collocation>
of
the
angiosperms
and
in
turn
the
bees
themselves


bees
like
ants
are
a
specialized
form
of
wasp


the
ancestors
of
bees
were
wasps
in
a
family
which
preyed
on
other
insects


the
switch
from
insect
prey
to
pollen
may
have
resulted
from
the
capture
of
prey
insects
that
were
covered
with
pollen
when
they
were
fed
to
the
wasp
larvae


similar
behavior
could
be
switched
to
pollen
collection


this
same
evolutionary
scenario
has
occurred
within
the
wasps
where
the
group
known
as
<collocation>pollen wasps</collocation>
also
evolved
from
predatory
ancestors

divided
into
three
parts
the
head

part

also
like
other
insects
bees
have
three
pairs
of
legs
and

many
bees
are

yellow

orange

black
warning
colors


many
bees
have
stings
like
a
<collocation>hollow needle</collocation>
on
the
rear

their
bodies


if
they
get
confused
angry
or
scared
they
may

a
worker
bee
has
stung
it
dies
after
a
short
while

other
types
of
bee

wasp
can
sting
again


some
people
are
allergic
to
bee
stings

can

a
queen
bee
is
the
most
important
bee
in

will
lay

the
queen
bee
only

her
stinger
to
sting
other

is

the
mother
of
the
worker
bees


she
ate
a

jelly
called
royal
jelly
from
when
she
was
young


worker
bees
are
females
too

they
are
the
bees
that
collect
pollen

flowers

will
