history
of

starting
in
john
and
several
of
his
friends
played
in
a
british
band
called
the
quarrymen


over
the
next
few
years
the
members
of
the
band
changed
and
by
the
band
was
called
the
beatles


they
did
not
have
their
first
hit
until


in
february
their
song
please
please
me
reached
the
number
position
on
the
british
charts


this
was
the
first
of
a
record
british
number
singles


they
first
came
to
the
united
states
in


they
were
met
at
the
airport
by
thousands
of
screaming
american
teenagers


the
beatles
were
so
popular
that
they
were
attacked
by
screaming
fans
everywhere
they
went
around
the
world


the
effect
they
had
on
their
fans
was
known
as


the
beatles
made
their
first
live
american
television
appearance
on
the
ed
show
on
february


about
million
viewers
about
half
of
the
american
population
watched
the
group
perform
on
the
show


beatles
songs
soon
filled
the
top
places
on
the
american
top
chart
a
record
that
has
never
been
matched


after
the
beatles
became
so
popular
in
the
united
states
other
british
bands
such
as
the
rolling
stones
the
animals
the
kinks
and
and
the
pacemakers
had
songs
become
hits
there
as
well


so
many
british
bands
became
popular
after
the
beatles
success
that
this
time
became
known
in
america
as
the
british
invasion


towards
the
mid
the
beatles
became
bolder
with
their
style
of
music


this
largely
started
in
with
the
release
of
the
album
<collocation>rubber soul</collocation>
and
hit
a
peak
in
with
the
release
of
pepper

<collocation>hearts club</collocation>
band
which
was
named
as
the
greatest

of
all

magazine


they
were
also
named
the
most
influential
artists
of
all
time
by
<collocation>rolling stone</collocation>
magazine
because
their
music
clothing
style
and
attitudes
shaped
much
of
what
was
popular
among
young
people
in
the


the
beatles
became
so
popular
that
no
regular
<collocation>concert venue</collocation>
was
big
enough
for
their
concerts


this
led
to
them
playing
the
first
ever
stadium
rock
concert
at
shea
stadium
in
america
to
around
people


the
beatles
stopped
touring
and
playing
live
music
in
because
they
were
sick
of
audiences
screaming
so
loudly
that
their
music
could
not
be
heard


they
were
also
tired
of
the
pressures
of
touring


among
other
things
they
were
so
popular
that
thousands
of
people
would
gather
outside
the
hotels
they
stayed
in
day
and
night
meaning
that
they
could
never
leave
their
rooms
unless
they
were
playing
a
concert


the
beatles
broke
up
in
because
of
the
pressures
of
fame
and
each
member
becoming
more
independent
both
in
their
personal
lives
and
musically


in
the
sets
the
red
album
and
the
blue
album
were
released


these
were
both
on
cd

after
breaking
up

still
very

everywhere
still

for

hindus
believe
in
reincarnation
the
process
where
the
soul
repeatedly
takes
on
a
physical
body
through
being
born
on
earth


ancient
scriptures
of
hinduism
teach
that
the
soul
or
immortal
self
takes
birth
time
and
time
again


the
soul
survives
and
continues
its
long
journey
until
it
is
one
with
god


hindus
believe
that
the
soul
never
dies
but
inhabits
one
body
after

during
its
evolutionary
journey
guided
by
karma


karma
literally
action
is
the
sum
of
one
actions
and
the
force
that
determines
one
next
reincarnation


the
soul
evolves
from
immaturity
to
spiritual
illumination


therefore
each
reincarnating
soul
chooses
a
home
and
a
family
which
can
best
fulfill
its
next
step
of
learning
and
maturation


each
life
on
earth
is
similar
to

class
in

maturation
of
the
soul
on

means
fulfilling
its
worldly
desires
which
can
only
be
experienced
through
a
body


at
death
the
soul
leaves
the
physical
body


but
the
soul
does
not

it
lives
on
in
a
subtle
body
called
the
astral
body


the
astral
body
exists
in
a
nonphysical
dimension
called
the
astral
plane


here
the
soul
continues
to
have
experiences
until
it
is
born
again
in
another
physical
body
as

baby


after
many
lifetimes
of
following
dharma
right
way
of
living
the
soul
is
fully
matured

and
knowledge
of
god


there
is
no

need
for
physical
birth
for
all
lessons

found
that
the
best
research
evidence
supporting
the
belief
in

comes
from
the
cases
of

children
who
typically
between

ages
of

make
statements
about
a
previous
life

claim
to

had
before
being
born


some
per
cent
of

children
also
have
birthmarks
or
birth
defects
which
often
correspond
to
injuries

by
