history
after
the
last
ice
age
devon
was
one
of
the
first
places
in
england
where
people
started
to
live


archaeologists
have
found
many
old
places
in
devon
with
ancient
buildings


for
example
many
ruins
of
old
buildings
have
been
found
in
an
area
called
which
is
now
a
national
park


devon
gets
its
name
from
the
a
name
that
the
invading
romans
gave
to
the
celtic
tribe
in
that
area


the
romans
invaded
devon
about
ad


the

means
a

in
the

and
the
king
of

have
attacked

there
was
a
conflict
between

and

some
historians
think
that

by
about
but
others
think
this
did
not
happen
until
at
least


eventually
took
control
but
the
kings
of
devon
still
had
some
power


a
person

william
of

that
in
both

and
saxons
were
equal
in
but
that
king
of
then
chased
the
britons
from


from
place
names
and
church
dedications
it
seems
that
the
british
did
not
go
far

the
people
who
were
injured
in
the
explosion
in
hospital
however
the
driver
took
a
wrong
turn
and
stopped
outside
the
cafe
where
was
eating


saw
this
and
went
outside


he
took
out
a
gun
and
shot
at
two
bullets
hit
the
archduke
one
hit
his
wife
and
the
other
hit
the
car


both
and
his
wife
died
shortly
after


blamed
serbia
for
the
assassination


then
declared
war
on
serbia
and
russia
joined
the
war
on
serbia
side
because
the
people
of
serbia
were
slavic
like
russia
and
the
slavic
countries
had
agreed
to
help
each
other
if
they
were
attacked


since
russia
is
a
large
country
it
had
to
move
soldiers
closer
to
the
war
but
germany
feared
that
russia
soldiers
would
also
attack
germany


russia
did
not
like
germany
because
of
things
germany
had
done
in
the
past
to
become
stronger


germany
declared
war
on
russia
and
used
a
plan
to
attack
russia
that
had
been
created
before
the
war
but
it
also
involved
attacking
france
and
belgium


france
and
great
britain
joined
the
war
because
great
britain
had
agreed
to
help
belgium
if
it
were
ever
attacked
by
someone
else


this
quickly
led
to
a
war


declared
war
on
serbia


both
country
allies
became
involved
in
the
war
and
soon
most
of
europe
