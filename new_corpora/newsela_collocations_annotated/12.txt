in

brazilians
started

during

made

before
people
studied
substances
to
figure
out
how
to
do
things
such
as
turn
lead
into
gold
but
no
one
managed
to
do
that


this
was
called
alchemy


alchemists
people
that
did
alchemy
did
discover
some
useful
things
though


sulphuric
acid
and
<collocation>nitric acid</collocation>
were
two
substances
that
they
discovered


only
a
few
elements
were
known


some
of
them
are
mercury
silver
gold
and
carbon


chemistry
began
as
a
true
science
during
the


this
is
when
chemists
discovered
the
simplest
substances
that
make
up
all
other
substances


these
simple
substances
are
called
elements


one
of
the
things
that
they
learned
is
that
gold
and
lead
are
two
different
elements
so
you
can
not
change
one
into
the
other
by
a
chemical
reaction


the
first
element
discovered
after
was
phosphorus
a
strange
white
glowing
solid


elements
were
discovered
more
and
more
rapidly


people
separated
the
air
into
many
parts
and
isolated
the
<collocation>noble gases</collocation>
from
it


they
also
processed
special
minerals
from
a
mine
in
sweden
to
get
rare
earth
metals


radioactivity
was
also
discovered


today
chemists
have
discovered
different
elements


some
are
very
common
like
oxygen


many
are
very
rare
and
expensive
like
platinum


some
can
not
be
found
on
earth
and
can
only
be
made
in
labs
like


since
the
the
increased
understanding
of
physics
has
changed
chemists
theories
about
chemical
reactions


with
smaller
and
faster
computers
chemists
have
built
better
tools
for
analyzing
substances


these
tools
have
been
sent
to
study
chemicals
on
mars


police
also
use
those
tools
to
study
evidence
from
crime
scenes


types
of
chemistry
there
are
several
types
of
chemistry


<collocation>analytical chemistry</collocation>
looks
at
which
chemicals
are
in
things


for
example
looking
at
how
much
arsenic
is
in
food


<collocation>organic chemistry</collocation>
looks
at
things
that
have
carbon
in
them


for
example
making
acetylene


<collocation>inorganic chemistry</collocation>
looks
at
things
that
do
not
have
carbon
in
them


one
example
is
making
an
<collocation>integrated circuit</collocation>


a
large
area
of
chemistry
is
polymer
chemistry


this
looks
at
plastics


one
example
is
making
nylon


because
plastics
are
made
of
carbon
polymer
chemistry
is
part
of
<collocation>organic chemistry</collocation>


another
area
is
biochemistry


this
looks
at
the
chemistry
of
living
things


an
example
would
be
seeing
how
arsenic
poisons
people


biochemistry
is
also
part
of
<collocation>organic chemistry</collocation>


there
are
many
other
small
branches
of
chemistry


concepts
of
chemistry
basic
concepts
the
basic
unit
of
an
element
is
called
an
atom


an
atom
is
the
smallest
building
block
that
you
can
cut
an
element
into
without
the
element
breaking
down
turning
into
a
lighter
element
for
example
through
<collocation>nuclear fission</collocation>
or
<collocation>radioactive decay</collocation>


a
chemical
compound
is
a
substance
made
up
of
two
or
more
elements


in
a
compound
two
or
more
atoms
are
joined
together
to
form
a
molecule


the
tiniest
speck
of
dust
or
drop
of
liquid
that
one
can
see
is
made
up
of
many
millions
or
billions
of
these
molecules


mixtures
are
substances
where
chemicals
are
mixed
but
not
reacted


an
example
would
be
mixing
sand
and
salt


this
can
be
undone
again
to
produce
salt
and
sand
separately


chemical
compounds
are
changed
by
a
chemical
reaction


an
example
would
be
heating
<collocation>sodium bicarbonate</collocation>
common
baking
soda


it
will
make
water
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
and
<collocation>sodium carbonate</collocation>
