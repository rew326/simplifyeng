a
penalty
and
the

has
to
sit
in
a
penalty
box


while
the
player
sits
in
the
penalty
box
his
team
has
to
play
without
him
and
will
have
fewer
players
on
the

and
at
world
championships


ice
hockey
began
in
canada
in
the
century


there
are
two
types
of
penalty
the
major
and
the
minor


the
minor
is
the
main
one
the
referee
will
call
during
a
game
and
the
players
have
to
go
in
the
penalty
box
for
two
minutes


the
major
is
when
players
fight
with
each
other
or
when
someone
did
something
very
dangerous


most
of
time
players
are
kicked
out
of
the
games
but
in
a
fight
they
only
get
minutes
in
the
penalty
box


in
the
national
hockey
league
there
are
four
referees


two
lineman
and
two
head
referee


only
head
referees
can
call
the
penalty


they
can
be
recognized
by
the
orange
armband
on
their
arm


in
the
major
league
the
game
is
separated
into
three
periods
of
minutes


for
the
minor
league
the
time
can
be
different
for
each
category


each
period
starts
after
the


a
is
when
two
teams
are
in
position
around
the
circle


then
the
referee
drops
the
puck
between
the
players
who
play
center


there
are
different
positions
center
right
wing
left
wing
right
defense
left
defense
and
goalie


the
play
is
over
after
a
whistle
of
any
referee


after
a
the
time
stops
running


each
team
can
have
a
maximum
of
players
including
two
who
have
a
zone
to
defend


each
team
has
one
captain
and
two
or
three
assistant
captains


the
ice
is
separated
into
three
zones


each
zone
is
marked
by
lines


the
center
zone
is
between
two
blue
lines
and
team
zones
are
between
one
blue
line
and
the
end
of
the
ice


the
lineman
can
whistle
for
two
reasons
icing
and
offside


an
icing
is
when
a
player
throws
the
puck
into
the
zone
before
he
crosses
the
red
line
center
line
and
an
offside

<collocation>magnesium magnesium</collocation>
is
a
<collocation>chemical element</collocation>
with
the
symbol
mg
atomic
number
and
common
oxidation
state


it
is
an
<collocation>alkaline earth</collocation>
metal
and
the
eighth
most
<collocation>abundant element</collocation>
in
the
earth
crust
where
it
constitutes
about
by
mass
and
ninth
in
the
known
universe
as
a
whole


this
preponderance
of
magnesium
is
related
to
the
fact
that
it
is
easily
built
up
in
supernova
stars
from
a
<collocation>sequential addition</collocation>
of
three
<collocation>helium nuclei</collocation>
to
carbon
which
in
turn
is
made
from
three
<collocation>helium nuclei</collocation>


magnesium
ion
high
in
water
helps
ensure
that
it
is
the
third
most
<collocation>abundant element</collocation>
dissolved
in
seawater


magnesium
is
the
most
<collocation>abundant element</collocation>
by
mass
in
the
human
body


its
ions
are
essential
to
all
living
cells


the
ions
play
a
major
role
in
manipulating
important
biological
compounds
like
and


hundreds
of
enzymes
thus
require
magnesium
ions
to
function


magnesium
is
also
the
metallic
ion
at
the
center
of
chlorophyll
and
is
thus
a
common
additive
to
fertilizers


magnesium
ions
are
sour
to
the
taste
and
in
<collocation>low concentrations</collocation>
help
to
impart
a
natural
to
fresh
mineral
waters


the
free
element
metal
is
not
found
naturally
on
earth
as
it
is
highly
reactive
though
once
produced
is
coated
in
a
thin
layer
of
oxide
see
which
partly
masks
this


the
free
metal
burns
with
a
<collocation>characteristic brilliant</collocation>
white
light
making
it
a
useful
ingredient
in
flares


the
metal
is
now
mainly
obtained
by
electrolysis
of
<collocation>magnesium salts</collocation>
obtained
from
brine


uses
commercially
the
chief
use
for
the
metal
is
as
an
agent
to
make
aluminium
<collocation>magnesium alloys</collocation>
sometimes
called
or


since
magnesium
is
less
dense
than
aluminium
these
alloys
are
prized
for
their
relative
lightness
and
strength


magnesium
is
used
in
fireworks
to
make
a
brilliant
white
light


another
use
is
to
mix
it
with
other
metals
to
make
it
strong
lightweight
alloys
such
as
those
used
to
make
<collocation>bicycle frames</collocation>


magnesium
compounds
are
used
as
common
laxatives
antacids
milk
of
magnesia
and
in
a
number
of
situations
where
stabilization
of
abnormal
nerve
excitation
and
blood
vessel
spasm
is
required
that
is
to
treat


magnesium
is
used
in
electronic
devices
including
<collocation>mobile phones</collocation>
<collocation>laptop computers</collocation>
cameras
and
other
<collocation>electronic components</collocation>


magnesium
low
weight
good
mechanical
and
electrical
properties
are
good
for
these
uses


magnesium
reacted
with
an
gives
a
reagent
which
is
a
very
useful
tool
for
preparing


magnesium
is
also
used
in
<collocation>incendiary bombs</collocation>
which
are
bombs
that
blow
up
and
spread
fire
everywhere
