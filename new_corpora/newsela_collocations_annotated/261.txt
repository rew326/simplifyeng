of
the
english


he
sent
his
archers
halfway
up
the
slope
to
attack
the
english


he
sent
his
mounted
knights
to
the
left
and
right
to
find
any
weak
spots


at
first
william
knights
tried
to
break
through
the
<collocation>shield wall</collocation>
with
the
weight
of
their
horses


but
they
were
attacking
uphill
and
could
not
gain
any
speed


harold
front
line
simply
stood
fast
and
was
able
to
fend
off
any
attacks


william
army
began
to
fall
back
with
rumors
of
duke
william
death


william
removed
his
helmet
so
his
men
could
see
he
was
still
alive


when
william
saw
that
many
of
harold
men
were
following
his
knights
back
down
the
hill
he
used
a
trick
he
had
learned
years
before


he
turned
suddenly
and
charged
the
oncoming
english
foot
soldiers
who
had
no
chance
against
mounted
knights


this
tactic
worked
at
least
two
more
times
during
the
battle
and
made
harold
<collocation>shield wall</collocation>
weaker


now
william
used
something
new


where
his
attacks
by
knights
and
soldiers
had
been
separate
movements
he
now
used
them
together


where
his
archers
had
not
succeeded
against
the
<collocation>shield wall</collocation>
he
had
them
shoot
high
into
the
air
so
the
arrows
came
down
on
top
of
the
english


this
may
be
where
king
harold
was
killed
by
an
arrow
through
his
eye


the
<collocation>shield wall</collocation>
finally
broke
and
the
normans
were
on
top
of
them


by
nightfall
the
english
were
either
dead
on
the
field
or
being
hunted
down
by
william
men


william
called
his
men
back
and
they
spent
the
night
camped
on
the
battlefield


aftermath
the
battle
was
won
but
the
english
still
had
smaller
armies
which
had
not
joined
king
harold
at
hastings


they
had
lost
their
king
but
were
still
trying
to
reorganize


william
rested
his
army
for
five
days
before
moving
towards
london


his
line
of
march
took
him
through
several
towns
he
either
captured
or
destroyed


when
william
reached
london
the
english
resisted
for
a
short
time
but
in
the
end
surrendered


on
christmas
day
in
william
was
crowned
king
of
england


his
victory
at
hastings
gave
duke
william
the
nickname
he
has
been
known
by
ever
since
william
the
conqueror


king
of
england
early
reign
william
chose
to
be
crowned
at
christmas


this
was
partly
because
he
thought
the
english
would
be
less
likely
to
riot
at
this
high
feast
day


it
was
also
a
good
choice
because
he
believed
it
was
god
will
he
be
king


throughout
his
reign
he
maintained
he
was
the
<collocation>rightful successor</collocation>
to
king
edward


that
his
reign
followed
that
of
edward
only
after
a
brief
period
of
england
not
having
a
king
called
an


harold
was
a
usurper
and
never
had
the
right
to
rule
england


in
all
official
records
the
reign
of
king
edward
was
followed
by
that
of
king
william


william
was
crowned
in
the
english
tradition
and
was
to
rule
as
an
english
king


now
the
king
william
spent
a
few
months
in
england


he
then
returned
to
normandy
leaving
england
in
the
hands
of
two
capable
men


these
were
his
the
bishop
of
and
william


was
made
the
earl
of
kent
while
became
the
earl
of
hereford


the
remaining
three
english
earls
were
left
in
place


when
william
sailed
back
to
normandy
with
him
were
many
of
his
followers


many
of
his
soldiers
who
had
been
paid
and
others
he
wished
to
keep
track
of


in
particular
these
were
the
english
archbishop
and
edgar


he
also
brought
his
remaining
three
english
earls
and


this
was
so
none
of
them
could
start
a
revolt
while
he
was
away


william
had
his
duties
at
home
to
take
care
of


also
many
of
his
soldiers
needed
to
come
back
to
keep
the
duchy
safe


when
william
returned
to
london
in
december
of
he
began
to
find
out
what
problems
had
come
up
while
he
was
gone


hertfordshire
had
been
raided
by


then
had
not
accepted
the
rule
of
the
new
king


william
raised
money
from
all
those
parts
of
england
that
would
pay


he
also
called
out
english


surrendered
after
one
of
its
hostages
was
blinded


after
he
subdued
devon
and
cornwall
all
seemed
quiet


at
winchester
william
sent
for
his
wife
matilda
who
was
crowned
queen
of
england
there
at
pentecost


by
summer
more
rebellions
had
broken
out


at
the
same
time
others
were
fleeing
england


edgar
along
with
his
mother
and
sisters
left
for
scotland
where
they
were
welcomed


in
the
north
strong
norman
groups
were
gathering
around
york


earl
and
his
brother
left
william
court
to
join
the
rebels
in
the
north


william
then
built
a
castle
at


this
caused
the
earls
and
others
to
give
in
to
william


other
castles
followed


william
then
entered
york
where
others
came
to
him
and
submitted


he
then
negotiated
with
the
king
of
scots
to
prevent
any
invasions
of
england
from
the
north


but
his
campaign
in
the
north
was
not
as
effective
as
he
thought


in
a
second
uprising
developed
into
a
war


the
men
william
left
in
charge
had
been
killed


a
small
norman
force
was
holding
out
in
york
when
william
came
to
their
aid


after
building
another
castle
william
left
earl
william
in
charge


for
the
next
five
months
the
north
was
quiet


but
the
northern
english
leaders
had
sent
word
to
king
in
denmark
offering
him
the
crown
if
he
could
defeat
the
normans


sent
a
danish
fleet
to
england


in
the
summer
of
the
danish
fleet
appeared
off
the
coast
of
kent


it
moved
up
the
coast
towards
the
north
raiding
as
it
went


william
and
his
army
were
in
the
south
guarding
against
any
incursions


finally
the
fleet
joined
the
english
rebels
on
the
banks
of
the
river


the
remaining
english
earls
all
deserted
william
and
joined
the
combined
forces


they
moved
against
the
norman
garrison
at
york
and
killed
all
but
a
few
women
and
children


william
a
norman
who
had
lived
in
england
before
was
also
spared


harrying
of
the
north
william
northern
army
was
wiped
out
and
york
in
was
in
ruins


at
the
same
time
smaller
rebellions
were
breaking
out
in
wales
and
southwest
england


william
knew
he
was
in
trouble


he
began
by
calling
in
all
his
commanders
and
troops
to
combine
his
forces


the
king
knew
that
with
a
smaller
army
he
had
to
deal
with
one
group
of
rebels
at
a
time


he
sent
william
and
brian
of
to
deal
with


william
himself
fought
an
army
moving
in
from
the
east


in
both
cases
the
norman
armies
were
victorious


he
now
moved
on
the
northern
armies
that
had
destroyed
york


but
he
was
unable
to
get
any
farther
north
than


after
trying
for
several
weeks
william
bribed
the
danish
fleet
to
withdraw
from
york
for
the
winter


they
agreed
and
returned
to
the
mouth
of
the
to
winter
there


william
was
now
able
to
move
up
to
york


he
rebuilt
the
castles
there


he
then
had
his
forces
spread
out
and
destroy
everything
useful
for
the
english
and
danish
army
to
feed
itself


the
result
was
<collocation>widespread famine</collocation>
and
the
people
of
the
area
either
left
or
starved
to
death


this
was
william
infamous
harrying
of
the
north


out
of
about
villages
in
yorkshire
about
half
were
destroyed


of
those
that
were
left
they
lost
animals
and
large
numbers
of
men


the
entire
area
was
slow
to
recover
from
this
punishment


the
result
of
all
this
was
the
surrender
of
his
english
earls
and
most
of
the
rebels
in
england


the
few
remaining
groups
were
quickly
crushed
by
william
army


but
one
group
proved
more
stubborn


this
was
at
chester
and
after
a
forced
march
during
winter
william
surprised
them
before
they
were
ready


after
their
surrender
he
built
two
more
castles
there
then
returned
to
winchester


ruling
england
and
normandy
william
never
again
had
to
lay
waste
to
a
county
as
he
did
at
yorkshire


he
had
dealt
with
the
main
threats
to
his
rule
but
some
had
only
been
solved
in
part


the
danish
fleet
came
back
in
this
time
led
by
king


they
joined
a
small
group
of
rebels
on
the
isle
of
led
by
the
wake


again
william
bribed
the
danes
to
leave
and
then
dealt
with
the
rebels


was
never
heard
from
again


william
now
had
to
rule
both
england
and
normandy


he
found
he
had
to
be
present
to
keep
things
under
control


when
he
was
in
normandy
trouble
often
broke
out
in
england


when
in
england
though
normandy
was
being
ruled
by
his
wife
matilda


but
the
new
count
of
had
taken
maine
from
william
control


william
had
to
take
it
back
in


in
william
arrested
his
bishop
of
and
earl
of
kent


the
reasons
are
uncertain
but
was
trying
to
raise
an
army
to
march
on
rome


his
plan
was
to
become
the
next
pope


william
put
him
on
trial
on
the
isle
of
wight


in
addition
to
other
crimes
was
that
of
trying
to
raise
an
army
among
william
soldiers


as
william
pointed
out
they
were
needed
for
the
defense
of
england


protested
that
not
even
a
king
could
judge
him


as
a
bishop
only
the
pope
could


william
replied
that
he
was
seizing
a
bishop
he
was
seizing
his
earl
who
he
left
in
charge
during
his
absence


was
imprisoned
in
normandy
for
the
rest
of
his
life


in
queen
matilda
died
and
was
buried
in


the
two
had
been
very
close
and
only
disagreed
over
their
son
robert


robert
had
repeatedly
rebelled
against
his
father
yet
kept
in
contact
with
his
mother


this
caused
a
rift
between
them


philip
i
of
france
had
found
it
difficult
for
his
vassal
to
become
a
king
like
himself
and
so
resented
william


not
strong
enough
to
fight
william
himself
when
robert
rebelled
against
his
father
king
philip
helped
him


in
the
summer
of
william
learned
that
king
iv
of
denmark
was
getting
a
fleet
ready
to
sail
against
england


william
came
back
to
england
in
the
fall
with
a
large
number
of
soldiers


he
had
to
pay
them
and
feed
them
at
great
cost


it
may
have
been
at
this
time
he
realized
he
had
no
records
of
what
was
owed
him
as
king


he
did
know
if
he
was
collecting
all
the
taxes
that
were
due


book
center
writing
the
book


at
his
christmas
court
at
gloucester
in
william
asked
that
a
great
survey
be
taken
in
every
part
of
england


the
king
wanted
to
know
how
many
people
lived
in
his
realm


he
wanted
to
know
the
size
of
every
property
what
each
was
worth
and
how
much
income
it
brought
in


no
such
survey
had
ever
been
made
in
england
before


it
was
unique
in
what
it
covered
its
details
and
its
contribution
to
english
history


the
book
was
the
first
public
record
in
england


the
text
of
the
book
fit
into
two
volumes


the
first
covered
counties


it
was
called
great
because
of
its
size


the
second
covered
the
counties
of
norfolk
and
suffolk
and
was
called
little


the
facts
were
recorded
by
several
panels
made
up
of
bishops
and
earls


each
panel
collected
information
on
several
counties


william
was
presented
with
a
large
collection
of
written
records
on
august


this
was
the
book
but
it
would
bound
into
books
for
almost
another
century

william

it

william
