archaeology
is
the
study
of
the
past
by
looking
for
the
remains
and
artifacts
historical
things
left
by
the
people
who
lived
<collocation>long ago</collocation>


these
remains
can
include
old
coins
tools
buildings
and
garbage


archaeologists
the
people
who
study
archaeology
use
these
remains
to
understand
how
people
lived


archaeologists
think
it
is
important
to
understand
the
past
because
so
many
people
use
the
past
to
know
where
they
come
from

fieldwork
when
archaeologists
do
fieldwork
they
look
for
remains
often
by
digging
deep
in
the
ground


when
things
are
found
or
even
when
nothing
is
found
the
results
of
the
fieldwork
are
taken
back
to
the
place
where
the
archaeologist
base
is
maybe
a
university
or
museum


they
record
everything
they
found
by
writing
down
on
paper
or
entering
the
information
into
a
computer
so
that
they
can
build
a
picture
of
everything
that
is
found


as
settlements
places
where
people
lived
in
groups
change
and
grow
old
buildings
are
often
buried
to
make
space
for
new
buildings


ancient
rome
for
example
is
now
up
to
feet
metres
below
the
present
city


this
is
why
archaeological
fieldwork
is
expensive
and
why
it
takes
a
long
time


fields
of
interest
archaeologists
do
not
all
study
the
same
civilizations
they
specialize
in
different
areas
of
interest


some
fields
of
interest
include
ancient
egypt
these
specialists
are
called
ancient
greece
or
the
vikings


archaeologists
study
every
civilization
that
is
known
especially
the
ones
where
there
is
no
written
history


they
can
study
any
time
period


for
example
one
might
study
the
beginning
of
human
life
in
africa
or
one
might
study
<collocation>world war</collocation>

some
archaeologists
study
things
that
are
now
underwater


they
search
for
<collocation>sunken ships</collocation>
or
cities
that
have
been
lost
under
the
sea


sites
stonehenge
in
england
is
a
famous
archaeological
site
or
place


other
famous
sites
include
wat
and
great
zimbabwe


in
many
countries
governments
and
other
groups
of
people
protect
important
sites
so
that
they
will
not
be
destroyed
and
so
that
visitors
can
always
come
and
see
them


sometimes
<collocation>archaeological sites</collocation>
are
found
when
foundations
are
dug
for
new
buildings


archaeologists
have
to
work
quickly
when
this
happens
because
people
building
often
do
have
a
lot
of
time


many
times
as
soon
as
the
archaeologists
are
done
with
their
work
the
remains
that
they
have
found
will
be
covered
over
unless
they
are
very
important
