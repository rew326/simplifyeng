also
islamic
forces
had
taken
over
parts
of
spain
where
they
built
cities
and
mosques
with
pointed
arches


<collocation>architectural historians</collocation>
think
that
the
<collocation>pointed arch</collocation>
was
also
used
by
some
european
architects
because
it
was
a
very
strong
way
of
making
an
arch


in
gothic
architecture
the
<collocation>pointed arch</collocation>
is
used
in
every
place
where
an
arch
is
needed
both
for
strength
and
for
decoration


gothic
openings
such
as
doorways
windows
arcades
and
galleries
have
pointed
arches


a
row
of
arches
is
called
an
arcade


a
row
of
arches
that
is
up
high
on
a
building
is
a
gallery


rows
of
pointed
arches
were
used
to
decorate
walls


this
is
known
as
blind


often
walls
were
made
with
tall
<collocation>narrow arched</collocation>
openings
in
them
that
could
be
used
to
stand
statues
in


an
opening
like
this
is
called
a
niche
which
is
pronounced


vaulted
roofs
with
pointed
arches
an
<collocation>arched roof</collocation>
built
of
bricks
or
stone
is
called
a
vault


in
the
romanesque
period
before
the
gothic
some
churches
had
vaulted
roofs


they
were
always
based
on
perfectly
shapes


there
were
two
main
ways
to
make
a
<collocation>nave vault</collocation>
in
the
romanesque
period


a
vault
could
be
long
like
a
tunnel


churches
with
this
type
of
vault
were
always
rather
dark


or
it
could
be
square
like
two
tunnels
crossing
each
other


this
meant
that
the
columns
that
carried
the
vault
always
had
to
be
placed
on
a
perfectly
square
ground
plan
which
was
not
always
possible


one
of
the
good
things
about
pointed
arches
was
that
they
could
be
narrow
and
tall
or
flattened
and
wide


using
pointed
arches
architects
could
make
vaults
of
very
different
shapes


they
did
not
even
have
to
be
rectangular


a
gothic
architect
could
make
a
vault
with
one
side
narrow
two
sides
wide
and
the
last
side
even
wider


they
could
make
a
vault
with
three
sides
or
five
sides
quite
easily
by
using
pointed
arches


the
vaults
were
made
of
ribs
which
met
each
other
at
the
highest
part
of
the
vault


in
between
the
ribs
were
sloping
surfaces
of
stone
or
brick
that
could
be
<collocation>much thinner</collocation>
and
lighter
than
the
ribs


at
first
the
pattern
made
by
the
ribs
was
quite
plain
like
<collocation>romanesque vaults</collocation>
but
architects
particularly
in
england
soon
started
adding
small
ribs
in
between
the
main
ones
and
making
different
patterns


some
vaults
like
this
can
also
be
seen
in
spain
and
germany
but
not
usually
in
france
or
italy

the
vault
at
cathedral

it
is
the
longest
gothic
vault
in
the
world


this
vault
in
spain
has
many
small
<collocation>curved ribs</collocation>
in
between
the
supporting
ones
to
make
a

different
shapes
of
gothic
arches
in
the
gothic
period
the
shape
and
style
of
pointed
arches
changed


but
the
changes
were
not
the
same
in
every
country


with
pointed
arches
windows
could
be
made
very
large


architects
made
many
designs
of
pointed
arches
crossing
each
other
in
different
ways


these
designs
were
often
used
in
windows
which
look
as
if
they
are
filled
with
beautiful
<collocation>stone lace</collocation>


this
is
called
tracery


the
stone
tracery
was
used
to
hold
the
glass
in
place


an
architectural
historian
can
often
tell
just
how
old
a
part
of
a
building
is
by
looking
at
the
<collocation>window tracery</collocation>
design


lancet
arch
the
simplest
gothic
arch
is
a
long
opening
with
a
<collocation>pointed arch</collocation>
known
in
england
as
the
lancet


a
lancet
is
a
sharp
knife
so
these
windows
are


very
often
<collocation>lancet windows</collocation>
are
put
together
in
a
group
of
three
or
five


<collocation>salisbury cathedral</collocation>
is
famous
for
the
beauty
of
its
lancet
gothic
architecture


in
england
the
style
is
called
early
english
gothic


york
cathedral
in
england
has
a
group
of
five
<collocation>lancet windows</collocation>
that
are
feet
high
and
are
still
full
of
ancient
glass


they
are
called
the
five
sisters


these
simple
windows
are
also
found
at
cathedral
and
cathedral
in
france


they
are
the
most
usual
sort
of
gothic
windows
in
italy


equilateral
arch
many
gothic
openings
have
tops
that
are
based
upon
an
equilateral
triangle


the
equilateral
arch
has
a
very
pleasing
look
and
gives
a
wide
opening
useful
for
doorways
arcades
and
big
windows


these
arches
are
often
filled
with
tracery
in
circular
designs


in
england
this
style
is
called
geometric
decorated
gothic


it
can
be
seen
at
many
english
and
french
cathedrals
for
example
lincoln
cathedral
in
england
and
notre
dame
in
paris


flamboyant
arch
some
gothic
windows
have
designs
in
the
tracery
or
even
in
the
top
of
the
window
itself
that
rises
up
like
a
flame


this
is
called
flamboyant
gothic


tracery
like
this
makes
a
very
rich
and
lively
effect


some
of
the
most
beautiful
and
famous
windows
of
europe
have
this
type
of
tracery


it
can
be
seen
at
st
stephen
vienna
sainte
in
paris
at
the
cathedrals
of
and
rouen
in
france
and
at
milan
cathedral
in
italy


in
england
the
most
famous
windows
like
this
are
the
west
window
of
york
minster
with
its
design
based
on
the
<collocation>sacred heart</collocation>
the
east
window
at
cathedral
and
the
east
window
of
abbey


<collocation>architectural historians</collocation>
sometimes
argue
about
which
of
these
is
the
most
beautiful


arches
are
not
as
strong
as
ordinary
pointed
arches


it
is
never
used
for
making
a
vaulted
roof


if
this
shape
is
used
to
make
a
doorway
there
is
generally
another
stronger
arch
around
it


another
way
is
to
make
a
square
topped
door
that
has
<collocation>flamboyant decoration</collocation>
over
the
top


in
france
there
are
many
doorways
both
in
churches
and
in
houses
that
are
like
this


they
are
rare
in
england
but
there
is
one
at
rochester
cathedral


in
england
the
flamboyant
style
was
used
wall
and


the
most
famous
examples
in
are
in
the
lady
chapel
at
the
screen
at
lincoln
and
the
facade
of
cathedral


in
german
and
spanish
gothic
architecture
the
flamboyant
style
is
often
used
for
stone
screens


the
famous
pulpit
in
vienna
cathedral
is
made
like
this


depressed
arch
the
depressed
arch
is
wide
and
looks
as
if
it
has
been
pushed
almost
flat


when
arches
like
this
are
used
to
make
great
big
windows
they
need
to
be
supported
by
many
tall
thin
vertical
shafts
and
horizontal
so
that
the
window
looks
as
if
it
has
been
divided
up
into
a
grid
lots
of
rectangles


this
sort
of
decoration
is
used
on
walls
as
well


in
england
the
style
is
called
<collocation>perpendicular gothic</collocation>
style


at
gloucester
cathedral
the
perpendicular
east
window
is
said
to
be
as
large
as
a
tennis
court


there
are
three
very
famous
large
chapels
in
this
style
king
college
chapel
cambridge
george
chapel
at
<collocation>windsor castle</collocation>
henry
chapel
at
<collocation>westminster abbey</collocation>


the
other
famous
example
is
bath
abbey


the
south
<collocation>transept facade</collocation>
at
york
minster
has
lancet
windows


the
windows
in
the
chapter
house
at
york
minster
have
equilateral
arches
filled
with
geometric
tracery

decoration
a
gothic
cathedral
was
designed
to
be
like
a
model
of
the
universe


everything
about
the
building
was
designed
to
tell
a
message
about
god


the
statues
the
decoration
stained
glass
windows
and
wall
paintings
told
bible
stories
such
as
how
god
created
the
world
and
how
he
rules
over
everything
that
is
in
the
universe
the
seasons
of
the
year
and
the
stars
in
the
sky


carvings
near
the
door
often
show
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
because
the
patterns
of
stars
in
the
sky
were
very
important
to
farming
people
who
did
not
have
calendars
to
tell
them
when
to
plant
and
when
to
harvest


above
the
main
door
is
often
a
sculpture
of
jesus
on
a
throne
judging
the
people
of
the
earth


many
pictures
and
sculptures
are
there
to
remind
people
to
live
good
lives
because
they
never
know
what
will
happen
next


many
churches
were
very
richly
decorated
both
inside
and
out


the
statues
were
often
painted
in
bright
colors
but
nowadays
only
tiny
bits
remain
at
cathedral
and
some
other
places


wooden
ceilings
were
usually
brightly
colored


sometimes
the
stone
columns
were
painted
as
well


the
royal
portal
of
cathedral


our
lady
of
at
cathedral


the
devil
tempting
the
foolish
virgins
at
cathedral


the
famous
pulpit
of
vienna


regional
differences
even
though
some
things
about
gothic
architecture
stay
the
same
other
things
look
different
in
different
countries


building
materials
different
building
materials
were
found
in
different
parts
of
europe


this
is
one
of
the
differences
in
the
architecture
between
different
places


in
france
there
was
limestone


it
was
good
for
building
because
it
was
soft
to
cut
but
got
much
harder
when
the
air
and
rain
got
on
it


it
was
usually
a
pale
gray
color


france
also
had
beautiful
white
limestone
from
which
was
perfect
for
making
very
<collocation>fine carvings</collocation>


england
had
<collocation>coarse limestone</collocation>
red
sandstone
and
dark
green
marble
which
was
often
used
for
<collocation>architectural decorations</collocation>
like
thin
columns


in
northern
germany
netherlands
denmark
baltic
countries
and
northern
poland
there
was
no
good
building
stone
but
there
was
clay
for
making
bricks
and
tiles


so
many
of
these
countries
have
<collocation>brick gothic</collocation>
churches
and
even
<collocation>brick gothic</collocation>
castles


in
italy
limestone
was
used
for
city
walls
and
castles
but
brick
was
used
for
other
buildings


because
italy
had
lots
of
beautiful
marble
in
many
different
colors
many
buildings
have
fronts
or
facades
decorated
in
colored
marble


some
churches
have
very
rough
<collocation>brick facades</collocation>
because
the
marble
was
never
put
on


florence
cathedral
for
example
did
not
get
its
<collocation>marble facade</collocation>
until
the


in
some
parts
of
europe
there
were
many
tall
straight
trees
that
were
good
for
making
very
large
roofs


but
in
england
by
the
the
long
straight
trees
were
running
out


many
of
the
trees
were
used
for
building
ships


the
architects
had
to
think
of
a
new
way
to
make
a
wide
roof
from
short
pieces
of
timber


that
is
how
they
invented
the
roofs
which
are
one
of
the
beautiful
features
seen
in
many
old
english
churches


france
french
cathedrals
and
those
in
germany
and
belgium
are
often
very
high
both
inside
and
outside


the
do
not
stick
out
far


the
facades
in
france
nearly
always
have
three
doors
a
rose
window
and
two
towers


there
are
often
facades
with
doors
on
the
as
well
as
the
front


england
the
thing
that
makes
english
cathedrals
different
from
the
others
is
that
they
are
long
and
look
horizontal
like
big
<collocation>ocean liners</collocation>


english
cathedrals
nearly
all
took
hundreds
of
years
to
build
and
every
part
is
in
a
style
that
is
quite
different
to
the
next
part


only
<collocation>salisbury cathedral</collocation>
was
not
built
in
lots
of
styles


the
west
window
is
very
large
and
is
never
a
rose
window


the
west
front
may
have
two
towers
like
a
french
cathedral
or
none


there
is
nearly
always
a
tower
at
the
middle
of
the
building
which
may
have
a
big
spire


germany
and
the
holy
roman
empire
in
germany
the
towers
and
spires
are
often
enormously
large


sometimes
they
are
so
big
that
it
was
impossible
to
finish
them
until
modern
times


the
spires
are
quite
different
to
english
spires
because
they
are
made
of
lacy


there
are
also
many
or
which
have
no
windows


the
nave
and
the
aisles
are
about
the
same
height


spain
and
portugal
like
an
english
cathedral
a
spanish
or
portuguese
gothic
cathedral
is
often
built
in
many
different
styles


they
are
often
wide


spanish
cathedrals
often
have
chapels
all
around
them


the
roof
often
has
many
different
types
of
towers
and
spires


often
the
central
towers
are
polygonal


italy
italian
gothic
cathedrals
use
lots
of
color
both
outside
and
inside


on
the
outside
the
facade
is
often
decorated
with
marble


on
the
inside
the
walls
are
often
painted
plaster


the
columns
and
arches
are
often
decorated
with
bright
colored
paint


there
are
also
mosaics
with
gold
backgrounds
and
beautifully
tiled
floors
is
<collocation>geometric patterns</collocation>


the
facades
often
have
an
<collocation>open porch</collocation>
with
a
wheel
windows
above
it


there
is
often
a
dome
at
the
center
of
the
building


the
<collocation>bell tower</collocation>
is
hardly
ever
attached
to
the
building
because
italy
has
quite
a
few
earthquakes


the
windows
are
not
as
large
as
in
northern
europe
and
although
stained
glass
windows
are
often
found
the
favorite
way
of
decorating
the
churches
is
fresco

definition
the
word
cathedral
is
derived
from
the
latin
noun
seat
or
chair
and
refers
to
the
presence
of
the
bishop
or
archbishop
chair
or
throne


in
the
ancient
world
the
chair
was
the
symbol
of
a
teacher
and
thus
of
the
bishop
role
as
teacher
and
also
of
an
official
presiding
as
a
magistrate
and
thus
of
the
bishop
role
in
governing
a
diocese


the
word
cathedral
though
now
grammatically
used
as
a
noun
is
originally
the
adjective
in
the
phrase
cathedral
church
from
the
latin


the
seat
marks
the
place
set
aside
in
the
prominent
church
of
the
diocese
for
the
head
of
that
diocese
and
is
therefore
a
major
symbol
of
authority


many
cathedrals
are
very
old


cathedrals
which
are
not
the
seat
of
a
bishop
some
churches
are
called
cathedral
but
they
are
not
the
seat
of
a
bishop


this
may
be
because
the
way
the
church
is
organised
changed
over
time


this
is
the
case
for
our
lady
of
sorrows
church
in
for
example


in
language
this
church
is
called
cathedral


it
is
part
of
the
roman
catholic
diocese
of


this
diocese
was
several
times


currently
the
cathedral
of
the
diocese
is
martin
cathedral


churches
that
formerly
were
a
diocesan
seat
may
be
called
or
