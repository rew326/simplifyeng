france
occupied
spain
for
a
long
time


this
made
spain
very
weak


it
also
made
spain
lose
its
empire
in
north
and
south
america
all
of
the
parts
of
that
empire
became
their
own
countries
or
were
taken
over
by
other
countries
such
as
the
united
states
of
america


century
there
was
not
much
peace
in
spain
during
the
first
part
of
the
century


some
spaniards
tried
to
set
up
a
government
chosen
by
the
people
a
democracy
and
they
made
the
king
of
spain
leave
the
country


however
in
two
different
groups
of
spaniards
went
to
war
over
whether
the
government
should
be
a
democracy
or
take
orders
from
one
person


in
those
who
wanted
democracy
were
defeated
and
a
dictator
named
francisco
franco
took
over
the
government


franco
died
in


he
had
decided
that
spain
should
have
a
king
again
and
he
chose
juan
the
grandson
of
the
king
who
had
been
forced
to
leave
the
country
to
be
king


but
the
king
did
not
rule
as
a
dictator
instead
he
chose
to
set
up
a
democracy


also
since
franco
death
spain
appointed
to
became
spain
first
democratically
elected
<collocation>prime minister</collocation>


now
spain
is
a
modern
democratic
country
and
does
business
with
many

around
the

study

they
study
how

also
talks
about

some
religions
see
the
body
as
where
the
soul
lives


some
see
the
body
as
like
a

this
is
because
a
church
is
where
people

these
people
think
god
should
be
worshiped
inside

some
religions
think
the
body
is
made

that
connect
us

medicine
sees
the

they
study
how

think
that
the
human

is

they
see
that
some
human

are

animal
behaviors


behaviors
are
the

acts


they
know
that

sequence
differences

the
animal
that
is
alive
now
that
is
closest

is
the

of
the
is
the
same
between
humans
and
chimpanzees


however
this
applies
only
to
single
that
is
changes
in

pairs
only


the
full
picture
is
rather
different


the

published
in


it
showed
that
the

another
account
for
million
of
the
<collocation>human genome</collocation>
million
bases
that
is
of
the
genome


this
of
the
<collocation>human genome</collocation>
is
different
from
the
chimpanzee
genome
in
changes
of
single
letters
in
the
genome


another
type
of
difference
called
account
for
another
difference
between
the
sequences


in
addition
variation
in
copy
number
of
large
segments
kb
of

sequence
provides
a
further
difference
between
the

hence
the

could
be
as
low
as

hydrogen
in

in

on

hydrogen
is
usually
a
gas


hydrogen
is
also
one
of
the
parts
that
make
up
a
water
molecule


hydrogen
is
important
because
it
is
the
fuel
that
powers
the

and

stars


hydrogen
makes
up
about
of
the

hydrogen
is
normally
made
of

atoms
connected

scientists
call
these
molecules


hydrogen
will
have
a
chemical
reaction
when
mixed
with
most
other
elements


it
has
no
color
or
smell


pure
hydrogen
is
very
uncommon
in
the
earth
atmosphere


in

it
is
usually
in
water


hydrogen
is
also
in
all
living
things
as
a
part
of
the
organic
compounds
that
living
things
are
made
of


in
addition
hydrogen
atoms
can
combine
with
carbon
atoms
to
form
hydrocarbons


petroleum
and
other
<collocation>fossil fuels</collocation>
are
made
of
these
hydrocarbons
and
commonly
used
to
create
energy
for
human
use


hydrogen
has
two
different
isotopes
called
deuterium
and
tritium


like
regular
hydrogen
they
both
have
only
one
proton
and
one
electron
but
deuterium
also
has
one
neutron
and
tritium
has
two

some
other
facts
about
hydrogen
it
is
a
gas
at
room
temperature
it
acts
like
a
metal
when
it
is
solid


it
is
the
lightest
element
in

it
is
the
most
common

element
in

history
of
hydrogen
the
name
hydrogen
comes
from
the
greek
word
for
water
pronounced


hydrogen
was
discovered
in
by
robert
even
though
many
people
think
it
was
discovered
by
henry
cavendish
in


uses
of
hydrogen
hydrogen
as
fuel
fusion
nuclear
fusion
is
a
very
powerful
source
of
energy


it
relies
on
forcing
atoms
together
to
make
helium
and
energy
exactly
as
happens
in
a
star
like
the
sun
or
in
a
hydrogen
bomb


this
needs
a
large
amount
of
energy
to
get
started
and
is
not
easy
to
do
yet


a
big
advantage
over
<collocation>nuclear fission</collocation>
which
is
used
in
nuclear
power
stations
is
that
no
waste
is
produced
and
no
toxic
fuel
like
uranium
is
needed


there
is
more
than
million
tons
of
hydrogen
undergoing
fusion
every
second
on
the
sun


water
can
be
easily
broken
down
into
hydrogen
and
oxygen
with
electricity
but
it
takes
a
lot
of
electricity
to
get
a
usable
amount
of
hydrogen


burning
hydrogen
combines
with
oxygen
molecules
to
make
steam
pure
water


a
fuel
cell
combines
hydrogen
with
an
oxygen
molecule
releasing
an
electron
as
electricity


hydrogen
power
grid
for
these
reasons
many
people
believe
hydrogen
power
will
eventually
replace
technologies
such
as
engines
and
fuel


but
it
is
not
correct
to
see
hydrogen
as
a
fuel
if
it
is
used
in
a
fuel
cell


it
is
more
of
a
replacement
for
the
power
grid


such
a
grid
and
infrastructure
with
new
vehicles
might
be
first
made
in
iceland
a
country
that
has
much
free
<collocation>geothermal energy</collocation>
and
is
quite
small


because
it
imports
all
<collocation>fossil fuel</collocation>
it
would
help
iceland
to
completely
stop
using
it


the
huge
advantage
of
hydrogen
is
that
when
burnt
in
an
engine
or
in
a
fuel
cell
there
is
no
pollution


only
a
small
amount
of
water
forms

he
is

helium
is
called
a
noble
gas
because
it
does
not
regularly

with
other
chemicals

form

it
has
the

<collocation>boiling point</collocation>
of

it
is
the
second
most
common
element
in
the
universe
after
hydrogen
and
has
no
color
or

however
helium
has
a
neon
color
when
being
burnt
with
fire


helium
does
not
usually
react
with
anything
else


astronomers
discovered
helium
in


they
found
that
it
was
in
the
sun
before
it
was
found
on
earth


because
of
where
it
was
found
its
name
comes
from
the
greek
word
for
sun
helios


helium
is
used
to
<collocation>fill balloons</collocation>
and
airships
because
it
is
lighter
than
air
and
does
not
burn
or
react
meaning
it
is
normally
safe
for
using
it
in
that
way


it
is
also
used
in
some
kinds
of
light
bulbs


people
also
breathe
it
in
to
make
their
voices
sound
higher
than
they
normally
do
as
a
joke
but
this
is
extremely
dangerous
if
they
breathe
in
too
much
since
it
can
kill
them
because
they
are
not
breathing
normal
air


breathing
too
much
helium
can
also
cause
effects
to
vocal
cords


it
can
be
created
through
the
process
of
nuclear
fusion
in
the
sun
we
are
currently
trying
to
harness
nuclear
fusion
as
a
form
of
power
but
this
is
still
at
an
early
stage
because
the
