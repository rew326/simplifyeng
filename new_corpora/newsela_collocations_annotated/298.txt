today
the
word
actor
is
for
both
men
and
women
because
some
people
think
the
name
actress
is
sexist


but
people
also
use
the
word
actress
very
often


actresses
in
men
roles
women
actors
sometimes
act
the
roles
of
young
boys
because
in
some
ways
a
woman
is
more
similar
to
a
boy
than
a
man
is


for
example
a
woman
usually
plays
the
role
of
peter
pan


in
pantomime
a
sort
of
play
for
children
not
the
same
as
mime
the
most
important
young
man
is
also
a
woman


opera
has
some
pants
roles
which
women
traditionally
sing


these
women
are
usually
which
means
they
sing
with
a
voice
that
is
high
but
not
very
high


examples
are
hansel
in
lang
de
and
in
the
marriage
of
figaro


mary
played
the
part
of
little
<collocation>lord fauntleroy</collocation>

version
of
the
book


linda
hunt
won
an
academy
award
for
best
supporting
actress
in
the
year
of
living
dangerously
in
which
she
played
the
part
of
a
man


in
comic
theater
and
film
people
often
use
a
man
for
a
woman
part
or
a
woman
for
a
man
part
this
has
a
long
history


most
of
shakespeare
comedies
have
examples
of
this


both
and
robin
williams
were
in
popular
comedy
films
where
they
played
most
scenes
as
men
in
women
clothes
pretending
to
be

voice
acting
voice
acting
is
a
special
type
of
acting


it
is
most
commonly
used
in
animation
for
both
television
and
movies


voice
actors
are
the
people
who
make
the
voices
for
the
characters


they
may
be
the
narrator
in
works


types
actors
working
in
theater
film
and
television
have
to
learn
different
skills


skills
that
work
well
in
one
type
of
acting
may
not
work
well
in
another
type
of
acting


in
theater
to
act
on
stage
actors
need
to
learn
the
stage
directions
that
appear
in
the
script
such
as
stage
left
and
stage
right


these
directions
are
based
on
the
actor
point
of
view
as
he
or
she
stands
on
the
stage
facing
the
audience


actors
also
have
to
learn
the
meaning
of
the
stage
directions
upstage
away
from
the
audience
and
downstage
towards
the
audience
theatre
actors
need
to
learn
blocking
which
is
where
and
how
an
actor
moves
on
the
stage
during
a
play


most
scripts
specify
some
blocking


the
director
will
also
give
instructions
on
blocking
such
as
crossing
the
stage
or
picking
up
and
using
a


theatre
actors
need
to
learn
stage
combat
which
is
simulated
fighting
on
stage


actors
may
have
to
simulate
fighting
or
with
sword
fighting


actors
are
coached
by
fight
directors
who
help
them
to
learn
the
choreographed
sequence
of
fight
actions


in
film
first
developed
of
acting
that
would
suit
the
cinema
rather
than
the
theater


he
realized
that
theatrical
acting
did
not
look
good
on
film


required
his
actors
and
actresses
to
go
through
weeks
of
film
acting
training


film
actors
have
to
learn
to
get
used
to
and
be
comfortable
with
a
camera
being
in
front
of
them


film
actors
need
to
learn
to
find
and
stay
on
their
mark


this
is
a
position
on
the
floor
marked
with
tape


this
position
is
where
the
lights
and
camera
focus
are


film
actors
also
need
to
learn
how
to
prepare
well
and
perform
well
on
screen
tests


screen
tests
are
a
filmed
audition
of
part
of
the
script


unlike
the
theater
actor
who
gets
to
develop
a
character
during
a
two
or
performance
the
film
actor
lacks
continuity
forcing
him
or
her
to
come
to
all
the
scenes
often
shot
in
reverse
order
in
which
they
ultimately
appear
with
a
character
already
fully
developed


since
film
captures
even
the
smallest
gesture
and
magnifies
it
<collocation>cinema demands</collocation>
a
less
flamboyant
and
stylized
bodily
performance
from
the
actor
than
does
the
theater


the
performance
of
emotion
is
the
most
difficult
aspect
of
film
acting
to
master
the
film
actor
must
rely
on
subtle
facial
ticks
quivers
and
tiny
lifts
of
the
eyebrow
to
create
a
<collocation>believable character</collocation>


some
theater
stars
have
made
the
transition
quite
successfully
close
and
for
instance
others
have
not
in
television
on
a
television
set
there
are
typically
several
<collocation>cameras angled</collocation>
at
the
set


actors
who
are
new
to
acting
can
get
confused
about
which
camera
to
look
into


tv
actors
need
to
learn
to
use
lav

was
known
for
the

he

he
also

a

his
work
changed
the
understanding
and
knowledge
of
mathematics
in
the
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>
and
mathematicians
in

read

they
began
to
use
these
hindu
arabic

instead
of
the
roman
numerals
i

the
arabic
numeral
system
is
easier
to
do
mathematics
with
as
roman
numbers
have
no
place
values


this
means
that
they
can
only
deal
with
whole

and
do
simple
equations


roman

also
have
no
number

he
wrote
a

introduced
his

also
introduced

a
medieval
ideal
portrait
of
claudius
ptolemy
is
the
english
name
for
claudius


he
was
a
greek
who
probably
lived
and
worked
in
alexandria
in
egypt


he
lived
from
about
to


he
is
famous
for
his
work
on
astronomy
and
geography


very
little
is
known
about
his
personal
life


he
was
an
astronomer
mathematician
and
geographer


he
described
in
his
writing
the
greek
or
view
of
the
universe


the
greeks
thought
that
the
earth
was
the
center
of
the
universe


he
also
thought
out
and
described
the
<collocation>apparent motions</collocation>
of
the
planets
as
they
were
known
in
his
time


ptolemy
explained
and
extended
system
of
and
<collocation>eccentric circles</collocation>
to
explain
his
theory
of
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>


ptolemy
system
involved
at
least
to
explain
the
motions
of
the
sun
the
moon
and
the
five
planets
known
in
his
time


he
believed
the
planets
and
sun
moved
around
the
earth
in
this
order
mercury
venus
sun
mars
jupiter
saturn


this
system
became
known
as
the
ptolemaic
system


it
predicts
the
positions
of
the
planets
accurately
enough
for
observations
so
it
seemed
accurate
at
the
time


this
is
described
in
his
book
mathematical
widely
called
the
a
mathematical
treatment
of
the
phenomena
of
astronomy


it
contains
a
wide
variety
of
information
ranging
from
<collocation>earth conceptions</collocation>
to
sun
moon
and
star
movement
as
well
as
eclipses
and
an
explanation
of
the
length
of
months


the
also
included
a
star
catalog
containing
constellations
using
the
names
we
still
use
today


in
addition
to
his
well
known
works
in
astronomy
<collocation>claudius ptolemy</collocation>
was
very
important
in
the
history
of
geography
and
cartography
making
maps


he
was
influential
up
to
the
century
when
his
ideas
were
disproved
by
copernicus


ptolemy
of
course
knew
that
the
earth
is
a
sphere


ptolemy
is
the
first
known
projection
of
the
sphere
onto
a
plane


his
geography
remained
the
main
work
on
the
subject
until
the
time
of
<collocation>christopher columbus</collocation>


but
he
had
asia
extending
much
too
far
east
which
may
have
been
a
factor
in
columbus
decision
to
try
to
reach
india
by
sailing
west
from
europe


the
<collocation>ptolemaic explanation</collocation>
of
the
motions
of
the
planets
remained
the
accepted
wisdom
until
the
polish
scholar
copernicus
proposed
a
view
or
view
in


it
should
be
noted
too
that
ptolemy
system
is
actually
more
accurate
than
copernicus


the
formulation
does
not
improve
on
ptolemy
until
laws
are
also
added


ptolemy
may
not
actually
have
believed
in
the
reality
of
his
system


he
may
have
thought
of
it
only
as
a
method
of
calculating
positions

the
people
of
south

were
divided
by

were
forced
to

the

the

allowed
the

to

government

had
been
very
unfair
to
alfred


the
affair
was
one
of
the
biggest
scandals
in
the
history
of

it
happened
at
the
end

century


it
was
about
alfred
a
jewish
officer
in
the
french
army


in
was
accused
of
being
a
spy
and
accused
of
crimes
against
france


people
thought
he
wrote
letters
to
the
germans
telling
them
about
secrets
of
the
french
army


his
punishment
was
to
be
sent
to
a
prison
island
in
south
america
for
the
rest
of
his
life


when
he
was
in
prison
people
mostly
his
brother
and
a
officer
called
thought
he
was
innocent


they
proved
that
another
soldier
major
was
guilty


but
the
army
did
not
want
to
admit
that
it
had
been
wrong


they
refused
to
free
him


finally
the
evidence
that
was
innocent
became
so
strong
that
the
government
had
to
demand
a
new
trial


but
at
the
new
trial
the
army
again
found
him
guilty


but
the

who
did

an
innocent
man
to
suffer
any
more
pardoned

make
calls
about
a
play
and
make
sure
everyone
follows
the
rules


on
a
baseball
field
there
are
four
bases


the
bases
form
a
square
that
goes
around
the
field
to
the

base


the

is
called
home
plate

one
point


when
one
team
bats
the
other
team
plays
defense
and

team
sports


when
the
team
on
defense
gets
three
players
out
it
is
their
turn
to
try
and
score
runs


then
the
team

starts
playing
defense
and
the
team
that

playing
defense
starts
batting


after
nine
innings
the
team
that
has
the
most
runs
is
the
winner


if
the
teams
have
the
same
number
of
runs
they
play
more
innings
until
one
team
wins


at
the
start
of
the
game
the
home
team
pitches
while
players
on
the
visiting
team
bat
