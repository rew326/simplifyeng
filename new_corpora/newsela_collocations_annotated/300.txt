background
the
republican
party
led
by
<collocation>abraham lincoln</collocation>
won
the
<collocation>presidential election</collocation>


the
republican
party
was
against
spreading
slavery
to
places
where
it
was
not
already
legal


seven
southern
states
declared
their
independence
from
the
union
after
the
election
and
formed
the
confederacy
even
before
lincoln
became
president
on
march


the
outgoing
president
james
buchanan
said
this
was
against
the
law
but
did
nothing
to
stop
them


lincoln
and
his
republican
party
thought
secession
to
be
a
rebellion


no
country
ever
recognized
the
confederacy
as
its
own
separate
nation


fighting
started
when
the
confederates
bombarded
fort
a
union
army
fort


lincoln
then
asked
the
union
states
to
raise
soldiers
to
fight
the
confederates


the
war
was
fought
mostly
in
the
southern
states


after
four
years
of
fighting
the
union
won
the
war


after
the
union
won
slavery
was
made
illegal
everywhere
in
the
united
states


fighting
begins
the
confederate
states
claimed
that
they
owned
all
forts
and
other
federal
buildings
in
the
south


fort
was
in
south
carolina
one
of
the
confederate
states


however
the
fort
was
controlled
by
the
union


on
april
confederate
forces
attacked
the
fort


they
forced
the
union
soldiers
inside
the
fort
to
surrender
give
up


after
this
president
lincoln
asked
every
union
state
for
volunteers
for
the
union
army


he
asked
these
volunteers
to
help
take
back
the
captured
forts
defend
washington
and
make
the
confederate
states
rejoin
the
union


quickly
four
more
southern
slave
states
joined
with
the
confederates
instead
of
supplying
forces
to
fight
them


a
blockade
by
the
united
states
navy
prevented
the
confederacy
from
selling
its
cotton
and
other
goods
or
buying
weapons
and
military
supplies


the
war
the
american
civil
war
was
fought
in
three
important
land
areas
or
theaters


the
eastern
theater
included
all
land
east
of
the
appalachian
mountains


the
western
theater
included
everything
between
the
appalachian
mountains
and
the
mississippi
river
and
along
the
river


the
theater
included
territory
west
of
the
mississippi
valley


both
the
united
states
and
the
confederacy
had
their
capital
cities
in
the
eastern
theater


washington
has
always
been
the
capital
of
the


when
the
south
seceded
it
named
richmond
virginia
as
the
capital
of
the
confederate
states


these
two
cities
are
only
about
miles
apart


one
of
the
first
battles
of
the
war
was
fought
in
virginia


it
was
called
the
first
battle
of
bull
run
and
happened
on
july


the
confederates
won
the
battle


the
union
army
of
the
potomac
then
tried
to
capture
richmond
in
the
peninsula
campaign
during
the
spring
of


at
this
time
robert
lee
took
command
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
and
defeated
the
union
army


he
then
won
the
second
battle
of
bull
run
in
august


lee
tried
to
win
the
war
by
invading
or
send
soldiers
into
maryland


when
he
lost
the
battle
of
he
retreated
back
to
virginia


there
was
much
fighting
at
sea
during
the
american
civil
war


lincoln
said
that
the
confederates
were
under
a
blockade
which
meant
the
union
navy
would
not
let
any
ships
into
the
south


the
confederates
used
ships
called
<collocation>blockade runners</collocation>
to
bring
things
from
europe


the
things
the
confederates
brought
included
weapons


the
navies
of
each
side
also
fought
on
the
rivers


they
used
different
kinds
of
ships
than
the
ships
used
on
the
ocean


these
kinds
included
ironclads
which
were
protected
by
iron
on
their
sides
and
which
used
cotton
along
its
sides


during
the
battle
of
roads
the
<collocation>confederate ironclad</collocation>
virginia
fought
against
the
union
ironclad
monitor


this
was
the
first
time
in
world
history
that
two
ironclads
fought
each
other


in
the
western
theater
a
lot
of
the
fighting
happened
along
the
mississippi
river


ulysses
grant
was
an
important
union
military
leader
in
the
west


the
confederates
tried
to
send
their
soldiers
into
the
state
of
kentucky
during
the
summer
of


during
the
early
months
of
the
union
army
made
the
<collocation>confederates retreat</collocation>
from
kentucky
and
from
western
tennessee


the
confederates
tried
to
recapture
western
tennessee
by
attacking
grant
army
at
the
battle
of


grant
won
the
battle


the
confederates
then
tried
to
send
their
soldiers
into
eastern
kentucky
during
the
fall
of


they
left
kentucky
after
losing
the
battle
of


the
north
won
control
of
almost
all
of
the
mississippi
river
by
capturing
the
cities
along
the
river
during
the
fall
of
and
spring
of


however
the
confederacy
still
held
an
important
city
and
fort


if
they
held
the
city
the
confederates
could
move
soldiers
and
supplies
from
one
side
of
the
river
to
the
other


grant
started
the
siege
of
during
the
month
of
may


the
siege
continued
for
a
long
time


on
the
of
july
the
confederates
in
surrendered
to
grant


this
was
one
of
the
turning
points
in
the
war
because
it
divided
the
confederacy
into
two
parts


there
were
also
battles
west
of
the
mississippi
valley
in
the
area
called
the


for
example
two
important
battles
were
the
battle
of
wilson
creek
and
the
battle
of
pea
ridge


the
confederates
tried
to
invade
new
mexico
during
february
and
march
but
they
were
defeated
at
the
battle
of
pass


after
the
union
captured
this
area
became
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
confederate
states


other
battles
happened
in
this
area
after
the
capture
of


during
the
siege
of
in
the
west
another
turning
point
came
in
the
east


after
winning
some
battles
lee
decided
to
invade
the
north
again


lee
and
his
army
of
northern
virginia
went
into
pennsylvania


the
confederate
army
met
the
union
army
near
gettysburg
pennsylvania


the
two
armies
fought
the
battle
of
gettysburg


this
battle
lasted
for
three
days
july
to


more
soldiers
died
at
gettysburg
than
in
any
other
civil
war
battle


the
union
won
the
battle


this
stopped
the
confederate
army
invasion
into
the
north


lee
and
his
troops
were
pushed
back
into
the
south


after
this
president
lincoln
decided
that
grant
was
his
best
general


he
put
grant
in
control
of
all
the
union
armies


lincoln
also
made
william
the
general
in
charge
of
the
union
troops
in
georgia


grant
led
many
attacks
on
lee
army
these
battles
were
called
the
overland
campaign


meanwhile
burned
atlanta
and
savannah


he
did
this
to
try
to
make
the
south
weaker
and
to
make
it
harder
for
southern
people
to
supply
the
confederate
army
with
food
and
other
things


then
marched
north
through
south
carolina
and
north
carolina


confederate
general
joseph
tried
to
attack
at
the
battle
of


won
the
battle


lee
held
out
as
long
as
he
could
in
virginia


eventually
he
decided
that
he
had
too
few
soldiers
to
keep
on
fighting
the
union
which
had
more
soldiers
and
supplies


lee
surrendered
to
grant
on
april
near
<collocation>appomattox court</collocation>
house


after
lee
surrendered
many
other
confederate
armies
surrendered
also


the
last
confederate
general
to
surrender
was
<collocation>brigadier general</collocation>
stand


he
surrendered
on
june
in
oklahoma


after
the
war
ended
president
lincoln
pardoned
all
of
the
confederate
soldiers


this
meant
the
confederate
soldiers
would
not
be
arrested
or
punished
for
fighting
against
the
union


they
would
be
allowed
to
rejoin
the
united
states
again


however
some
confederates
did
not
want
to
return
to
the
united
states


some
of
these
people
moved
to
or
brazil


inflation
during
the
war
inflation
happened
in
both
the
union
and
the
confederacy


this
meant
that
prices
went
up
and
everything
became
more
expensive


many
people
in
the
north
and
the
south
could
not
afford
the
higher
prices


many
went
hungry
because
of
this


this
was
one
thing
that
helped
lead
to
the
confederacy
surrender


after
the
war
many
soldiers
died
during
the
war
on
both
sides


most
of
the
war
was
fought
in
the
south


many
railroads
farms
houses
and
other
things
were
destroyed
and
most
people
there
became
very
poor


the
years
after
the
war
were
called
reconstruction


reconstruction
lasted
from
the
end
of
the
war
until


the
union
army
stayed
in
some
southern
states
during
this
time


three
important
amendments
were
added
on
to
the
united
states
constitution


the
amendments
were
proposed
or
suggested
by
the
government


although
not
every
american
supported
them
the
amendments
got
enough
support
to
pass


the
amendment
says
that
slavery
is
not
allowed
anywhere
in
the
united
states


this
officially
ended
legal
slavery
everywhere
in
the
country


during
the
war
president
lincoln
had
issued
the
emancipation
proclamation


this
said
that
all
of
the
slaves
in
the
southern
states
were
free


however
there
were
still
a
few
union
states
in
the
west
that
allowed
slavery


their
slaves
were
not
freed
by
the
emancipation
proclamation


also
because
the
confederacy
saw
itself
as
its
own
country
many
southerners
did
not
obey
the
emancipation
proclamation


so
until
the
amendment
was
passed
slavery
was
still
practiced
in
many
parts
of
the
united
states


the
amendment
makes
it
clear
that
all
people
born
in
the
united
states
are
citizens
with
<collocation>equal rights</collocation>


it
also
says
that
these
rights
can
not
be
taken
away
unless
a
person
breaks
the
law


before
this
people
were
not
seen
as
citizens


they
did
not
have
the
same
rights
as
white
people


the
amendment
gave
every
american
<collocation>equal rights</collocation>
under
the
law


the
amendment
says
that
people
in
the
united
states
can
not
be
kept
from
voting
because
of
their
race


citizens
could
be
stopped
from
voting
because
of
their
gender
however


women
could
not
vote
until
the
amendment
was
passed
in


after
the
war
some
of
the
union
army
leaders
went
into
politics


<collocation>generals grant</collocation>
hayes
garfield
harrison
and
became

and
others

recent
studies

needed
a

scientists
now
believe
he

from
a
broken
leg
made
more
complicated
by
bone
disease
and
malaria


before
this
discovery
there
were
many
theories
about
his
early
death
including
murder


it
is
believed
that
he
had
several
palaces

the
word
independence
means
not
dependent
or
not
having
to
depend
on
anyone
or
anything
else


it
also
means
being
strong
and
able
to
survive
alone


anything
can
be
dependent
or
independent


when
people
talk
about
independence
it
may
be
about
people
or
countries
where
it
is
often
being
spoken
about
as
a
good
thing


for
places
it
may
mean
sovereignty
or
autonomy

good

bad


a
country
gets
its
independence
when
it
is
no

sometimes
countries
get
their
independence
in
a
war
as
when
the
united
states
left
the
british
empire
in
the
american
war
of
independence


countries
can
also
get
their
independence
peacefully
like
canada

norway
did


help

another
country
may
be
needed
to
get
independence
like

ii
when
the
allies
freed
many
countries
that
had
been
controlled
by
the
<collocation>axis powers</collocation>
and
temporarily
vice

attempts
to
gain
independence
may
be
unsuccessful
and
may
lead
to
civil
war


singapore

independence
from

in


the
newest
country

was

other
countries
that
became
independent
not
<collocation>long ago</collocation>
are
and
in

however
some
countries
have
political
parties
that
discuss

the

was
closely

egyptian
jackals
had
an
association
with
the
dead
as
well


they
were
often
found
digging
up
buried
bodies
and
eating
them
which
may
be
why
was

jackal


the
priests
who
mummified
the
dead
kings
called
pharaohs
wore
costumes
to
make
them

jackals


the
egyptian
people
believed
that
helped
decide
the
fate
of
the
dead
in
the
afterlife


the
heart
of
the
dead
was
weighed
against
the
feather

truth
representing
the
goddess
to
see
if
the
deceased
was
worthy

life
his

heart
would
weigh
