in

the
yield
is
how
much
money
somebody
is
paid
each
year
for
leaving
his
or
her
money
invested
somewhere


unlike
a
corporate
dividend
a
yield
is
fairly
certain
unless
there
is
a
bankruptcy


this
means
that
somebody
usually
knows
how
much
money
they
are
going
to
make
from
their
yield
ahead
of
time


yields
can
be
different
because
of
inflation


however
there
is
usually
an
order
for
which
are
most
risky
and
which
are
the
least
the
least
<collocation>risky instruments</collocation>
such
as
treasury
bonds

the

instruments
like

and
so
on
to
the
various
<collocation>municipal bond</collocation>
and
<collocation>corporate bonds</collocation>


extremely
<collocation>risky instruments</collocation>

a
social
network
is
a
set
of
social
actors
people
organizations
communities
nations
and
a
set
of
social
relationships
communication
economic
transactions
interactions
kinship
trust
social
support
diffusion
contagion
shared
memberships
among
them


considering
social
relationships
as
a
network
calls
attention
in
some
manner
graphically
to
the
importance
of
the
pattern
or
structure
of
the
set
of
relationships


a
personal
social
network
is
the
pattern
of
relationships
among
a
set
of
actors
who
have
a
relationship
to
a
particular
focal
person


a
community
social
network
is
the
pattern
of
relationships
among
a
set
of
people
organizations
in
a
community


each
of
these
networks
can
involve
social
support
provide
people
with
a
sense
of
community
and
lead
them
to
help
and
protect
each
other


how
big
a
personal
network
can
become
depends
on
the
individual
and
the
type
of
relationships
considered


the
set
of
people
that
a
person
knows
well
or
with
whom
a
person
frequently
interacts
seldom
exceeds
several
hundred


similarly
as
the
size
of
a
community
network
grows
maintaining
relationships
among
all
or
even
most
members
is
strained
by
sheer
size


there
is
a
law
of
which
suggests
that
about
persons
is
the
best
size
for
a
village
or
large
clan


many
experts
think
that
a
corporation
has
an
ideal
size
of
about
people
these
people
and
their
spouses
would
also
fit
as
a
large
social
network


social
capital
refers
to
properties
of
social
relationships
a
network
which
can
be
utilized
to
yield
a
desired
result
or
return
just
as
human
capital
are
skills
and
talents
resident
in
a
person
that
can
be
used
to
achieve
a
desired
result
and
economic
capital
are
material
items
that
can
be
used
to
yield
a
desired
result
new
product
profit


one
example
of
social
capital
is
people
in
a
community
network
who
are
willing
to
help
each
other


this
use
of
a
social
network
is
most
obvious
during
disaster
recovery


at
that
time
people
often
come
forward
to
help
each
other


other
examples
are
people
using
their
social
network
to
find
employment
or
to
aid
their
career


in
psychology
a
free
rider
is
a
person
who
uses
the
social
network
but
does
not
contribute
help
when
required


it
is
often
thought
that
power
structures
evolve
from
the
need
to
detect
and
exclude
such
free
riders
fact
date
july


social
networks
are
vulnerable
to
them
since
the
circumstances
where
help
is
required
like
disasters
occur
by
surprise


it
might
happen
that
someone
can
not
help
at
that
one
time
it
might
also
happen
that
they
are
not
there
the
next
time


only
after
a
lot
of
time
does
it
become
obvious
who
is
and
is
not
contributing
to
the
safety
of
the
group
or
who
is
avoiding
the
group
when
people
really
need
their
help


some
social
networks
are
held
together
by
the
ties
of
religion


a
mosque
church
or
temple
is
almost
always
a
center
of
a
social
network
and
often
that
network
has
a
name
and
an
identity
of
its
own
that
is
not
that
of
the
religious
organization

a
cabal
is
a
group
of
people
who
try
to
control
things
in
a
secret
way


sometimes
people
say
there
is
no
cabal
or
use
the
abbreviation
to
mean
there
is
no
cabal
but
since
a
cabal
is
necessarily
secret
they
can
not
know


current
usage
one
new
example
of
the
use
of
the
word
cabal
is
that
the
former
chief
of
staff
lawrence
of
the
secretary
of
state
colin
said
that
the
foreign
policy
of
george
bush
administration
were
run
by
a
cabal


with
this
word
he
meant
that
the
president
had
not
really
the
power
that
he
is
given
by
the
constitution
and
that
the
vice
president
and
the
secretary
of
defense
had
more
influence
than
they
should
have


creating
is
making
new
things
that
have
not
existed
before
usually
by
combining
two
or
three
things
that
existed


art
is
almost
always
called
creative
but
so
are
other
activities
like
music
mathematics
technology
business
craft
building
gardening
and
forestry
if
they
combine
things
to
get
new
things


when
several
people
cooperate
in
more
than
one
process
of
creating
that
is
a
creative
network


this
cuts
risk
since
anything
creative
involves
some
chance
that
it
will
simply
not
work


what
is
not
creative
is
usually
called
imitative
and
includes
anything
that
is
mostly
trying
not
to
do
what
has
never
been
done
like
law
sports
science
war
and
especially
education


these
involve
more
direct
competition
so
risk
comes
from
the
competitor
who
may
do
it
better


the
word
team
is
used
for
such
groups


most
people
fear
change
and
new
things
and
so
what
is
most
stable
and
considered
important
by
society
tends
to
be
imitative
and
done
in
teams


but
unless
society
encourages
creating
it
loses
out
to
others
by
competition
in
business
or
technology
so
there
must
be
some
creative
networks
somewhere
in
labs
or
art
studios


views
of
control
of
creative
work
also
depend
very
much
on
religious
and
spiritual
views
of
nature
or
a
creator
creating
man
according
to
economist
lester


those
<collocation>ethical traditions</collocation>
that
see
man
in
the
image
of
god
have
created
legal
codes
see
guild
intellectual
right
intellectual
interest
intellectual
property
to
tightly
control
what
they
are
creating
or
have
created


these
are
now
the
basis
of
organizations
such
as
or


often
such
laws
also
create
control
over
things
which
are
merely
found
not
created


many
people
give
away
what
they
have
created
and
never
think
about
it
as
property
other
people
try
to
control
it
and
get
paid
every
time
anyone
sees
it
or
even
every
time
they
just
talk
about
it


uses
the
gnu
which
is
a
content
license
that
tries
to
get
people
to
combine
what
they
are
creating
with
no
one
clearly
in
control


this
is
considered
strange
by
many
people
who
are
uncomfortable
with
that
idea
or
seek
to
control
some
aspect
of
it
themselves


human
science
is
the
science
of
humans
what
makes
them
different
from
animals
and
their
limits
which
tend
to
be
the
same
as
those
of
other
animals


because
human
bodies
are
animal
bodies
human
science
is
part
of
biology
which
leads
to
life
science


however
<collocation>human behavior</collocation>
includes
the
use
of
words
measures
numbers
knowing
time
and
having
memory
and
such
habits
as
trade
thus
economics
and
psychology
are
considered
to
be
part
of
human
science


a
general
human
science
is
anthropology
which
studies
only
the
differences
between
humans
and
near
relatives


one
important
debate
in
human
science
is
whether
the
exchange
of
culture
or
in
<collocation>economics instructional</collocation>
capital
is
only
among
humans
or
if
it
also
goes
on
among
our
great
ape
near
relatives


if
so
then
culture
is
part
of
and
there
is
no
clear
line
between
human
science
and
life
sciences


another
name
for
human
science
is
social
science
since
the
most
complex
thing
about
humans
is
how
they
relate
to
each
other
in
society


the
most
general
social
science
is
ethics
or
economics
depending
on
your
point
of
view


however
life
science
also
deals
with
humans
as
objects
of
study
notably
in
medicine
while
hard
science
such
as
chemistry
deals
with
humans
as
the
observer
who
does
the
study
sets
the
scale
at
which
observation
can
happen
incurs
observer
effects
as
studied
in
philosophy
of
science


often
sciences
have
different
names
based
on
whether
they
study
humans
or
not


for
instance
economics
is
the
study
of
how
humans
make
a
living
while
ecology
is
the
study
of
how
make
a
living


medicine
is
normally
restricted
to
humans
while
<collocation>veterinary medicine</collocation>
refers
to
the
same
techniques
made
on
other
species


one
relies
more
on
ethics
and
less
on
economics
when
dealing
with
humans
at
least
according
to
any
<collocation>ethical tradition</collocation>


the
living
social
and
sensory
observing
aspects
of
humans
are
probably
all
part
of
the
human
sciences
to
the
degree
they
affect
how
humans
view
themselves


specific
human
sciences
are
in
addition
to
anthropology
and
ethics
and
economics
include
psychology
sociology
and
linguistics


there
is
debate
as
to
whether
mathematics
is
something
human

if
it

universal

flaying
is
a
form
of
torture
mutilation
and
execution


it
is
the
act
of
stripping
the
skin

flesh
from
the

flaying
an

it

even
though
economics
is
all
about
choice
on
the
basis
of
what
is
available
rather
than
what
should
be
available
the
big
question
relates
to
who
decides
how
resources
should
be
distributed
and
how
economics
can
embrace
a
between
different
groups
which
each
seek
to
make
the
most
of
their
allocation
of
resources


if
what
should
be
can
not
be
incorporated
the
subject
of
economics
will
be
as
dry
as
desert
as
described
by
rand


the
challenge
therefore
is
to
construct
a
model
combining
what
is
to
what
should
be
and
make
the
same
acceptable
to
common
man
as
well
as
politicians


not
being
able
to
sell
the
idea
as
such
is
a
defeat
to
the
discipline


the
issue
is
that
of
influence
and
not
of
theory
as
adam
smith
perceived
that
no
group
of
business
men
ever
met
other
than
to
exploit
the
consumer
