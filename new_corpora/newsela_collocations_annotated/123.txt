at

holy
teacher


christians
believe
that
the
promised
messiah
was
jesus


his
mother
was
a
young
woman
called
mary
who
was
engaged
but
not
yet
married
to
a
carpenter
called
joseph


joseph
found
out
that
mary
was
pregnant
and
was
upset


he
was
wondering
what
he
should
do
when
an
angel
came
from
god
to
tell
him
that
the
baby
was
the
holy
one


the
angel
said
that
he
must
name
the
baby


this
was
a
sign
that
he
would
take
care
of
it
like
his
own
child


at
this
time
the
middle
east
was
ruled
by
the
romans


an
order
came
that
all
the
people
had
to
travel
back
to
their
home
town
to
put
their
names
on
the
<collocation>taxation lists</collocation>


joseph
took
his
new
wife
to
bethlehem


there
was
nowhere
for
them
to
stay
except
a
stable
where
the
animals
slept


this
is
where
the
baby
was
born


joseph
called
him
jesus
as
the
angel
had
said


the
baby
jesus
had
two
lots
of
visitors


on
the
night
he
was
born
angels
told
some
shepherds
in
the
fields
that
they
would
find
a
newborn
king
lying
in
an
animals
feed
bin
or
manger


jesus
other
visitors
were
some
<collocation>wise men</collocation>
who
saw
a
new
star
in
the
sky
and
followed
it
until
they
found
the
house
where
the
family
was
now
living
and
gave
the
young
child
expensive
gifts
of
gold
incense
and
a
precious
herb
called
myrrh


the
<collocation>wise men</collocation>
are
often
traditionally
called
the
three
kings
because
there
were
three
very
expensive
presents
but
the
bible
does
not
say
how
many
<collocation>wise men</collocation>
there
were


all
these
parts
of
the
christmas
story
are
remembered
and
celebrated
in
different
ways
at
christmas
in
pictures
songs
plays
stories
and
in
models
that
are
called
cribs
or


date
of
celebration
most
christian
countries
of
the
world
use
a
calendar
called
the
gregorian
calendar
but
some
churches
use
a
calendar
called
the
<collocation>julian calendar</collocation>


most
christians
such
as
those
of
the
catholic
and
protestant
churches
celebrate
the
birth
of
jesus
on
december


the
eastern
orthodox
church
still
uses
the
<collocation>julian calendar</collocation>
in
some
regions
such
as
russia


in
such
regions
christmas
is
celebrated
on
december
in
the
<collocation>julian calendar</collocation>
but
because
of
the
difference
between
the
calendars
it
is
the
of
january
in
the
modern
gregorian
calendar


some
christians
like
jehovah
witnesses
do
not
celebrate
christmas
because
there
is
no
instruction
from
jesus
in
the
bible
which
tells
christians
to
celebrate
his
birth


mormons
celebrate
christmas
on
december
but
they
believe
that
christ
actual
birth
took
place
on
april


some
fact
date
december
believe
that
jesus
was
probably
not
born
on
december


some
historians
fact
date
december
believe
this
date
was
used
by
the
catholic
church
to
replace
the
pagan
rites
that
took
place
at
that
time
of
the
year


advent
lighting
the
<collocation>advent candles</collocation>
at
a
church
in
the
us


the
season
of
advent
which
begins
on
sunday
about
four
weeks
before
christmas
day
is
celebrated
by
the
catholic
and
anglican
churches
as
well
as
others


it
is
a
time
for
people
to
prepare
themselves
for
two
different
things
for
the
coming
of
the
baby
jesus
and
christmas
and
for
the
second
coming
of
jesus
when
he
shall
rule
over
all
the
earth
in
peace


not
all
christian
people
remember
advent


some
people
use
it
as
a
time
of
fasting
study
meditation
and
prayer


special
advent
calendars
are
made
for
children
with
pictures
or
treats
for
each
day
of
advent


generally
advent
is
a
time
when
many
people
are
very
busy
in
preparation
for
christmas
day
cleaning
and
decorating
buying
food
and
presents
writing
cards
and
letters
and
cooking
the
christmas
feast


celebrations
before
the
century
ad
christians
could
only
worship
and
celebrate
in
secret


the
feast
of
christmas
probably
began
while
was
the
emperor
of
rome
because
it
was
he
who
made
christianity
a
legal
religion
and
built
some
of
rome
oldest
churches


some
old
<collocation>stone coffins</collocation>
or
sarcophagi
from
this
time
are
carved
with
pictures
of
mary
and
baby
jesus
and
the
<collocation>wise men</collocation>


through
the
<collocation>middle ages</collocation>
christmas
was
celebrated
with
feasting
singing
and
plays


the
plays
were
held
in
churches
and
also
in
castles
and
in
market
places
where
a
big
hay
wagon
was
sometimes
used
as
a
stage


because
advent
was
a
time
of
prayer
and
preparation
most
parties
were
held
after
christmas
rather
than
before
it


the
main
celebration
was
the
feast
of
nicholas
on
december


in
some
countries
particularly
the
netherlands
the
tradition
grew
for
children
to
receive
presents
on
this
day
rather
than
christmas
day


the
name
of
saint
nicholas
is
now
remembered
in
many
countries
as
<collocation>santa claus</collocation>


the
procession
of
st
lucy
sweden
another
festivity
that
takes
place
is
the
feast
of
saint
lucy
lucia
day
on
december
which
is
particularly
celebrated
in
scandinavia
where
girls
take
part
in
candlelit
processions
and
the
daughters
of
the
house
must
rise
early
to
bring
coffee
or
chocolate
to
the
family


for
many
centuries
the
celebration
of
christmas
often
began
with
a
church
service
or
mass
which
lasted
from
late
at
night
to
after
midnight
on
christmas
morning


christmas
day
was
a
time
of
feasting


on
the
following
day
the
feast
of
saint
stephen
people
from
rich
households
would
carry
boxes
of
food
out
to
the
street
for
the
poor
and
hungry


many
people
would
go
back
to
work
but
employers
would
give
gifts
of
money
to
their
workers


the
holy
days
continued
with
the
feast
of
saint
john
and
<collocation>holy innocents</collocation>
day
