into

around
the

making

the

country
in

the

responded
by
starting

and
soon
sent
up
its
own
satellites


the
soviet

also
sent

claiming
that
this

was
the

created
a

called

whereby
defense

was
cut
but
the

greatly
increased


this
policy
of

was
intended
to
intimidate

the

attempted
to

with

these

would
have
allowed

to
effectively

in
response
the

sent
a
large

to

cuba
thus
preventing

from

the

would
no

to

as

the

while

did

because

when

surfaces

are
bent

as
a

the
basic
cause
is
likely
to
be
some
aspect
of
plate
tectonics


when
two
forces
act
towards
each
other
from
opposite
sides
rock
layers
are
bent
into
folds


the
process
by
which
folds
are
formed
due

compression
is
known
as
folding


folding
is
one
of
the
processes
it
takes
place
within
the
earth
crust


folds
in

vary
in
size
from

three
types
of
plate
boundary


volcanism
or
volcanic
activity
is
the
eruption
of
magma
onto
the
surface
of
the
earth


it
is
an
process
caused
by
the
movement
of
plate
tectonics


magma
under
the
crust
is
under
very
great
pressure


when
folding
and
faulting
occur
cracks
or
fractures
appear


these
are
lines
of
weakness


when
these
lines
of
weakness
develop
downward
in
the
crust
and
reach
the
magma
they
will
release
the
pressure
in
the
magma


this
allows
magma
to
rise
up
along
the
lines
of
weakness
and
intrude
into
the
crust


some
magma
may
even
reach
the
earth
surface

volcanoes
main
volcano
volcanoes
are
places
where
magma
reaches
the
earth

the
type
of
volcano
depends
on
the
location
of
the
eruption
and
the
consistency
of
the
magma


intrusions
the
main
feature
of
the
devils
tower
national
monument
was
created
via
intrusion


main
intrusion
intrusive
volcanism
is
when
magma
is
forced
into
the
rocks
that
make
up
the
earth
crust


it
occurs
when
there
are
lines
of
weakness
such
as
faults
joints
or
bedding
planes
in
the
crust


then
magma
enters
these
lines
of
weakness


when
it
cools
and
become
solid
while
still
underground
different
features
called
plutons
are
formed


the
rock
formed
is
intrusive
igneous
rock


these
plutons
will
be
exposed
at
the
surface
of
land
when
the
overlying
rocks
are
removed
after
a

forces
its

when

it

such
volcanic

is
known

some
people
classified

pacific

a
map
of
the
pacific
ocean


it
is
ringed
by
many
volcanoes
and
<collocation>oceanic trenches</collocation>


the
pacific
ocean
is
the
body
of
water
between
asia
and
australia
in
the
west
the
americas
in
the
east
the
southern
ocean
to
the
south
and
the
arctic
ocean
to
the
north


it
is
the
largest
named
ocean
and
it
covers
of
the
surface
of
the
entire
world


it
joins
the
atlantic
ocean
at
a
line
drawn
south
from
<collocation>cape horn</collocation>
chile
argentina
to
antarctica
and
joins
the
<collocation>indian ocean</collocation>
at
a
line
drawn
south
from
australia
to
antarctica


as
the
atlantic
slowly
gets
wider
the
pacific
is
slowly
shrinking


it
does
this
by
folding
the
sea
floor
in
towards
the
center
of
the
earth
this
is
called
subduction


this
bumping
and
grinding
is
hard
so
there
are
many
earthquakes
and
volcanoes
when
the
pressure
builds
up
and
is
quickly
released
as
large
explosions
of
hot
rocks
and
dust


when
an
earthquake
happens
under
the
sea
the
quick
jerk
causes
a
tsunami


this
is
why
tsunamis
are
more
common
around
the
edge
of
the
pacific
than
anywhere
else


many
of
the
earth
volcanoes
are
either
islands
in
the
pacific
or
are
on
continents
within
a
few
hundred
kilometers
of
the
ocean
edge


plate
tectonics
are
another
reason
which
makes
pacific
ocean
smaller
