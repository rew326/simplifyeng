its
<collocation>curved ceiling</collocation>
was
held
up
by
twelve
pieces
of
wall
called


pope
julius
told
michelangelo
to
paint
one
of
the
twelve
apostles
of
jesus
on
each


michelangelo
started
to
do
this


then
he
got
a
different
idea
and
scraped
off
the
work
that
he
had
done


instead
of
apostles
he
painted
twelve
prophets


seven
of
them
were
men
from
the
<collocation>old testament</collocation>
but
the
other
five
were
women
and
did
not
come
from
the
bible


they
were
five
prophets
from
the
classical
world


like
the
prophets
in
the
bible
they
had
all
told
people
about
the
birth
of
jesus


on
the
middle
of
the
ceiling
instead
of
painting
a
<collocation>starry sky</collocation>
michelangelo
painted
scenes
from
the
bible
telling
the
story
of
creation
and
the
downfall
of
humanity


the
most
famous
scene
is
the
picture
of
god
creating
adam


the
ceiling
was
so
famous
that
many
artists
tried
to
copy
the
way
that
michelangelo
had
arranged
and
painted
the
figures


buildings
and
tombs
in
florence
in
pope
julius
ii
died


the
next
pope
was
pope
leo
x
a
member
of
the
family


he
gave
michelangelo
several
jobs
in
florence
including
designing
the
chapel
to
hold
the
tombs
of
his
family
members


although
not
all
the
tombs
were
built
michelangelo
finished
seven
large
statues
including
a
madonna
and
child


his
pupils
later
completed
the
chapel


in
the
people
of
florence
became
angry
at
the
for
acting
like
princes


that
was
not
the
right
way
for
a
family
to
act
in
a
city
that
was
a
republic


the
people
threw
the
out
but
the
came
back
with
an
army
and
took
over
the
city


michelangelo
was
so
upset
at
the
behavior
of
the
that
he
left
his
beloved
city
and
never
went
back


the
<collocation>last judgement</collocation>
the
<collocation>last judgement</collocation>
pope
clement
called
michelangelo
back
to
the
sistine
chapel
to
paint
the
wall
behind
the
altar
with
a
huge
scene
of
the
<collocation>last judgement</collocation>


he
worked
on
it
from
to


at
the
center
it
shows
jesus
surrounded
by
saints
sitting
in
judgement
over
the
people
of
the
earth


to
the
left
people
are
rising
from
their
graves
and
many
are
welcomed
into
heaven


to
the
right
other
people
are
being
sent
to
hell
where
they
are
dragged
down
by
demons


it
is
a
huge
painting
with
many
figures
in
it


like
adam
and
eve
on
the
ceiling
all
the
figures
were
shown
naked


some
of
the
cardinals
in
the
church
said
that
it
was
wicked
to
paint
saints
including
the
virgin
mary
with
no
clothes
on


they
called
michelangelo
the
painter
of
<collocation>rude bits</collocation>


there
was
a
long
argument
about
this
because
some
people
said
that
god
had
created
everyone
naked
so
clothes
would
not
be
needed
in
heaven


after
michelangelo
death
another
artist
da
was
called
in
to
paint
drapes
on
the
figures


for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
was
known
as
the
painter
of
pants


st
peter
basilica
the
dome
of
st
peter
basilica
is
michelangelo
most
famous
work
of
architecture
in
when
michelangelo
was
his
seventies
he
was
given
one
of
his
most
important
jobs


the
old
st
peter
basilica
had
been
partly
demolished
and
a
new
one
designed
by


but
many
architects
had
worked
on
it
and
it
was
still
just
at
the
beginning
stages


michelangelo
was
made
the
architect


he
immediately
improved
the
plan
had
important
parts
made
much
stronger
and
designed
a
huge
dome
taller
than
any
other
dome
in
the
world


he
died
before
it
was
completed
but
he
left
drawings
and
models
so
that
the
next
architect
della
porta
could
finish
what
he
had
started


the
dome
of
peter
basilica
still
stands
as
one
of
the
greatest
monuments
of
christianity
and
as
a
symbol
of
the
city
of
rome


when
michelangelo
died
his
body
was
taken
back
to
florence
and
buried
in
the
basilica
of
santa
church
of
the
holy
cross


on
his
tomb
sit
three
mourning
figures
who
symbolize
architecture
painting
and
sculpture

why
was
leonardo
<collocation>da vinci</collocation>
that
famous


leonardo
<collocation>da vinci</collocation>
april
may
was
an
italian
<collocation>renaissance genius</collocation>


he
was
good
at
many
things
but
was
most
famous
as
a
painter


he
was
also
a
scientist
a
mathematician
an
engineer
an
inventor
an
anatomist
a
sculptor
an
architect
a
botanist
a
musician
and
a
writer


leonardo
was
curious
about
everything
in
nature


he
wanted
to
know
how
everything
worked


he
was
very
good
at
studying
designing
and
making
all
sorts
of
interesting
things


many
people
think
that
leonardo
was
one
of
the
<collocation>greatest painters</collocation>
of
all
time


many
people
think
that
he
was
the
most
talented
person
ever
to
have
lived


the
art
historian
helen
said
that
has
ever
been
quite
like
him
because
he
was
interested
in
so
many
things
that
he
seems
to
have
had
the
mind
of
a
giant
and
yet
what
he
was
like
as
a
person
is
still
a
mystery


leonardo
was
born
at
vinci
which
is
a
small
town
near
florence
in
italy


he
was
trained
to
be
an
artist
by
the
sculptor
and
painter


he
spent
most
of
his
life
working
for
rich
italian
noblemen


in
his
last
years
he
lived
in
a
beautiful
home
given
to
him
by
the
king
of
france


leonardo
could
do
all
sorts
of
clever
things
but
he
was
most
famous
as
a
painter


two
of
his
pictures
are
among
the
paintings
in
the
world
the
mona
and
the
<collocation>last supper</collocation>


he
did
many
drawings


the
drawing
is
<collocation>vitruvian man</collocation>


it
is
so
well
known
that
even
homer
simpson
and
garfield
have
been
drawn
in
a
square
and
a
circle
to
look
like
the
drawing


leonardo
was
always
thinking
of
new
inventions


most
of
his
inventions
were
never
made


however
we
know
his
ideas
because
he
kept
notebooks


he
wrote
and
drew
in
them
very
often


some
of
the
ideas
that
he
thought
of
were
a
helicopter
a
tank
a
calculator
a
parachute
a
robot
and
solar
power

leonardo
earliest
known
drawing
the
valley


it
can
be
found
in
the
gallery


leonardo
was
born
on
april
in
the
tuscan
hill
town
of
vinci
in
the
valley
of
the
river


his
grandfather
ser
antonio
wrote
down
the
details
of
the
birth


leonardo
parents
were
not
married


his
father
was
a
lawyer
messer
di
antonio
<collocation>da vinci</collocation>


his
mother
was
a
servant


she
may
have
been
a
slave
from
the
middle
east


leonardo
full
name
was
leonardo
di
ser
<collocation>da vinci</collocation>
which
means
leonardo
the
son
of
messer
mister
from
vinci


leonardo
spent
his
first
five
years
living
in
a
farm
house
with
his
mother


then
he
lived
at
vinci
with
his
father
his
father
wife
his
grandparents
and
uncle


when
leonardo
grew
up
he
only
wrote
down
two
things
about
his
childhood


he
remembered
that
when
he
was
lying
outside
in
his
cradle
a
large
bird
flew
from
the
sky
and
hovered
over
him


its
tail
feathers
brushed
his
face


leonardo
other
important
memory
was
how
he
found
a
cave
while
exploring
in
the
mountains


he
was
terrified
that
some
great
monster
might
be
hiding
there


but
he
was
also
very
excited
and
curious
to
find
out
what
was
inside


leonardo
started
painting
while
he
was
still
a
boy


wrote
about
leonardo
life
shortly
after
his
death


he
tells
many
interesting
stories
about
how
clever
leonardo
was


he
says
that
leonardo
painted
a
round
wooden
shield
with
a
picture
of
snakes
spitting
fire


messer
took
his
son
painting
to
florence
and
sold
it
to
an
art
dealer


the
baptism
of
christ
by
and
leonardo
workshop
in
when
leonardo
was
fourteen
his
father
took
him
to
florence
to
be
an
apprentice
to
the
artist


florence
was
a
very
exciting
place
for
a
young
person
who
wanted
to
be
an
artist


many
famous
artists
had
lived
in
florence
starting
with
and
in
the


everywhere
a
person
looked
there
were
famous
and
<collocation>beautiful artworks</collocation>


the
huge
cathedral
had
an
enormous
new
dome


the
church
of
st
john
had
doors
that
gleamed
with
gold
and
were
said
to
be
the
most
beautiful
doors
in
the
world


another
church
had
statues
all
around
it
by
the
most
famous
sculptors
including
one
by
leonardo
teacher


if
an
artist
was
lucky
they
would
find
a
rich
patron
who
would
buy
lots
of
their
paintings


the
richest
family
in
florence
were
the


they
had
built
themselves
the
<collocation>finest palace</collocation>
in
florence
and
liked
buying
paintings
statues
and
other
beautiful
things


they
were
also
interested
in
the
study
of
literature
and
philosophy


many
young
artists
hope
to
get
work
from
the
and
their
friends


had
a
big
workshop
that
was
one
of
the
busiest
in
florence


leonardo
was
learning
to
be
an
artist
so
he
had
to
learn
drawing
painting
sculpting
and
model
making


while
he
was
at
the
workshop
he
was
able
to
learn
all
sorts
of
other
useful
skills
chemistry
metallurgy
metal
working
plaster
casting
leather
working
mechanics
and
carpentry


leonardo
was
not
the
only
young
painter
at
workshop


many
other
painters
were
trained
there
or
often
visited


some
of
them
later
became
famous
and
botticelli


these
artists
were
all
just
a
few
years
older
than
leonardo


tells
an
interesting
story
from
this
time
of
leonardo
life


was
painting
a
large
picture
of
the
baptism
of
christ


he
gave
leonardo
the
job
of
painting
one
of
the
angels
holding
jesus
robe
on
the
left
side
of
the
picture


said
that
leonardo
painted
the
angel
so
beautifully
that
put
down
his
brush
and
never
painted
again


when
the
painting
is
examined
closely
it
is
possible
to
see
that
many
other
parts
of
the
picture
such
as
the
rocks
the
brown
stream
and
the
background
may
have
been
painted
by
leonardo
as
well


made
a
bronze
statue
of
david
at
this
time


it
is
believed
that
he
used
leonardo
as
his
model


in
about
when
he
was
twenty
leonardo
joined
the
guild
of
st
luke
an
organization
of
artists
and
doctors
of
medicine


even
after
his
father
set
him
up
in
his
own
workshop
leonardo
still
enjoyed
working
at
workshop


leonardo
earliest
known
work
is
a
drawing
in
pen
and
ink
of
the
river
valley


it
has
the
date
august


it
is
now
in
the
gallery


working
life
the
adoration
of
the
magi
in
the
gallery
when
writes
about
leonardo
he
uses
words
like
noble
generous
graceful
and
beautiful


tells
us
that
as
an
adult
leonardo
was
a
<collocation>tall handsome</collocation>
man


he
was
so
strong
that
he
could
bend
horseshoes
with
his
bare
hands


his
voice
was
so
beautiful
that
it
charmed
everyone
that
heard
it


almost
everyone
wanted
to
be
his
friend


he
loved
animals
was
a
vegetarian
and
would
buy
birds
at
the
market
and
set
them
free


very
little
is
known
about
leonardo
life
and
work
between
and


he
was
probably
busy
in
florence


in
he
had
an
important
commission
to
paint
an
altarpiece
for
the
monks
of
san
a


the
painting
was
to
be
the
adoration
of
the
magi
the
three
<collocation>wise men</collocation>


the
painting
was
never
finished
because
leonardo
was
sent
away
to
milan


leonardo
was
a
very
talented
musician


in
he
made
a
<collocation>silver lyre</collocation>
a
musical
instrument
in
the
shape
of
a
horse
head


at
that
time
there
was
a
new
ruler
in
the
city
of
milan
in
the
north
of
italy


duke
il
moro
was
making
other
rulers
nervous


sent
leonardo
to
milan
as
an
ambassador


de
wanted
leonardo
to
give
the
lyre
as
a
present
from
him


leonardo
wrote
a
letter
to
the
duke
of
milan
telling
him
about
all
the
clever
and
useful
things
that
he
could
do
like
making
war
machines


he
wrote
in
the
letter
that
he
could
also
paint


leonardo
did
not
know
at
the
time
that
it
was
for
painting
that
he
would
be
mostly
remembered


leonardo
stayed
in
milan
and
worked
for
the
duke
between
and


part
of
his
work
was
to
design
festivals
and
carnival
processions


in
leonardo
note
books
are
drawings
of
theater
costumes
amazing
helmets
and
scenes
that
might
be
for
the
theater


virgin
of
the
rocks
louvre
possibly


leonardo
like
most
other
artists
of
his
time
had
servants
young
students
and
older
assistants
in
his
workshop


one
of
his
young
students
was
a
boy
whose
name
was
da


he
was
a
<collocation>handsome boy</collocation>
with
beautiful
long
golden
curls


he
looked
perfect
as
an
artist
model
for
an
angel


but
he
was
such
a
difficult
and
<collocation>dishonest boy</collocation>
that
leonardo
called
him
or
which
means
the
little
devil


leonardo
wrote
in
his
notebook
that
was
very
greedy
that
he
was
a
liar
and
that
he
had
stolen
things
from
the
house
at
least
five
times


stayed
in
leonardo
household
for
thirty
years
as
a

a
servant

leonardo
most
important
work
for

was
to
make
a
huge
statue
of
the
previous
ruler
on
horseback


he
started
with
the
horse


after
studying
horses
and
drawing
designs
he
made
a
huge
horse
of
clay


it
was
called
the
gran


it
was
going
to
be
cast
in
bronze


it
was
going
to
be
the
biggest
bronze
horse
that
had
been
made
for
more
than
a
thousand
years


unfortunately
the
bronze
horse
was
never
made


in
gave
the
bronze
to
be
made
into
cannons
because
the
french
army
was
invading
milan


the
huge
clay
horse
was
still
standing
when
the
french
army
invaded
again
in


this
time
it
was
used
for
target
practice
and
was
completely
destroyed

for
the
of

with
the
monks
in
milan
and
took
the
other

it
is
now
