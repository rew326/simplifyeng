history
the
piano
was
invented
by
of
italy


he
made
his
first
piano
in


it
developed
from
the
clavichord
which
looks
like
a
piano
but
the
strings
of
a
clavichord
are
hit
by
a
small
blade
of
metal
called
a
tangent


in
the
piano
the
strings
are
hit
by
a
hammer


the
early
instruments
such
as
the
and
organs
that
were
used
at
that
time
had
a
much
shorter
keyboard
than
they
do
today


gradually
the
keyboard
became
longer
until
it
had
the
notes
octaves
plus
three
notes
of
the
modern
piano


at
first
the
instrument
was
called
the


this
means
in
italian


it
was
given
this
name
because
it
could
be
played
either
loudly
or
softly
depending
on
how
hard
the
note
was
hit
the
harpsichord
could
not
do
this
and
the
clavichord
could
only
make
a
tiny
difference
between
louder
and
softer


later
this
name
changed
to
pianoforte


this
is
normally
shortened
to
piano


the
word
is
sometimes
used
to
describe
the
pianos
of
the
late
and
early
centuries


in
some
languages
such
as
russian
is
the
normal
word
for
a
piano


a
upright
piano
although
the
piano
was
invented
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
it
was
not
until
years
later
that
it
started
to
become
popular


the
first
time
the
piano
was
played
in
a
public
concert
in
london
was
in
when
it
was
played
by
christian
bach


the
upright
piano
was
invented
in
by
john
isaac


seven
years
later
invented


this
means
that
the
strings
for
the
low
notes
go
diagonally
across
the
so
that
they
can
be
longer
and
make
a
much
bigger
sound


the
early
pianos
had
strings
that
were
fastened
to
a
frame
made
of
wood


they
were
not
very
heavy
but
they
were
not
very
strong
or
loud
so
they
could
not
be
heard
very
well
in
a
big
<collocation>concert hall</collocation>


in
the
frame
was
invented
in
america


this
made
the
piano
much
stronger
so
that
it
could
make
a
bigger
sound
and
the
strings
were
not
likely
to
break


piano
parts
inside
an
upright
piano
a
piano
has
a
keyboard
with
white
keys
and
black
keys


when
a
key
is
pressed
down
the
damper
comes
off
the
string
and
a
hammer
hits
the
string


it
hits
it
very
quickly
and
bounces
off
so
that
the
string
is
free
to
vibrate
and
make
a
sound


when
the
player
takes
his
finger
off
the
key
the
damper
falls
back
onto
the
string
and
the
sound
stops


the
strings
are
stretched
very
tightly
across
the
frame
passing
over
a
bridge
on
the
way


the
bridge
touches
the


this
means
that
the
vibrations
are
sent
to
the


the
is
a
very
important
part
of
the
piano


if
it
is
damaged
the
piano
will
not
make
a
sound


the
mechanism
which
makes
the
<collocation>hammer bounce</collocation>
off
the
string
very
quickly
is
called
the


in
invented
a
kind
of
double


this
made
it
possible
to
repeat
the
note
very
quickly


the
hammer
only
touches
the
string
for
about
one
thousandth
of
a
second


the
hammers
are
covered
with
felt
which
is
a
mixture
of
wool
silk
and
hair


the
piano
has
two
pedals


<collocation>larger pianos</collocation>
have
three


the
damper
pedal
this
pedal
is
on
the
right


when
a
pianist
presses
it
down
with
his
right
foot
any
notes
he
plays
will
keep
on
sounding
even
when
he
takes
his
finger
off
the
note


this
is
because
there
are
dampers
they
look
a
bit
like
the
hammers
that
rest
on
all
the
strings


when
the
pianist
holds
the
right
pedal
down
all
the
dampers
come
off
the
strings
so
that
the
strings
are
free
to
vibrate


when
a
note
is
played
that
note
will
continue
to
sound


some
other
strings
will
also
vibrate
very
lightly
this
is
called
sympathetic
vibration


it
will
make
the
sound
smoother
and
richer


pianists
have
to
learn
how
to
use
the
pedal
well


this
will
depend
on
such
things
as
the
style
of
the
music
the
size
of
the
piano
the
size
of
the
room
and
whether
there
is
a
lot
of
furnishing
there


the
soft
pedal
the
soft
pedal
is
on
the
left


when
a
pianist
presses
it
down
with
his
left
foot
the
notes
<collocation>sound quieter</collocation>


on
a
grand
piano
the
whole
keyboard
and
action
shift
a
bit
to
the
left
so
that
the
hammers
only
hit
two
strings
instead
of
three


also
the
parts
of
the
felt
which
hit
the
string
are
softer
because
they
have
not
become
hard
with
lots
of
use


the
soft
pedal
is
normally
kept
down
for
the
whole
of
a
piece
or
the
whole
of
a
section
of
a
piece


this
pedal
is
sometimes
called
the
una
pedal


una
means
one
string


this
is
because
in
the
early
pianos
it
was
possible
to
press
the
pedal
a
little
way
so
that
the
hammers
hit
two
strings
then
press
it
further
so
that
they
hit
only
one
string


this
is
why
the
sign
to
tell
a
pianist
to
use
the
left
pedal
is
una


to
cancel
the
left
pedal
the
composer
writes
three
strings
in
the
music


the
middle
pedal
is
called
the
pedal


like
the
right
pedal
it
keeps
the
sound
going
but
it
only
affects
notes
that
are
already
being
played
at
the
moment
when
the
middle
pedal
is
pressed
down


this
makes
it
possible
to
keep
one
chord
going
while
playing
other
notes
that
will
not
carry
on


all
concert
<collocation>grand pianos</collocation>
have
a
pedal
and
some
modern
upright
pianos
do
as
well


some
upright
pianos
have
a
middle
pedal
that
is
not
a
pedal
at
all
but
a
practice
pedal


it
places
a
piece
of
cloth
in
front
of
the
strings
that
makes
the
sound
very
quiet
indeed
so
that
a
pianist
can
practice
without
disturbing
other
people


the
sound
of
a
piano
with
a
practice
piano
is
very
limited
and
different


the
practice
pedal
can
usually
be
pressed
down
and
put
in
a
slot
so
that
it
will
stay
in
place

playing
the
piano
the
piano
has
been
a
very
popular
instrument
ever
since
the
mid
century
when
it
soon
replaced
the
clavichord
and
the
harpsichord


by
the
early
century
the
sound
that
the
piano
made
was
big
enough
to
fill
large
concert
halls


<collocation>smaller pianos</collocation>
were
made
for
use
in
people
homes


at
first
these
included
square
pianos
and
giraffe
pianos
later
on
the
upright
pianos
became
popular
for
home
use


pianos
are
not
often
used
in
orchestras
if
they

pianists
have
to
learn
many
things


it
is
important
to
sit
comfortably
with
a
straight
back
so
that
hands
can
reach
all
the
keys


the
hands
should
be
shaped
like
a
ball
so
that
the
fingers
are
curved


they
should
be
able

control
the
sound
they

and
fingers


lots
of
practice
is
needed
to
become
a
good
pianist


some
people

become
a
better
pianist
and
musician

hedonism

a
type

philosophy


hedonism
can
be
generally
summed
up
as
a
belief
that
pleasure
is
the
highest
good
or
that
whatever
causes
pleasure
is
right


in
hedonism
people
think
that
what

good


things

good

beliefs

hedonism

as
many
pleasurable
experiences
as

the
quality

the
<collocation>pleasure matters</collocation>

many

also
believe
hedonism
is
related
to
sex


this
is
not
true


sex
can
be
a
very
<collocation>pleasurable experience</collocation>
but
when
philosophers
talk
about
hedonism
they
think
more
about
the
pleasure
of
reading
a

book
listening
to
classical
music
or
discussing
with
other
philosophers


two
types
of
hedonism

where

like
to
be

do
so

that

<collocation>bullet train</collocation>
is
the
english
translation
of
the
japanese
word
which
was
the
name
given
to
the
project
while
it
was
being
made
in
the


nowadays
the
trains
are
called
trains


the
name
means
new
<collocation>trunk line</collocation>


the
trains
are
called
super
expresses


history
japan
was
the
first
country
to
build
railway
lines
for
high
speed
travel


because
japan
has
many
mountains
the
network
that
already
existed
was
made
of
gauge
mm
<collocation>narrow gauge</collocation>
lines
which
tended
to
take
routes
and
could
not
be
adapted
to
higher
speeds


because
of
this
japan
had
a
greater
need
for
new
high
speed
lines
than
countries
where
the
existing
<collocation>standard gauge</collocation>
or
<collocation>broad gauge</collocation>
rail
system
could
be
upgraded
easily


unlike
the
older
lines
lines
are
<collocation>standard gauge</collocation>
and
use
tunnels
and
viaducts
to
go
through
and
over
obstacles
rather
than
around
them


construction
of
the
first
section
of
the
between
tokyo
and
osaka
started
in


the
line
opened
on
october
just
in
time
for
the
tokyo
olympics


the
line
was
an
<collocation>immediate success</collocation>
reaching
the
million
passenger
mark
in
less
than
three
years
on
july
and
one
billion
passengers
in


the
first
trains
ran
at
speeds
of
up
to
mph
later
increased
to
mph


some
of
these
trains
with
their
classic
appearance
are
still
in
use
for
stopping
services
between
and
osaka


a
driving
car
from
one
of
the
original
trains
is
now
in
the
british
national
railway
museum
in
york


many
more
advanced
models
of
train
followed
the
first
type
generally
each
with
its
own
distinctive
appearance


trains
now
run
regularly
at
speeds
of
up
to
mph
putting
them
among
the
fastest
trains
running
in
the
world
along
with
the
french
and
german
<collocation>ice trains</collocation>


originally
meant
to
carry
passenger
and
freight
trains
by
day
and
night
the
lines
carry
only
passenger
trains


the
system
shuts
down
between
midnight
and
every
day
to
allow
maintenance
to
take
place
including
the
running
of
doctor
yellow
test
trains


the
few
overnight
trains
that
still
run
in
japan
run
on
the
old
<collocation>narrow gauge</collocation>
network
which
the
runs
parallel
to


in
jr
reported
that
the
average
arrival
time
was
within
seconds
of
the
scheduled
time


this
includes
all
natural
and
human
accidents
and
errors
and
is
calculated
from
about
trips
made


the
previous
record
was
from
and
was
seconds


the
first
derailment
of
a
train
in
passenger
service
occurred
during
the
earthquake
on
october


of
the
total
of
cars
of
the
train
on
the
derailed
near
station
in


future
in
recent
years
due
to
<collocation>noise pollution</collocation>
increasing
speed
is
getting
harder


thus
the
current
research
is
aimed
to
reduce
the
amount
of
noise
mainly
when
trains
exit
a
tunnel
