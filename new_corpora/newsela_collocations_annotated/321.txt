local
government
washington
is
not
a
state
and
its
citizens
have
less
control
over
their
city
than
most
americans


while
has
an
elected
mayor
and
a
city
council
since
the
congress
controls
the
local
government
and
can
overturn
or
get
rid
of
any
local
laws


congress
and
the
people
of
often
do
not
agree
on
what
is
best


the

mayor
of
washington
is
vincent
gray
a
democrat


in
congress
the
license
plates
on

in
washington
say
taxation
without
representation


this
is
a
protest
from
people
who
live
in
washington
about
having
to
pay
taxes
to
the
united
states
without
having
a
vote
in
the
united
states
house
of
representatives


it
resembles
the
protest
made
by
colonists
before
the
american
revolution
about
having
to
pay
taxes
to
england


some
people
are
against
letting
washington
have
a
congressman
or
congresswoman
because
the
constitution
only
allows
states
to
have
congressman
or


other
people
are
against
it
because
washington
government
is
almost
completely
democratic
party
controlled

a
group
of
teens
adolescence
is
the
time
between
being
a
child
and
full
adult
that
is
the
period
of
time
during
which
a
person
is
biologically
physically
adult
but
emotionally
feelings
not
at
full
maturity


the
ages
which
are
considered
to
be
part
of
adolescence
vary
by
culture
but
in
the
united
states
adolescence
is
usually
considered
to
begin
around
age
and
end
around


in
the
english
language
adolescents
people
going
through
adolescence
are
frequently
called
teenagers
or
teens
which
comes
from
the
end
the
english
words
thirteen
to
nineteen


adolescence
is
cultural
and
so
does
not
refer
to
a
fixed
time
period


the
word
comes
from
the
latin
verb
meaning
to
grow
up


during
this
time
a
person
body
emotions
and
academic
standing
change
a
lot


when
adolescence
happens
in
america
children
usually
finish
elementary
school
and
enter
secondary
education
such
as
middle
school
or
<collocation>high school</collocation>


during
this
period
of
life
most
children
go
through
the
physical
stages
of
puberty
which
often
begin
before
a
person
has
reached
the
age
of


most
cultures
think
of
people
as
becoming
adults
at
various
ages
of
the
teenage
years


for
example
jewish
tradition
thinks
that
people
are
adults
at
age
and
this
change
is
celebrated
in
the
bar
mitzvah
for
boys
and
the
bat
mitzvah
for
girls
ceremony


usually
there
is
a
formal
age
of
majority
when
adolescents
formally
under
the
law
become
adults

from

i
good
memory
of

this
is
a
<collocation>baritone saxophone</collocation>
a
saxophone
is
a
musical
instrument
that
is
made
of
brass
and
often
just
called
a
sax


due
to
the
fact
it
is
made
from
brass
it
is
often
involved
in
what
is
referred
to
as
a
brass
section
alongside
true
brass
instruments
like
the
trumpet
or
trombone


however
it
is
not
a
true
brass
instrument
but
a
member
of
the
woodwind
family
of
instruments
because
it
has
a
reed


it
was
developed
from
the
clarinet
and
shares
many
similarities
to
the
clarinet


the
player
blows
into
a
reed
fitted
into
the
mouthpiece
of
the
instrument


there
are
several
different
kinds
of
saxophone


in
order
from
low
to
high
pitch
they
are
bass
baritone
tenor
alto
soprano
and


however
only
the
baritone
tenor
alto
and
soprano
are
commonly
used


it
was
invented
in
by
sax
and
is
used
in
classical
jazz
and
occasionally
in
rock
pop
and
other
styles


the
big
bands
of
the
and
always
used
it
too


famous
saxophone
players
were
<collocation>marcel mule</collocation>
classical
music
and
charlie
parker
jazz
music


the
saxophone
family
is
known
as
a
family
of
instruments
due
to
the
fact
that
you
do
not
have
to
alter
the
fingering
when
playing
different
ones
