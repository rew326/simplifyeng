if
you
were
pushing
a
<collocation>baby buggy</collocation>
at
a
slow
walk
and
found
it
easy
to
push
but
pushed
it
at
a
fast
walk
and
found
it
harder
to
move
then
you
would
wonder
what
was
wrong
with
the
<collocation>baby buggy</collocation>


then
if
you
tried
to
run
and
found
that
moving
the
buggy
at
any
faster
speed
was
like
pushing
against
a
brick
wall
you
would
be
very
surprised


the
truth
is
that
when
something
is
moved
then
its
mass
is
increased


human
beings
ordinarily
do
not
notice
this
increase
in
mass
because
at
the
speed
humans
ordinarily
move
the
increase
in
mass
in
almost
nothing


as
speeds
get
closer
to
the
speed
of
light
then
the
changes
in
mass
become
impossible
not
to
notice


the
basic
experience
we
all
share
in
daily
life
is
that
the
harder
we
push
something
like
a
car
the
faster
we
can
get
it
going


but
when
something
we
are
pushing
is
already
going
at
some
large
part
of
the
speed
of
light
we
find
that
it
keeps
gaining
mass
so
it
gets
harder
and
harder
to
get
it
going
faster


it
is
impossible
to
make
any
mass
go
at
the
speed
of
light
because
to
do
so
would
take
infinite
energy


sometimes
a
mass
will
change
to
energy


common
examples
of
elements
that
make
these
changes
we
call
radioactivity
are
radium
and
uranium


an
atom
of
uranium
can
lose
an
alpha
particle
the
atomic
nucleus
of
helium
and
become
a
new
element
with
a
lighter
nucleus


then
that
atom
will
emit
two
electrons
but
it
will
not
be
stable
yet


it
will
emit
a
series
of
alpha
particles
and
electrons
until
it
finally
becomes
the
element
or
what
we
call
lead


by
throwing
out
all
these
particles
that
have
mass
it
has
made
its
own
mass
smaller


it
has
also
produced
energy


in
most
radioactivity
the
entire
mass
of
something
does
not
get
changed
to
energy


in
an
atomic
bomb
uranium
is
transformed
into
krypton
and
barium


there
is
a
slight
difference
in
the
mass
of
the
resulting
krypton
and
barium
and
the
mass
of
the
original
uranium
but
the
energy
that
is
released
by
the
change
is
huge


one
way
to
express
this
idea
is
to
write
einstein
equation
as
e
m
uranium
m
krypton
and
barium
c
the
c
in
the
equation
stands
for
the
speed
of
light
squared


to
square
something
means
to
multiply
it
by
itself
so
if
you
were
to
square
the
speed
of
light
it
would
be
meters
per
second
times
meters
per
second
which
is
approximately
meters
seconds
meters
seconds
so
the
energy
produced
by
one
kilogram
would
be
e
kg
meters
seconds
e
kg
meters
seconds
or
e
joules
or
e
about
were
released
by
the
atomic
bomb
that
exploded
over
hiroshima


so
about
of
a
gram
of
the
radioactive
mass
in
that
atomic
bomb
must
have
been
lost
changed
into
energy
when
the
uranium
changed
into
krypton
and
barium


bec
the
idea
of
a
came
out
of
a
collaboration
between
bose
and
einstein


einstein
himself
did
not
invent
it
but
instead
refined
the
idea
and
helped
it
become
popular


momentum
mass
and
energy
statue
of
albert
einstein
in
the
israel
academy
of
sciences
and
humanities


in
classical
physics
momentum
is
explained
by
the
equation
p
where
p
represents
momentum
m
represents
mass
v
represents
velocity
speed
when
einstein
generalized
classical
physics
to
include
the
increase
of
mass
due
to
the
velocity
of
the
moving
matter
he
arrived
at
an
equation
that
predicted
energy
to
be
made
of
two
components


one
component
involves
rest
mass
and
the
other
component
involves
momentum
but
momentum
is
not
defined
in
the
classical
way


the
equation
typically
has
values
greater
than
zero
for
both
components
e
m
c
pc
where
e
represents
the
energy
of
a
particle
m
represents
the
mass
of
the
particle
when
it
is
not
moving
p
represents
the
momentum
of
the
particle
when
it
is
moving
c
represents
the
speed
of
light


there
are
two
special
cases
of
this
equation


einstein
in
his
later
years
a
photon
has
no
rest
mass
but
it
has
momentum


light
reflecting
from
a
mirror
pushes
the
mirror
with
a
force
that
can
be
measured


in
the
case
of
a
photon
because
its
m
then
e
pc
e
<collocation>pc p</collocation>
the
energy
of
a
photon
can
be
computed
from
its
frequency
or
wavelength


these
are
related
to
each
other
by
relation
e
where
h
is
the
constant


knowing
either
frequency
or
wavelength
you
can
compute
the
photon
momentum


in
the
case
of
<collocation>motionless particles</collocation>
with
mass
since
p
then
e
m
c
which
is
just
e
m
c
therefore
the
quantity
m
used
in
einstein
equation
is
sometimes
called
the
rest
mass


the
reminds
us
that
we
are
talking
about
the
energy
and
mass
when
the
speed
is


this
famous
relation
formula
usually
written
without
the
suggests
that
mass
has
a
large
amount
of
energy
so
maybe
we
could
convert
some
mass
to
a
more
useful
form
of
energy


the
nuclear
power
industry
is
based
on
that
idea


einstein
said
that
it
was
not
a
<collocation>good idea</collocation>
to
use
the
classical
formula
relating
momentum
to
velocity
p
but
that
if
someone
wanted
to
do
that
he
would
have
to
use
a
particle
mass
m
that
changes
with
speed
m
v
m
v
c
in
this
case
we
can
say
that
e
mc
is
also
true
for
moving
particles


the
general
theory
of
relativity
general
relativity
the
general
theory
of
relativity
was
published
in
ten
years
after
the
special
theory
of
relativity
was
created


einstein
general
theory
of
relativity
uses
the
idea
of
spacetime


spacetime
is
the
fact
that
we
have
a
universe
having
three
spatial
space
dimensions
and
one
temporal
time
dimension


any
physical
event
happens
at
some
place
inside
these
three
space
dimensions
and
at
some
moment
in
time


according
to
the
general
theory
of
relativity
any
mass
causes
spacetime
to
curve
and
any
other
mass
follows
these
curves


bigger
mass
causes
more
curving


this
was
a
new
way
to
explain
gravitation
gravity


general
relativity
explains
gravitational
which
is
light
bending
when
it
comes
near
a
massive
object


this
explanation
was
proven
correct
during
a
solar
eclipse
when
the
sun
bending
of
starlight
from
distant
stars
could
be
measured
because
of
the
darkness
of
the
eclipse


general
relativity
also
set
the
stage
for
cosmology
theories
of
the
structure
of
our
universe
at
large
distances
and
over
long
times


einstein
thought
that
the
universe
may
curve
a
<collocation>little bit</collocation>
in
both
space
and
time
so
that
the
universe
always
had
existed
and
always
will
exist
and
so
that
if
an
object
moved
through
the
universe
without
bumping
into
anything
it
would
return
to
its
starting
place
from
the
other
direction
after
a
very
long
time


he
even
changed
his
equations
to
include
a
cosmological
constant
in
order
to
allow
a
mathematical
model
of
an
unchanging
universe


the
general
theory
of
relativity
also
allows
the
universe
to
spread
out
grow
larger
and
less
dense
forever
and
most
scientists
think
that
astronomy
has
proved
that
this
is
what
happens


when
einstein
realized
that
good
models
of
the
universe
were
possible
even
without
the
cosmological
constant
he
called
his
use
of
the
cosmological
constant
his
<collocation>biggest blunder</collocation>
and
that
constant
is
often
left
out
of
the
theory


however
many
scientists
now
believe
that
the
cosmological
constant
is
needed
to
fit
in
all
that
we
now
know
about
the
universe


a
popular
theory
of
cosmology
is
called
the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>


according
to
the
<collocation>big bang</collocation>
theory
the
universe
was
formed
billion
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
in
what
is
called
a
gravitational
singularity


this
singularity
was
small
dense
and
very
hot


according
to
this
theory
all
of
the
matter
that
we
know
today
came
out
of
this
point


einstein
himself
did
not
have
the
idea
of
a
black
hole
but
later
scientists
used
this
name
for
an
object
in
the
universe
that
<collocation>bends spacetime</collocation>
so
much
that
not
even
light
can
escape
it


they
think
that
these
objects
are
formed
when
giant
stars
at
least
three
times
the
size
of
our
sun
die


this
event
can
follow
what
is
called
a
supernova


the
formation
of
black
holes
may
be
a
major
source
of
<collocation>gravitational waves</collocation>
so
the
search
for
proof
of
<collocation>gravitational waves</collocation>
has
become
an
important
scientific
pursuit


beliefs
many
scientists
only
care
about
their
work
but
einstein
also
spoke
and
wrote
often
about
politics
and
world
peace


he
liked
the
ideas
of
socialism
and
of
having
only
one
government
for
the
whole
world


he
also
worked
for
zionism
the
effort
to
try
to
create
the
new
country
of
israel


einstein
family
was
jewish
but
einstein
never
practiced
this
religion
seriously


he
liked
the
ideas
of
the
jewish
philosopher
and
also
thought
that
buddhism
was
a
good
religion


proof
date
february
even
though
einstein
thought
of
many
ideas
that
helped
scientists
understand
the
world
much
better
he
disagreed
with
some
scientific
theories
that
other
scientists
liked


the
theory
of
<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
discusses
things
that
can
happen
only
with
certain
probabilities
which
can
not
be
predicted
with
better
precision
no
matter
how
much
information
we
might
have


this
<collocation>theoretical pursuit</collocation>
is
different
from
statistical
mechanics
in
which
einstein
did
important
work


einstein
did
not
like
the
part
of
<collocation>quantum theory</collocation>
that
denied
anything
more
than
the
probability
that
something
would
be
found
to
be
true
of
something
when
it
was
actually
measured
he
thought
that
it
should
be
possible
to
predict
anything
if
we
had
the
correct
theory
and
enough
information


he
once
said
i
do
not
believe
that
god
plays
dice
with
the
universe


because
einstein
helped
science
so
much
his
name
is
now
used
for
several
different
things


a
unit
used
in
was
named
for
him


it
is
equal
to
number
multiplied
by
the
energy
of
one
photon
of
light


the
<collocation>chemical element</collocation>
einsteinium
is
named
after
the
scientist
as
well


in
slang
we
sometimes
call
a
very
smart
person
an
einstein


criticism
most
scientists
think
that
einstein
theories
of
special
and
general
relativity
work
very
well
and
they
use
those
ideas
and
formulas
in
their
own
work


einstein
could
not
agree
that
phenomena
in
<collocation>quantum mechanics</collocation>
can
happen
out
of
pure
chance


he
believed
that
all
natural
have
explanations
that
do
not
include
pure
chance


he
spent
much
of
his
later
life
trying
to
find
a
<collocation>unified field</collocation>
theory
that
would
include
his
general
relativity
theory
maxwell
theory
of
electromagnetism
and
perhaps
a
better
<collocation>quantum theory</collocation>


most
scientists
do
not
think
that
he
succeeded
in
that
attempt


although
most
scientists
greatly
value
einstein
scientific
work
there
has
been
some
strong
criticism
of
einstein
from
other
people


a
group
in
germany
called
wrote
a
whole
encyclopedia
that
claims
to
refute
einstein
theory
of
relativity
and
they
list
about
works
since


fact
date
february
some
people
have
said
that
space
and
time
are
categories
of
perception
not
things
and
are
not
joined
together

currency
is
the
unit
of
money
used
by
the
people
of
a
country
or
union
for
buying
and
selling
goods
and
services


<collocation>certain currencies</collocation>
are
said
to
be
pegged
or
fixed
to
something
usually
another
currency


a
fixed
or
pegged
currency
is
one
that
has
a
constant
value
compared
to
what
it
is
pegged
to


for
example
the
cape
is
pegged
to
the
euro


if
the
value
of
the
euro
goes
up
compared
to
another
form
of
currency
the
value
of
the
also
goes
up
compared
to
that
same
currency


many
countries
have
used
systems
where
their
money
was
pegged
to
something
other
than
currency
for
example
gold


when
they
do
this
as
the
value
of
gold
increases
so
does
the
value
of
their
money


doing
this
is
commonly
called
using
the
gold
standard


most
countries
stopped
using
the
gold
standard
in
the

a
radio
telescope
is
like
a
huge
satellite
dish


an
ordinary
telescope
allows
people
to
see
light
from
distant
objects


stars
shine
and
the
light
can
be
seen
with
a
telescope
but
they
also
give
off
radio
waves


scientists
with
radio
telescopes
receive
these
radio
waves
and
use
computers
to
learn
about
the
stars


other
things
like
black
holes
also
give
off
radio
waves
and
radio
telescopes
are
useful
for
learning
about
them
too


the
dish
is
sometimes
constructed
of
a
conductive
<collocation>wire mesh</collocation>
whose
openings
are
smaller
than
a
wavelength


the
information
received
by
several
radio
telescopes
in
different
places
can
be
combined


this
gives
similar
results
to
having
a
single
dish
as
big
as
the
distance
between
the
telescopes
so
even
very
faint
signals
can
be
received


scientists
are
also
trying
to
do
this
with
ordinary
telescopes


the
radio
telescope
at
the
observatory
new
south
wales
was
used
by
nasa
to
receive

a
light
year
symbol
ly
is
the
distance
that
light
travels
in
empty
space
in
one
year


since
the
speed
of
light
is
about
km
per
second
about
miles
per
second
then
a
light
year
is
about
trillion
kilometers
about
trillion
miles


a
light
year
is
not
a
length
of
time


the
light
year
is
used
in
astronomy
because
the
universe
is
huge


space
objects
such
as
stars
and
galaxies
may
be
hundreds
thousands
or
millions
of
light
years
away


example
think
of
a
star
at
a
distance
of
light
years
from
us
on
earth


light
leaves
the
star
and
takes
years
to
get
to
us


when
we
see
the
star
light
we
are
seeing
that
star
