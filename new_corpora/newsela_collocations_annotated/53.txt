japanese
names
here
are
some
things
that
are
often
found
in
japanese
names
today


in
the
past
people
went
by
different
rules


number
of
parts
of
a
name
japanese
names
have
two
parts


one
is
the
family
name
and
the
other
is
the
given
name


suzuki
is
a
name
of
a
japanese
person


suzuki
is
the
family
name
and
is
the
first
name


in
the
japanese
language
the
family
name
comes
first
and
the
given
name
comes
second


it
is
like
writing
smith
john
instead
of
john
smith


only
some
members
of
the
royal
family
do
not
have
a
family
name


relations
with
names
of
parents
and
other
relatives
a
<collocation>newborn baby</collocation>
gets
a
family
name
from
their
parents


the
parents
have
the
same
family
name


so
a
son
of
ono
female
and
ono
ken
male
is
ono
something


the
family
name
ono
is
mostly
shared
by
the
paternal
male
part
of
the
family


so
ono
ken
parents
have
the
family
name
ono
but
ono
parents
probably
do
not


name
changes
names
of
people
change
when

divorce


it
is
a
custom
in
many
parts
of
the
world
that
women
change
their
family
name
to
that
of
their
new
