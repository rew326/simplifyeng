the
tree
of
life
showing
the
three
domains
of
life
on
earth


evolution
is
the
process
of
change
in
all
forms
of
life
over
generations


this
process
is
how
biologists
explain
how
living
things
changed
over
a
long
time
and
how
they
have
come
to
be
the
way
they
are


the
earth
has
been
around
for
a
very
long
time


by
doing
research
on
the
layers
of
rock
we
can
find
out
about
its
past


that
kind
of
research
is
called
historical
geology


we
know
that
living
things
have
changed
over
time
because
we
can
see
their
remains
in
the
rocks


these
remains
are
called
fossils


so
we
know
that
the
animals
and
plants
of
today
are
different
from
those
of
<collocation>long ago</collocation>


and
the
further
we
go
back
the
more
different
the
fossils
are


how
has
this
come
about


evolution
has
taken
place


that
evolution
has
taken
place
is
a
fact
because
it
is
overwhelmingly
supported
by
many
lines
of
evidence


at
the
same
time
evolutionary
questions
are
still
being
actively
researched
by
biologists


comparison
of
sequences
allows
organisms
to
be
grouped
by
how
similar
their
sequences
are


in
an
analysis
compared
sequences
to
<collocation>phylogenetic trees</collocation>
and
supported
the
idea
of
common
descent


there
is
now
strong
quantitative
support
by
a
formal
test
for
the
unity
of
life


the
theory
of
evolution
is
the
basis
of
modern
biology


nothing
in
biology
makes
sense
except
in
the
light
of
evolution

evidence
for
evolution
the
evidence
for
evolution
is
given
in
a
number
of
books


some
of
this
evidence
is
discussed
here


fossils
show
that
change
has
occurred
the
realization
that
some
rocks
contain
fossils
was
a
landmark
in
natural
history


there
are
three
parts
to
this
story
realizing
that
things
in
rocks
which
looked
organic
actually
were
the
altered
remains
of
living
things


this
was
settled
in
the
and
centuries
by
steno
robert
and
others


realizing
that
many
fossils
represented
species
which
do
not
exist
today


it
was
the
<collocation>comparative anatomist</collocation>
who
proved
that
extinction
occurred
and
that
different
strata
contained
different
fossils


realizing
that
early
fossils
were
simpler
organisms
than
later
fossils


also
the
later
the
rocks
the
more
like
the
present
day
are
the
fossils


quotation
the
most
<collocation>convincing evidence</collocation>
for
the
occurrence
of
evolution
is
the
discovery
of
extinct
organisms
in
older
geological
strata
the
older
the
strata
are
the
more
different
the
fossil
will
be
from
living
representatives
that
is
to
be
expected
if
the
fauna
and
flora
of
the
earlier
strata
had
gradually
evolved
into
their
descendants


evolution
of
horses
the
ancestors
of
our
horses
lived
in
forests


the
evolution
of
the
horse
family
is
a
good
example
of
the
way
that
evolution
works


the
oldest
fossil
of
a
horse
is
about
million
years
old


it
was
a
small
animal
with
five
toes
on
the
front
feet
and
four
on
the
<collocation>hind feet</collocation>


at
that
time
there
were
more
forests
in
the
world
than
today


this
horse
lived
in
woodland
eating
leaves
nuts
and
fruit
with
its
simple
teeth


it
was
only
about
as
big
as
a
fox


about
million
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
the
world
started
to
become
cooler
and
drier


forests
shrank
grassland
expanded
and
horses
changed


they
ate
grass
they
grew
larger
and
they
ran
faster
because
they
had
to
escape
faster
predators


because
grass
wears
teeth
out
horses
with
teeth
had
an
advantage


for
most
of
this
long
period
of
time
there
were
a
number
of
horse
types
genera


now
however
only
one
genus
exists
the
modern
horse


it
has
teeth
which
grow
all
its
life
hooves
on
single
toes
great
long
legs
for
running
and
the
animal
is
big
and
strong
enough
to
survive
in
the
open
plain


horses
lived
in
western
canada
until
<collocation>years ago</collocation>
but
all
horses
in
north
america
became
extinct
about
<collocation>years ago</collocation>


the
causes
of
this
extinction
are
not
yet
clear


<collocation>climate change</collocation>
and
over
hunting
by
humans
are
suggested


so
scientists
can
see
that
changes
have
happened


they
have
happened
slowly
over
a
long
time


how
these
changes
have
come
about
is
explained
by
the
theory
of
evolution


<collocation>geographical distribution</collocation>


the
are
a
family
of
<collocation>flowering plants</collocation>
entirely
limited
to
the
southern
continents


this
is
a
topic
which
fascinated
both
charles
darwin
and
<collocation>alfred russel</collocation>


when
new
species
occur
usually
by
the
splitting
of
older
species
this
takes
place
in
one
place
in
the
world


once
it
is
established
a
new
species
may
spread
to
some
places
and
not
others


has
been
separated
from
other
continents
for
many
millions
of
years


in
the
main
part
of
the
continent
australia
of
mammals
of
reptiles
of
fish
and
insects
and
of
amphibians
are
endemic


its
native
mammals
are
mostly
marsupials
like
kangaroos
and


by
contrast
marsupials
are
today
totally
absent
from
africa
and
form
a
small
portion
of
the
mammalian
fauna
of
south
america
where
opossums
shrew
opossums
and
the
del
monte
occur
see
the
great
american
interchange


the
only
living
representatives
of
primitive
mammals
are
the
and
the
platypus


they
are
only
found
in
which
includes
new
guinea
and
kangaroo
island


these
are
totally
absent
in
the
rest
of
the
world


on
the
other
hand
australia
is
missing
many
groups
of
placental
mammals
that
are
common
on
other
continents
carnivora
shrews
squirrels
although
it
does
have
<collocation>indigenous bats</collocation>
and
rodents
which
arrived
later


the
evolutionary
story
is
that
placental
mammals
evolved
in
eurasia
and
wiped
out
the
marsupials
and
wherever
they
spread


they
never
got
to
until
more
recently


that
is
the
simple
reason
why
australia
has
most
of
the
world
marsupials
and
all
the
world

drosophila

about
hawaiian
species
are
known


genetic
evidence
shows
that
all
the
native
species
in
i
have
descended
from
a
single
ancestral
species
that
colonized
the
islands
about
million
<collocation>years ago</collocation>


the
<collocation>subsequent adaptive</collocation>
radiation
was
spurred
by
a
lack
of
competition
and
a
wide
variety
of
vacant


although
it
would
be
possible
for
a
single
pregnant
female
to
colonise
an
island
it
is
more
likely
to
have
been
a
group
from
the
same

of

pole
during
the


common
descent
when
biologists
look
at
living
things
they
see
that
animals
and
plants
belong
to
groups
which
have
something
in
common


charles
darwin
explained
that
this
followed
naturally
if
we
admit
the
common
parentage
of
allied
forms
together
with
their
modification
through
variation
and
natural
selection


for
example
all
insects
are
related


they
share
a
basic
body
plan
whose
development
is
controlled
by
<collocation>master regulatory</collocation>
genes


they
have
six
legs
they
have
hard
parts
on
the
outside
of
the
body
an
exoskeleton
they
have
eyes
formed
of
many
separate
chambers
and
so
on


biologists
explain
this
with
evolution


all
insects
are
the
descendants
of
a
group
of
animals
who
lived
a
long
time
ago


they
still
keep
the
basic
plan
six
legs
and
so
on
but
the
details
change


they
look
different
now
because
they
changed
in
different
ways
this
is
evolution


it
was
darwin
who
first
suggested
that
all
life
on
earth
had
a
single
origin
and
from
that
beginning
endless
forms
most
beautiful
and
most
wonderful
have
been
and
are
being
evolved


evidence
from
<collocation>molecular biology</collocation>
in
recent
years
has
supported
the
idea
that
all
life
is
related
by
common
descent


<collocation>vestigial structures</collocation>
strong
evidence
for
common
descent
comes
from
<collocation>vestigial structures</collocation>


the
useless
wings
of
flightless
beetles
are
sealed
under
fused
wing
covers


this
can
be
simply
explained
by
their
descent
from
<collocation>ancestral beetles</collocation>
which
had
wings
that
worked


rudimentary
body
parts
those
that
are
smaller
and
simpler
in
structure
than
corresponding
parts
in
ancestral
species
are
called
<collocation>vestigial organs</collocation>


those
organs
are
functional
in
the
ancestral
species
but
are
now
either
nonfunctional
or
to
a
new
function


examples
are
the
pelvic
girdles
of
whales
<collocation>hind wings</collocation>
of
flies
wings
of
<collocation>flightless birds</collocation>
and
the
leaves
of
some
cactus
and
parasitic
plants
dodder


however
<collocation>vestigial structures</collocation>
may
have
their
original
function
replaced
with
another


for
example
the
in
flies
help
balance
the
insect
while
in
flight
and
the
wings
of
ostriches
are
used
in
<collocation>mating rituals</collocation>
and
in
aggressive
display


the
ear
in
mammals
are
former
bones
of
the
<collocation>lower jaw</collocation>


rudimentary
organs
plainly
declare
their
origin
and
meaning


rudimentary
organs
are
the
record
of
a
former
state
of
things
and
have
been
retained
solely
though
the
powers
of
inheritance
far
from
being
a
difficulty
as
they
assuredly
do
on
the
old
doctrine
of
creation
might
even
have
been
anticipated
in
accordance
with
the
views
here
explained


in
robert
published
a
book
on
human
anatomy
and
its
relevance
to
man
evolutionary
history


this
book
contained
a
list
of
human
organs
that
he
considered
vestigial


this
list
included
examples
such
as
the
appendix
and
the
<collocation>molar teeth</collocation>
wisdom
teeth


the
strong
grip
of
a
baby
is
another
example


it
is
a
vestigial
reflex
a
remnant
of
the
past
when
babies
clung
to
their
mothers
hair
as
the
mothers
swung
through
the
trees


this
is
borne
out
by
the
babies
feet
which
curl
up
when
it
is
sitting
down
<collocation>primate babies</collocation>
grip
with
the
feet
as
well


all
primates
except
modern
man
have
thick
body
hair
to
which
an
infant
can
cling
unlike
modern
humans


the
grasp
reflex
allows
the
mother
to
escape
danger
by
climbing
a
tree
using
both
hands
and
feet


<collocation>vestigial organs</collocation>
often
have
some
selection
against
them


the
original
organs
took
resources
sometimes
huge
resources


if
they
no
longer
have
a
function
reducing
their
size
improves
fitness


and
there
is
direct
evidence
of
selection


some
cave
crustacea
reproduce
more
successfully
with
smaller
eyes
than
do
those
with
larger
eyes


this
may
be
because
the
<collocation>nervous tissue</collocation>
dealing
with
sight
now
becomes
available
to
handle
other
sensory
input


embryology
from
the
eighteenth
century
it
was
known
that
embryos
of
different
species
were
much
more
similar
than
the
adults


in
particular
some
parts
of
embryos
reflect
their
evolutionary
past


for
example
the
embryos
of
land
vertebrates
develop
gill
slits
like
fish
embryos


of
course
this
is
only
a
temporary
stage
which
gives
rise
to
many
structures
in
the
neck
of
reptiles
birds
and
mammals


the
slits
are
part
of
a
complicated
system
of
development
that
is
why
they
persisted


another
example
are
the
<collocation>embryonic teeth</collocation>
of
<collocation>baleen whales</collocation>


they
are
later
lost


the
<collocation>baleen filter</collocation>
is
developed
from
different
tissue
called
keratin


early
<collocation>fossil baleen</collocation>
whales
did
actually
have
teeth
as
well
as
the
baleen


a
good
example
is
the
barnacle


it
took
many
centuries
before
natural
historians
discovered
that
barnacles
were
crustacea


their
adults
look
so
unlike
other
crustacea
but
their
larvae
are
very
similar
to
those
of
other
crustacea

charles
darwin
lived
in
a
world
where
<collocation>animal husbandry</collocation>
and
domesticated
crops
were
vitally
important


in
both
cases
farmers
selected
for
breeding
individuals
with
special
properties
and
prevented
the
breeding
of
individuals
with
less
<collocation>desirable characteristics</collocation>


the
eighteenth
and
early
<collocation>nineteenth century</collocation>
saw
a
growth
in
scientific
agriculture
and
artificial
breeding
was
part
of
this


darwin
discussed
<collocation>artificial selection</collocation>
as
a
model
for
natural
selection
in
the
first
edition
of
his
work
on
the
origin
of
species
in
chapter
iv
natural
selection
slow
though
the
process
of
selection
may
be
if
feeble
man
can
do
much
by
his
powers
of
<collocation>artificial selection</collocation>
i
can
see
no
limit
to
the
amount
of
change
which
may
be
effected
in
the
long
course
of

by

power
of
selection


rye
is
a
now
a
crop


originally
it
was
a
mimetic
weed
of
wheat
showed
that
rye
originally
a
weed
came
to
be
a
crop
plant
by
unintentional
selection


rye
is
a
tougher
plant
than
wheat
it
survives
in
harsher
conditions


having
become
a
crop
like
the
wheat
rye
was
able
to
become
a
crop
plant
in
harsh
areas
such
as
hills
and
mountains


there
is
no
real
difference
in
the
genetic
processes
underlying
artificial
and
natural
selection
and
the
concept
of
<collocation>artificial selection</collocation>
was
used
by
charles
darwin
as
an
illustration
of
the
wider
process
of
natural
selection


there
are
practical
differences


experimental
studies
of
<collocation>artificial selection</collocation>
show
that
the
rate
of
evolution
in
selection
experiments
is
at
least
two
orders
of
magnitude
that
is
times
greater
than
any
rate
seen
in
nature
or
the
fossil
record


artificial
new
species
some
have
thought
that
<collocation>artificial selection</collocation>
could
not
produce
new
species


it
now
seems
that
it
can


new
species
have
been
created
by
domesticated
<collocation>animal husbandry</collocation>
but
the
details
are
not
known
or
not
clear


for
example
domestic
sheep
were
created
by
and
no
longer
produce
viable
offspring
with
one
species
from
which
they
are
descended


domestic
cattle
on
the
other
hand
can
be
considered
the
same
species
as
several
varieties
of
wild
ox
yak
as
they
readily
produce
fertile
offspring
with
them


the
new
species
came
from
laboratory
experiments
in
the
late


william
rice
and
salt
bred
fruit
flies
drosophila
using
a
maze
with
three
different
choices
of
habitat
such
as
and


each
generation
was
put
into
the
maze
and
the
groups
of
flies
that
came
out
of
two
of
the
eight
exits
were
set
apart
to
breed
with
each
other
in
their
respective
groups


after
generations
the
two
groups
and
their
offspring
were
isolated
reproductively
because
of
their
strong
habitat
preferences
they
mated
only
within
the
areas
they
preferred
and
so
did
not
mate
with
flies
that
preferred
the
other
areas


<collocation>diane dodd</collocation>
was
also
able
to
show
how
<collocation>reproductive isolation</collocation>
can
develop
from
mating
preferences
in
drosophila
fruit
flies
after
only
eight
generations
using
different
food
types
starch
and


dodd
experiment
has
been
easy
for
others
to
repeat


it
has
also
been
done
with
other
fruit
flies
and
foods


observable
changes
some
biologists
say
that
evolution
has
happened
when
a
trait
that
is
caused
by
genetics
becomes
more
or
less
common
in
a
group
of
organisms


others
call
it
evolution
when
new
species
appear


changes
can
happen
quickly
in
the
smaller
simpler
organisms


for
example
many
bacteria
that
cause
disease
can
no
longer
be
killed
with
some
of
the
antibiotic
medicines


these
medicines
have
only
been
in
use
about
eighty
years
and
at
first
worked
extremely
well


the
bacteria
have
evolved
so
that
they
are
no
longer
affected
by
antibiotics
anymore


the
drugs
killed
off
all
the
bacteria
except
a
few
which
had
some
resistance


these
few
resistant
bacteria
produced
the
next
generation


the
<collocation>colorado beetle</collocation>
is
famous
for
its
ability
to
resist
pesticides


over
the
last
years
it
has
become
resistant
to
chemical
compounds
used
in
insecticides
including
cyanide


this
is
natural
selection
speeded
up
by
the
artificial
conditions


however
not
every
population
is
resistant
to
every
chemical


the
populations
only
become
resistant
to
chemicals
used
in
their
area
