history
of
zero
the
idea
of
zero
was
first
thought
about
in
babylon
india
and
in
central
america
at
different
times


some
places
and
countries
did
not
know
about
a
zero
which
may
have
made
it
harder
for
those
people
to
do
mathematics


over
hundreds
of
years
the
idea
of
zero
was
passed
from
country
to
country


from
india
and
babylon
to
other
places
like
greece
persia
and
the
arab
parts
of
the
world


the
europeans
learned
about
zero
from
the
arabs


the
place
of
zero
as
a
number
zero
is
almost
never
used
as
a
place
number
number


this
means
that
it
is
not
used
like
or
to
indicate
the
order
or
place
of
something
like
or


an
exception
to
this
is
seen
in
many
programming
languages


some
other
things
about
zero
the
number
zero
is
a
whole
number


the
number
zero
is
not
a
positive
number


the
number
zero
is
not
a
negative
number
either


the
number
zero
is
a
neutral
number


any
number
divided
by
itself
equals
one
except
if
that
number
is
zero


in
symbols
not
a
number


in
time
zero
means
now


for
example
when
a
person
is
counting
down
the
time
to
the
start
of
something
such
as
a
foot
race
or
when
a
rocket
takes
off
the
count
is
three
two
one
zero
or
go


zero
is
the
exact
time
of
the
start
of
the
race
or
when
the
rocket
takes
off
into
the
sky


as
a
number
is
the
integer
that
precedes
the
positive
and
follows


in
most
if
not
all
numerical
systems
was
identified
before
the
idea
of
negative
integers
was
accepted


it
means
courageous
one
in
hieroglyphics


zero
is
a
number
which
means
an
amount
of
null
size
that
is
if
the
number
of
your
brothers
is
zero
that
means
the
same
thing
as
having
no
brothers
and
if
something
has
a
weight
of
zero
it
has
no
weight


if
the
difference
between
the
numbers
of
pieces
in
two
piles
is
zero
it
means
the
two
piles
have
an
equal
number
of
pieces


before
counting
starts
the
result
can
be
assumed
to
be
zero
that
is
the
number
of
items
counted
before
you
count
the
first
item
and
counting
the
first
item
brings
the
result
to
one


and
if
there
are
no
items
to
be
counted
zero
remains
the
final
result


while
mathematicians
all
accept
zero
as
a
number
some
would
say
that
zero
is
not
a
number
arguing
that
one
can
not
have
zero
of
something


others
say
that
if
one
has
a
bank
balance
of
zero
one
has
a
specific
quantity
of
money
in
that
account
namely
none


it
is
that
latter
view
which
is
accepted
by
mathematicians
and
most
others


normally
speaking
there
was
no
year
zero
between
and
ad


more
exactly
almost
all
historians
leave
out
the
year
zero
from
the
gregorian
and
julian
calendars
that
is
from
the
normal
calendar
used
in
countries
but
astronomers
include
it
in
these
same
calendars


however
the
phrase
year
zero
may
be
used
to
describe
any
event
considered
so
important
that
someone
might
want
to
start
counting
years
all
over
again
from
zero


as
a
numeral
the
modern
numeral
is
normally
written
as
a
circle
or
rounded
rectangle


in
fonts
with
text
figures
is
usually
the
same
height
as
a
lowercase
on
the
displays
of
calculators
watches
is
usually
written
with
six
line
segments
though
on
some
historical
<collocation>calculator models</collocation>
it
was
written
with
four
line
segments


the
is
not
common


the
number
zero
as
in
the
zero
brothers
example
above
is
not
the
same
as
the
numeral
or
digit
zero
used
in
numeral
systems
using
positional
notation


successive
positions
of
digits
have
higher
values
so
the
digit
zero
is
used
to
skip
a
position
and
give
appropriate
value
to
the
preceding
and
following
digits


a
zero
digit
is
not
always
necessary
in
a
different
positional
number
system


something
called
is
a
possible
example
of
a
system
without
zeroes


the
numerical
digit
zero
zero
is
also
used
as
a
numerical
digit
used
to
represent
that
number
in
numerals


it
is
used
to
hold
the
place
of
that
digit
because
correct
placing
of
digits
affects
a
numeral
value


examples
in
the
numeral
which
stands
for
one
times
ten
and
zero
units
or
ones


in
the
numeral
which
stands
for
one
times
a
hundred
plus
zero
tens
plus
zero
units


telling
zero
and
the
letter
o
apart
the
number
and
the
letter
o
are
both
round
so
what
is
the
difference


the
difference
is
important
on
a
computer


for
one
thing
a
computer
will
not
do
arithmetic
with
the
letter
o
because
it
does
not
know
that
it
should
have
been
a
zero


the
zero
and
circular
letter
o
came
into
use
together
on
modern
character
displays


the
zero
with
a
dot
in
the
center
seems
to
have
begun
as
a
choice
on
ibm
controllers
this
has
the
problem
that
it
looks
like
the
greek
letter
theta


the
slashed
zero
looking
like
the
letter
o
with
a
diagonal
line
drawn
inside
it
is
used
in
graphic
sets
that
came
from
the
default
on
the
teletype


this
format
causes
problems
because
it
looks
like
the
symbol
representing
the
empty
set
as
well
as
for
certain
scandinavian
languages
which
use
as
a
letter


the
rule
which
has
the
letter
o
with
a
slash
and
the
zero
without
was
used
at
ibm
and
a
few
other
early
mainframe
makers
this
is
even
more
of
a
problem
for
scandinavians
because
it
looks
like
two
of
their
letters
at
the
same
time


some
computers
display
a
zero
with
a
backwards
slash


and
yet
another
convention
common
on
early
line
printers
left
zero
without
any
extra
dots
or
slashes
but
added
a
tail
or
hook
to
the
letter
o
so
that
it
resembled
an
inverted
q
or
cursive
capital
letter
a
german
<collocation>licence plate</collocation>
showing
zeroes
the
letters
used
on
some
european
number
plates
for
cars
make
the
two
symbols
look
different


this
is
done
by
making
the
zero
rather
and
the
o
more
circular
but
most
of
all
by
cutting
open
the
zero
on
the
upper
right
side
so
the
circle
is
not
closed
any
more
as
in
german
plates


the
style
of
letters
chosen
is
called
fe
meaning
script
which
is
harder
to
falsify


but
those
used
in
the
<collocation>united kingdom</collocation>
do
not
make
the
letter
o
and
the
number
look
different
from
each
other
because
there
can
never
be
any
mistake
if
the
letters
are
correctly
spaced


in
paper
writing
you
do
not
have
to
make
the
and
o
look
different
at
all


or
you
may
add
a
slash
across
the
zero
in
order
to
show
the
difference
although
this
sometimes
causes
mistakes
in
the
number


zeroes
of
a
function
functions
are
explained
in
the
function
mathematics
article


if
the
function
f
x
then
x
is
called
a
zero
of
the
function
f


for
example
if
the
function
f
x
is
x
then
the
zeroes
of
the
function
are
and
because
f
and
f


zeroes
of
a
function
are
used
because
they
are
another
way
to
talk
about
solving
an
equation
which
is
a
main
goal
in
algebra


if
we
want
to
solve
an
equation
like
x
then
we
can
subtract
the
side
of
the
equation
from
both
sides
in
this
case


whatever
we
get
on
the
side
in
this
case
x
can
be
called
a
function
f
x


the
side
has
to
be
zero
because
we
subtracted
it
from
itself


so
f
x


finding
the
zeroes
of
this
function
is
the
same
as
solving
this
equation


in
the
paragraph
before
the
zeroes
of
this
function
are
and
so
they
are
the
solutions
of
this
equation


we
got
this
equation
by
subtracting
the
same
thing
from
both
sides
so
we
also
have
solutions
to
the
equation
we
started
with
in
this
case
x


so
if
we
could
find
zeroes
of
functions
we
could
solve
any
equation

where
zinc
is
found
five
isotopes
of
zinc
are
found
in
nature


zn
is
the
most
common
isotope
with
of
naturally
occurring
zinc


this
isotope
has
a
of
years


this
is
so
long
that
its
radioactivity
can
be
ignored


similarly
chem
zn
with
a
half
life
of
years
is
usually
considered
to
not
be
radioactive


the
other
isotopes
found
in
nature
are

a
common
zinc
ore
zinc
is
not
found
as
a
metal
in
the
earth
crust


zinc
is
only
found
as
zinc
compounds


a
mineral
that
is
made
of
zinc
sulfide
is
a
main
ore
of
zinc


very
little
zinc
is
in
the
ocean


zinc
ore
is
normally
found
with
copper
and
lead
ores


there
are
some
other
<collocation>zinc ores</collocation>
such
as
zinc
carbonate
and
a
zinc
<collocation>silicate mineral</collocation>


they
are
less
common


preparation
the
zinc
sulfide
is
concentrated
by
flotation


there
is
a
detergent
that
collects
the
zinc
sulfide


the
impurities
sink
to
the
bottom
and
are
removed


then
the
zinc
sulfide
is
heated
in
air
to
make
<collocation>zinc oxide</collocation>
and
<collocation>sulfur dioxide</collocation>


o
so
the
<collocation>sulfur dioxide</collocation>
is
oxidized
to
sulfur


so
o
so
the
sulfur
reacts
with
the
<collocation>zinc oxide</collocation>
to
make
<collocation>zinc sulfate</collocation>


this
makes
a
soluble
form
of
zinc
which
can
be
processed
more


so
the
<collocation>zinc sulfate</collocation>
is
purified
and


this
electrolysis
makes
oxygen
zinc
and
sulfuric
acid


this
makes
a
pure
zinc
that
is
known
as
or
special
high
grade


h
o
zn
h
so
o
the
sulfuric
acid
is
reused
in
place
of
the
sulfur
to
leach
more
<collocation>zinc oxide</collocation>


<collocation>zinc oxide</collocation>
can
also
be
reduced
by
carbon
to
zinc
metal
and
<collocation>carbon dioxide</collocation>
at
high
temperatures


this
is
a
blast
furnace
process
similar
to
how
iron
is
made


c
zn
co
this
form
of
zinc
is
cheaper
but
is
not
pure


zinc
is
the
fourth
most
common
metal
in
the
world


about
million
tons
are
made
every
year


uses
as
a
metal
a
galvanized
item
common
<collocation>alkaline batteries</collocation>


these
batteries
have
a
zinc
powder
in
the
middle
of
the
battery


zinc
is
used
in
electrical
batteries
