how
people
get
infected
it
is
possible
that
a
person
can
get
infected
with
if
any
body
liquid
with
the
virus
gets
into
their
body


the
body
liquids
that
carry
are
blood
semen
liquid
from
the
vagina
and
breast
milk


the
liquids
can
go
into
the
body
through
injured
skin


the
liquids
can
also
enter
through
the
mouth
eyes
nose
vagina
anus
or
penis


however
though
might
enter
the
body
through
any
of
these
places
when
people
get
by
having
sex
the
virus
usually
enters
the
body
through
the
vagina
or
anus


there
are
some
common
ways
to
get
a
person
with
can
give
a
sexual
partner
the
virus
if
they
have
<collocation>unprotected sex</collocation>


that
means
having
<collocation>sexual intercourse</collocation>
without
a
condom


a
person
can
get
if
he
or
she
uses
the
same
needle
as
a
person
with
to
inject
drugs
or
get
a
tattoo


a
person
may
get
if
he
or
she
is
stuck
by
a
needle
that
was
used
on
a
patient
with


babies
can
get
the
virus
from
their
mothers
when
they
are
born
or
when
they
are
breastfeeding


a
baby
may
be
protected
from
getting
this
way
if
their
mother
takes
certain
medications
while
she
is
pregnant


<collocation>blood transfusions</collocation>
using
infected
blood
products
was
a
common
cause
of


the
blood
had
been
taken
from
people
with
infections


now
in
the
developed
world
screening
of
blood
products
for
has
mostly
stopped
this
happening


however
people
may
still
get
from
<collocation>blood transfusions</collocation>
in
countries
if
blood
is
not
screened
carefully


a
person
can
not
get
infected
with
from
touching
like
a
hug
or
handshake
or
touching
someone
else
saliva


a
person
can
not
get

an

<collocation>treatment drug</collocation>
treatment
causes
a
person
to
become
more
prone
to
illness
so
infected
people
need
treatment
options


however
there
is
no
cure
for


to
help
ease
negative
symptoms
drugs
called
therapy
art
are
available


this
treatment
is
also
called
high
active
therapy


treatment
begins
with
one
reverse
inhibitor
and
two
nucleoside
<collocation>analog reverse</collocation>
inhibitors


these
drugs
slow
the
progression
of
the
virus
in
the
body


usually
these
treatments
consist
of
a
combination
of
three
or
more
drugs
and
each
drug
performs
a
different
job
in
fighting
the
virus


in
general
prevents
the
from
multiplying
and
destroying
cells


cells
are
necessary
to
help
protect
the
body
from
infections
and
cancer


since
the
virus
destroys
cells
it
causes
people
with
to
be
more
prone
to
illness


it
is
recommended
to
start
if
a
person
has
and
has
a
cell
count
of
less
than
or
equal
to


this
number
can
be
determined
by
a
doctor


a
person
age
sex
and
other
infections
determine
which
treatment
he
or
she
should
take


these
medication
regimens
can
help
people
live
longer
healthier
lives
and
can
also
help
prevent
the
from
advancing
to
aids


symptoms
of
acute
infection
general
treatment
there
has
been
controversy
surrounding
when
the
correct
time
to
start
therapy
should
be
after
a
person
discovers
that
he
or
she
has


recently
the
answer
has
been
that
earlier
treatment
is
recommended


this
is
because
first
effective
therapy
can
prevent
deaths


second
therapy
can
prevent
harm
to
a
person
immune
system


third
therapy
can
help
prevent
transmission
of
to
others
and
can
therefore
reduce
prevalence
overall


although
there
are
some
negative
side
effects
of
medications
the
benefits
of
therapy
usually
outweigh
the
negative
effects


effects
of
therapy
patients
on
have
reported
significant
improvements
in
physical
health
emotional
health
<collocation>mental health</collocation>
and
daily
function
compared
to
patients
not
yet
on

most
research
has
occurred
in
developing
countries
and
little
research
has
been
done
on
the
impacts
of
art
on
household
wellbeing


although
can
be
an
effective
means
to
treating
there
can
be
many
negative
side
effects


negative
side
effects
can
vary
by
drug

alternative
therapy
many
people

tried
using
alternative
treatment
methods
known
as

and
alternative
medicine
cam


some
types
of
cam
include
<collocation>stress management</collocation>
natural
health
products
massage
<collocation>therapeutic touch</collocation>
acupuncture
and
homeopathy


<collocation>stress management</collocation>
can
increase
quality
of
life
for
a
person
with


even
with
little
evidence
of
its
effectiveness
many
people
chose
to
try
cam
because
of
the
many
negative
side
effects
associated
with
and
the
few
negative
side
effects
associated
with
cam


some
people
also
try
herbal
medicines
to
treat
but
there
has
been
no
evidence
showing
any
<collocation>positive outcomes</collocation>
with
the
use
of
herbal
remedies


another
type
of
alternative
therapy
for
treating
is


are
vitamins
and
minerals
so
these
supplements
would
be
in
the
form
of
a
general
daily
multivitamin


these
supplements
have
been
proven
to
help
treat
because
can
cause
deficiencies
so
the
supplements
can
help
replenish
these
needed
vitamins
and
minerals


although
the
supplements
may
not
help
ease
all
negative
symptoms
they
offer
some
benefits
and
are
safe
for
patients


supplements
are
also
safe
for
pregnant
women
and
their
children


specifically
vitamin
a
and
zinc
have
shown
positive
health
effects


there
are
no
major
negative
side
effects
of
vitamin
and
<collocation>mineral supplements</collocation>


<collocation>alternative therapies</collocation>
can
help
to
reduce

do
not
cure
