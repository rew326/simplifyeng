DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK, Calif. — The cracking sounds were loud. Under sunny skies, an ankle-deep, frozen lake was breaking apart.

The shallow lake here in Death Valley National Park is normally dry. It is known as "the Racetrack Playa." A playa is an area of flat dried-up land.

Death Valley is the hottest, driest place on Earth. On Dec. 21 of last year, though, the playa was anything but dry.

Cousins Richard Norris and James Norris were observing the scene. Both are scientists. As they watched, a light wind began moving huge sheets of ice across the lake's surface.

## "It's Happening!"

Soon, that ice was ramming into large rocks. Pushed by the ice, the rocks began to move. They slid slowly across the lake's slick, muddy bottom.

"My God, Jim, it's happening," Richard yelled.

James Norris grabbed a camera.

Their photos solved a mystery that had puzzled scientists for a long time: What is it that moves the rocks across the Racetrack Playa?

The rocks that are sprinkled around the playa are big. Some weigh 600 pounds or more.

The proof that the rocks are moving is what they leave behind: trails in the dirt. The trails are deep — but no other tracks are visible.

Different explanations of how the rocks move had been suggested. However, until that day last December, no one had been able to prove anything.

## Ice In The Desert

"I'm amazed," James Norris said. The playa is "a place where rainfall averages 2 inches a year." Yet, "rocks are being shoved around" by ice.

Scientists have been studying the moving rocks since 1948.

One reason the mystery remained is that the rocks only move occasionally. They can stay still for many years until certain things happen.

The first necessary step is rain falling on the playa. Next, temperatures must fall low enough to freeze the water before it evaporates. Then the sun has to come out and thaw the ice. Once the ice breaks into chunks, wind has to move it across the shallow water. Even a light wind is enough to get the ice moving.

The Norrises began trying to solve the mystery in 2011.

Over the next two years, they placed some measuring devices around the playa. The devices would show them whether the rocks moved.

On Dec. 20, the two cousins returned to inspect their devices. "We found the playa covered with ice," Richard Norris recalled. "We also noticed fresh rock trails."

## Rocks Get A Push

The following afternoon, "a light wind kicked up and the ice started cracking," Richard Norris said. Suddenly, everything "unfolded before our eyes."

The cousins later learned that there had been a rare winter storm in late November. It had dropped rain and snow on the playa.

Following that storm, the playa was turned into a shallow lake. The new lake froze overnight when temperatures dropped. On sunny days, the ice began to break into sheets. As light winds sprung up, the ice began to move. Soon, the stones too began to move.

James Norris's photos make everything clear: Large but thin sheets of ice blew into rocks. Pushed by the ice, the rocks slid along the slushy, slippery mud.

The paths of the stones were set by the direction and force of the winds. Once the lake disappeared, those paths would remain as trails.

The Norris cousins are not only scientists themselves. Both are also the sons of famous scientists. Their fathers have passed away.

"Wouldn't our fathers have loved to have known this?" James Norris said about their discovery.
