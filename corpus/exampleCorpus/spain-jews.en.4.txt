SEATTLE, Wash. â€” Doreen Alhadeff says she wants to become a citizen of Spain. It was taken from her family long ago, she said. Now she wants it back.

Jews of Spanish background are called Sephardic, but few live in Spain today. Spain forced them to leave in 1492. Most Jews moved to what is today Turkey. Spain wants to make up for that part of its history. It will now give Sephardic Jews the right to become citizens. They will be allowed to remain citizens of their home countries. This is called dual citizenship.

## A Trip To Spain

Alhadeff belongs to an important Sephardic family in Seattle, Washington. The city has 5,000 Sephardic Jews. In the United States, only New York and Los Angeles have more Sephardic Jews.

Alhadeff grew up hearing her grandparents speak Ladino. Her grandmother used to call her "mi alma." Alhadeff did not think much about it. Then she went to Spain and heard someone in a cafe say it.

"I almost fell out of my chair," said Alhadeff. She found out those were the Spanish words for "my soul." It was one of the things that made her feel closer to Spain.

She lived in Spain and saw how it has preserved Jewish places. Spain today is not the same as in 1492, she said.

## Some Look To Turkey

Still, many Jews do not want to become Spanish. They blame Spain for a sad moment in their history. They also think it is asking them for too much to apply to become a citizen.

Victor Amira was angry. "They kicked us out and now they're making us go through hoops?" he said.

New citizens have to pass a Spanish test. They also have to travel to Spain.

Alhadeff's son, Loren Alhadeff, said he is excited. He hopes the law will build Sephardic pride. He has two young children and a busy job. He has to see how hard it will be before he decides to apply.

Other people have doubts. They think Spain just wants to bring in Jewish money and tourism.

Not all Sephardic Jews feel they have roots in Spain. Isaac Azose has roots in Turkey. He would rather honor Turkey. He said it was "the country that took us in."
