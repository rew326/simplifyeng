WASHINGTON - Lawmakers are arguing about school lunches. They cannot agree on how much money to spend on poor kids' food. They also cannot agree on what type of food should be in school lunches.

Charity Edwards' family is poor. Edwards is separated from her husband and has no job. She has four children. Her two girls are ages 6 and 11. She also has two boys, ages 15 and 17.

Poor children can get free or reduced-price school lunches, but only during the school year. They can't get the lunches while on summer break.

Lawmaker Patty Murray wants poor kids to get money for food during the summer, too. She said many poor children do not get regular meals at that time.

## Let's All Eat Potatoes

Under Murray's plan, Charity Edwards would get $600 to buy food for her children during the summer. That's $150 for each child. Murray said her plan would help 30 million children.

Murray also wants poor kids to get to eat more white potatoes. White potatoes are a big crop in her state, Washington. But other lawmakers say children already eat enough starchy vegetables. They think they should eat healthier vegetables.

Lawmakers must soon decide on spending plans for the Department of Agriculture. That department is in charge of [school lunches](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=school lunch). But agreeing on what to do will be hard.

## Toss In More Fruits And vegetables

Many lawmakers worry that the school lunch program already costs too much. And they fear it will soon cost even more.

Now, schools must offer more fruits and vegetables, whole-wheat products and low-sodium foods. That is because of new rules that are backed by first lady Michelle Obama.

Some people say it's a mistake to make schools offer food that many students do not want to eat. They say more food will be thrown out. They also say fewer students will eat the meals.

"Less kids are buying school lunches," said lawmaker Robert Aderholt of Alabama. He said it was time to "to hit the pause button" on new guidelines.

Aderholt and other lawmakers said schools that cannot afford to serve healthier school lunches should not have to. Meanwhile, the government said schools can serve regular pasta instead of whole-grain pasta for another two years.

## Helping Children To Eat Should Be No-Brainer

School lunches are a controversial topic. In December, lawmaker Jack Kingston of Georgia suggested that schoolchildren could sweep the floors before getting free lunches. Many people loudly disagreed.

Patty Murray said she was ready for questions about the cost of her summer hunger program. But she is expecting support for it from other lawmakers.

Edwards, the mother of four, is hoping lawmakers will support the idea. The extra money would help her feed her children. She said everything is getting more expensive.

"My water bill is $80 a month, my gas bill is $200 a month, my electricity bill is $45 a month," Edwards said.

She is also worried about the rising cost of meat. Last week, she paid more than $20 for ground beef and bacon at the grocery store. Her food stamps do not cover the cost of meals, she said.
