U.S. teen clothing retailers are closing stores. Lots of stores.

For years, teens have hung out at the stores in the malls. They were looking for trendy clothes. Now, retailers such as American Eagle Outfitters, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and Aeropostale don't think they need so many stores.

The stores used to be hot. They set the fashion trends for high schoolers. Now they are trying to change how and where they sell clothes.

Teens today use smartphones to shop. They buy things online just as easily as in stores. So retailers need to help them shop by phone. They also need to sell new styles faster. Their prices have to be what teens will pay.

The retailers may have been slow to act. But they are taking the problem seriously.

## Lots Of Clothes Are Still Being Sold

Brian Tunick is an expert on retail for the banking firm JPMorgan. He said lower-priced chains picked up sales from 2007 to 2013. So did "fast-fashion" retailers like Forever 21, H&amp;M, and Uniqlo. They've done well by selling inexpensive fashion. They also change the clothes they sell frequently.

Many of these retailers are based in other countries. They've now opened lots of stores in the United States.

Meanwhile, the American teen clothing retailers were following the example of some of those international retailers. They opened a lot of stores around the world. Their stores in other countries have done well. Most U.S. retailers plan to open more overseas.

But they still have lots of stores in North America. And they need to figure out what to do with them. Teens spent less from 2007 to 2009. That period was known as the Great Recession. Many people lost jobs and had less money to spend. Lately, there are not a lot of new clothing styles that teens want. That has also hurt sales.

## Maybe There Are Too Many Stores

The answer seems clear: More stores aren't always the way to sell more.

American Eagle said it has 150 stores to close in North America in the next three years. It is closely watching 300 more. The stores have leases, which are contracts to rent the stores. Because the leases are ending, the stores can be closed.

Tunick said that Abercrombie had closed 260 locations since 2011. Pacific Sun had closed 230 stores. Aeropostale is expected to close up to 300 in the next few years, he said.

The cuts aren't done. Abercrombie recently said it is on track to close 60 to 70 stores this year as leases end. Thomas A. Filandro works for a company called Susquehanna Financial Group. He watches retail companies. He pointed out that more than 500 of Abercrombie's store leases end by 2017. After the leases end, the company can close the stores if it wants.

Randal J. Konik is another expert on retail. He said almost one-third of teen store space could be closed over the next three years.

## People Will Always Want To Walk Into A Store

Still, things aren't all bad for companies that own shopping centers. Things hit a low point in 2010 and 2011. Now, most shopping center space is full, said Jesse Tron. He works for a group that supports shopping centers.

Tron noted 94 percent of sales in the United States are still made in stores. The rest are made online or through smartphones or tablets.

Retailers are looking to combine online and offline stores. That may lead to more stores closing. But Tron says other retailers, like Uniqlo and H&amp;M, are opening stores. Also, some online-only sellers are finding they want physical spaces to get more attention and give customers a different shopping experience.

"Experience" is likely to be a popular word going forward. Retailers hope to make stores welcoming and the visits worth the effort.
