HOMS, Syria â€” A terrible fight has been going on inside Syria, a country in the Middle East. The war has now lasted for five years.

Fighters are trying to remove President Bashar Assad, the country's leader. Assad and his men have been fighting back. The fighting happens in places where people live.

The city of Homs in Syria was once crowded and busy. Now, not much of it is left.

Everywhere, buildings have been blown up. The streets are filled with broken bits and pieces.

Many people have left the city. Some have moved to safer parts of Syria, or to other countries.

There are some people who have remained in Homs. For them the city feels strangely empty. It is almost a bit spooky.

## Friends, Families Move Away

Elia Samman grew up in Homs. He now lives in another Syrian city.

Samman says his family was friendly with nine other families in Homs. Now, only three of those families are still in Syria. The rest left for other countries.

The same thing is true all over Syria. More than 4 million people have left the country. Another 8 million have moved to a different part of Syria.

In some parts of Syria, life has not changed much. Damascus is the main city of Syria. It is still crowded with people. People still fill the shops and families still go out for ice cream.

## War Makes Cities Dangerous

Just outside Damascus, things are very different. Shops have been blown up. Gunfire can be heard on the streets. Drivers passing through on roads are told not to stop.

Things are bad in the city of Aleppo, too.

Fighting goes on right inside Aleppo. Most of the people who have been killed were not even fighters. They just happened to get hit.

Many of the stores in Aleppo have closed. The owners were afraid they would get killed.

Mahmoud Badawi is different. He still keeps his small shop open.

These days Badawi mostly sells to Assad's fighters. They line up to buy food and drinks.

Badawi says he will be staying.

"Why would I leave?" Badawi says. "Aleppo is my home."
