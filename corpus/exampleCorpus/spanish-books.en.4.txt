LOS ANGELES â€” For many years, finding Spanish-language books in the U.S. was tough.

Bookstores sold few titles. And those they had were very expensive. Take, for example, a paperback copy of "Don Quixote" in the original Spanish. That could easily cost three times the price of a fancy hardcover translation in English. If it could be found at all.

Booksellers said the high prices were unavoidable. Importing books printed in Spain and Latin America was expensive.

For a time, U.S. publishers tried translating English-language bestsellers into Spanish. But these books were done poorly. Often, they had translation mistakes. So, they didn't sell well. Soon, many U.S. publishers pretty much gave up trying to reach the Spanish-speaking market.

## Spanish Titles Up, Costs Down

It became frustrating. Readers of Spanish-language books could find little to buy. And this was true even in cities such as Los Angeles where there are many Latinos.

"There was a tremendous appetite for Spanish-language books," said Los Angeles bookseller David Kipen. And it "wasn't being met."

But lately, the nation's 38 million Spanish speakers have a lot more to read. The Internet is mostly to thank for it. And the quick spread of portable digital reading devices. These include Amazon's Kindle and Barnes &amp; Noble's Nook.

For the first time, Spanish-language electronic books, or e-books, can be found easily in the U.S. And they are often cheap compared to printed books.

The last two years have seen a lot of change. The number of Spanish-language titles has tripled at some online booksellers.

And costs have gone way down. Imported hardcovers once could sell for more than $100. Now, digital versions can be bought online for less than $15.

## More Latinos With E-Readers

Spanish-language book sales in the U.S. are still small. Overall, they make up a very small amount of the nation's book sales each year. But they are growing rapidly.

Consider one eager reader: Luis Alcaraz, a native of Mexico now living in Las Vegas. He bought his Kindle four years ago. At the time, he said, there was "practically nothing available to download in Spanish."

Alcaraz said that things are very different now. He can easily find many interesting electronic titles in Spanish. These include specialized books on computers. And also the science fiction stories he likes to read during airplane flights.

"There's just been an incredible change," said Alcaraz.

His experience is not unusual. Latinos are buying tablet computers and e-readers far faster than the U.S. population as a whole. In 2011, about 1 in 20 Hispanics owned such a device; in 2012, the number had jumped to nearly 1 in 5.

## "Inquebrantable" Hits No. 1

Before 2010, there were only about 10,000 Spanish-language books offered online. This was out of a total of about 650,000 Spanish titles worldwide.

Today, many more Spanish-language books can be found online. There are nearly 65,000 e-books in Spanish on Barnes &amp; Noble's website. And the story is the same over on Amazon's Spanish-language page. It now has more than 70,000 titles. That's more than double the number it had in April 2012.

And all this growth has had a surprising effect. It has helped sales of printed books in Spanish go up as well. Publishers and booksellers now realize that many people are eager for books in Spanish. The old-fashioned printed kind too.

Take the Independent Publishers Group. It has seen sales of Spanish-language print books go way up. They have made a lot more money over the last five years.

And in July, the paperback version of "Inquebrantable," written by singer Jenni Rivera, hit the No. 1 spot on all of Amazon.com. It outsold every other book that month.
