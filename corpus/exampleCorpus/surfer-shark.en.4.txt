FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. â€” On Saturday, Ryan Shapiro went surfing.

Ryan paddled into the ocean on his surfboard. He saw a stingray jump out of the water a few feet from him. He did not think anything of it. He went out a little farther.

Then he felt it. A 4-foot-long shark bit his right arm.

He looked down at his arm. He could see the bite marks.

"I knew for sure it was a shark," he said. "I was in complete shock."

## He Still Wants To Surf

Three days later, Ryan is thinking about the attack. He said he will not let it stop him.

"I do not ever want to ever stop surfing," he said. Ryan began surfing when he was 4 years old. He also teaches people how to surf. He is now 18.

Right before the attack, he was at the beach. He was hanging out with his surfer buddies. His sister, Amanda Shapiro, was taking pictures. She is 14.

Amanda was pointing her camera at the sea. Suddenly, she heard screams and calls for help.

She saw other surfers help her brother from the water. His arm was above his head. People rushed over to help.

Amanda called their mom.

"You do not think this is ever going to happen," their mom said.

## Sharks Do Not Always Bite

Shark attacks are very rare. There are just 50 to 70 attacks on people each year.

Ryan remembers the feeling after the shark attack.

His arm hurt. He thought about just one thing. He wondered if he would surf again.

On Tuesday, Ryan was back on the beach. He watched his friends surf. Soon, he will be with them in the water.

"I am not scared," he said. "It was not the shark's fault or anything. I am just trying to get more people to be aware of the water."
