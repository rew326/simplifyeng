BOSTON, Mass. â€” Moshe Kai Cavalin is only 17 years old. Yet he has already done many grown-up things. He has two college degrees, but he is too young to vote. He flies airplanes, but he is too young to drive a car alone.

Moshe lives in San Gabriel, California. He graduated from community college at age 11. Four years later, he had a college degree in math.

## Talk About A Cool Job

This year, Moshe began taking online classes. He wanted to get a master's degree. It is the next step after a college degree. Moshe had to stop taking classes, though. He got a job with NASA, the United States space agency. He helps make technology for airplanes.

Moshe is busy with his job and school. Still, he makes time for many hobbies. He wrote a book. It was about being bullied by other kids. Moshe will get his license to fly airplanes soon. He is also very good at martial arts. He has won many trophies.

## Asian Mother, Brazilian Father

People think Moshe is special. He says he is more normal than they think. He is interested in many things. He learned about different cultures growing up. His mother is from Asia. His father is from Brazil.

Moshe does not like being called a genius. He says he likes to learn and try new things. He tries to not compare himself with others.

"I just try to do the best I can," he says.

Moshe was a quick study. His parents say that when he was 4 months old, he pointed to a jet in the sky. He said the Chinese word for airplane. That was his first word. When he was only 7, he took a hard math class called trigonometry. Most students learn this in high school. Soon Moshe needed harder classes. His mom drove him to community college. His classmates were about 10 years older than Moshe.

## Big Birthday Countdown

Moshe was surprised when NASA gave him a job. He had applied before but he was too young then. Now Moshe was perfect for a project. He uses math and computers to make airplane technology.

Moshe wants to finish his master's degree someday. Then he wants to start his own computer science company.

First, he has a bigger goal. He is counting down the days until he turns 18. Then he will be able to get his driver's license.
