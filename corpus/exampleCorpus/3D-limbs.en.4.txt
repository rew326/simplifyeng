BALTIMORE, Md. â€” Griffin Matuszek was born without part of his hand. The 5-year-old had a man-made one. It is called a prosthetic. He thought it was pretty useless and a bit scary.

Now, he has a new hand. He likes this one a lot more. It is easy for him to use.

Griffin's hand was made with a 3-D printer. A 3-D printer melts sheets of plastic into three-dimensional objects. It can make any shape.

Right away Griffin picked up a small ball and threw it, his mother said.

Each year, about 1,500 children are born without part of a hand. Many children also lose hands in accidents.

## Lots Of Kids Are Using Them

The need for 3-D hands started a network of people. Doctors, artists, inventors and parents are part of it. They want to give free hands to any child who needs one.

Albert Chi is a doctor at John Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Chi made his first 3-D hand with a printer his wife bought him for Father's Day. He found free designs online. With them, he printed a hand for about $20. Usually, man-made hands cost up to $40,000.

A group called e-NABLE matches children with 3-D printers. They have provided 3-D printed hands to more than 400 kids in the last year. The group posts free plans on its website. Using them, families can print their own hands.

The 3-D printed hands are really useful for children. Children grow quickly. They become too big for their old hands. Replacements are expensive. Parents may not be able to pay for a new one every few months or few years.

The 3-D hands also weigh less. They are easier for kids to use. They come in their favorite colors. Griffin wanted his hand to glow in the dark.

## Putting Hands Together Like Legos

To print a hand, plastic sheets are fed into a machine. They melt and the plastic comes out in layers. They look like Legos. The pieces are fitted together.

Hand pieces take up to 10 hours to print. Putting them together takes another couple of hours. Kids can make the hands grasp objects.

John Fielding is a 7-year-old from Virginia. He has a 3-D printed hand.

"Now, I can fight my sister," he said, laughing.
