WASHINGTON â€” In 1794, a Portuguese ship carrying slaves crashed off the coast of South Africa. Slaves were humans owned by other humans. About half of the slaves on the ship died. The other half were sold to new owners. Then they were sent to South America.

Two objects from the shipwreck are now headed to a new museum in Washington, D.C. One is called a ballast. It is a weight that is carried on a ship to keep it stable. The other is a wooden pulley block. It helped to lift heavy things onto the boat.

The objects can be seen next year at the new National Museum of African American History and Culture. They will be featured in an exhibit about slavery. It was a very bad time in our country's history.

## An Iron Chain, A Piece Of Paper

Lonnie Bunch is one of the museum's leaders. He believes people will want to come and see the objects. Bunch was just in South Africa. The objects will be on loan from a museum there. They will stay at the National Museum of African American History and Culture for at least 10 years. It is possible the items could be there for even longer.

The National Museum of African American History and Culture was created by lawmakers in 2003. The building will open with 11 exhibits. One of them will be about slavery.

The museum has already collected important objects from the time of slavery. One of them is an iron chain worn by a child. Another is a piece of paper showing that a 10-year-old boy was sold. There is also a slave cabin from South Carolina.

Paul Gardullo helps run the museum. He says the museum has many items that tell the story of slavery "and the way it shaped our nation." He thinks the new objects "will add to that in a unique way."

He said that the objects recovered from the shipwreck are simple. Still, he said they can still help visitors feel something about what slavery was like.

## Museum Hopes To Keep Project Going

The National Museum of African American History and Culture has been working on the "Slave Wreck Project" with five other groups. Some are here in the United States and some are in other countries.

The shipwreck off the coast of South Africa was discovered in the 1980s. At first, experts thought the ship was an older boat from the Netherlands. Then they began to study it more. They realized that the boat was from Portugal. They also found out that it carried slaves.

Since 2010, experts have been figuring out who owned the ship. They also found papers that showed what type of cargo the ship was carrying. They even found information about how the ship's captain bought a slave.

People who work with the project are in Cape Town, South Africa, this week for meetings. They hope the story of the shipwreck is just the first of many more discoveries.

Bunch said he hopes the project will last a long time. He hopes other shipwrecks will be identified. He said he would also like to see artifacts from those shipwrecks come to the museum.
