WASHINGTON â€” Traditional stamp collectors do not like Harry Potter and Bugs Bunny. At least not on their stamps.

Some stamp collectors have a problem with newer U.S. stamps. They say the committee that picks the stamps is focusing on the wrong things: pop stars and fictional characters. Fewer and fewer stamps picture important people and events from American history.

They say stamps used to celebrate important people and events. But things are changing.

## Who Gets To Be On A Stamp?

Ken Martin is head of the American Philatelic Society. The group is made up of stamp collectors. Martin is not at all happy with the new stamps.

"Harry Potter is a perfect example," Martin said. He is not pleased to see a stamp honoring the fictional boy wizard. He pointed out that Harry's creator, J.K. Rowling, is British.

"Why do you honor a British author's book?" Martin asked. Wouldn't it be much better "to honor something that reflects our country's" history?

Many say that the reason for the change is money. After all, money is something the Postal Service badly needs. It has been losing a lot of money for some time.

The newer kinds of stamps sell very well. They sell much better than traditional stamps. These might have pictures of flowers on them.

Pictures of, say, Civil War generals just are not that popular. Stamps celebrating things like "Spider-Man" or "Star Wars" are. Not surprisingly, the Postal Service is focusing on stamps that people will want to buy.

## A Postage Home Run

The Postal Service certainly came up with a hit last November: its Harry Potter stamps.

The stamps show scenes from some of the eight wildly popular Harry Potter movies. One shows Harry reading the letter admitting him to Hogwarts. Hogwarts, of course, is a school for young witches and wizards.

Various magical creatures are also featured. Among them are Dobby the house elf and Hedwig the owl.

Postal officials don't feel the need to apologize for the new stamps. They hope the stamps will make young people interested in stamp collecting.

Toni DeLancey is a Postal Service spokeswoman. According to her, the post office needs "to change and improve." She said it has to "serve the changing needs of the American public." When it comes to younger Americans, the new stamps are probably the kind "they want to see," she said.

DeLancey defended the 12-member committee that picks future stamps. The committee is just keeping up with the times, she said.

## Stamps Celebrate Lots Of Things

Not everyone agrees. Last month, one member of the committee angrily quit.

The member who quit is Benjamin Bailar. He served as head of the Postal Service during the 1970s. He suggested that the committee be ended. The only purpose of the new stamps, he said, was to make more money.

Bailar wrote that stamps "should celebrate the things that are great about the United States." The committee shouldn't be picking "comic-strip characters and pop-music characters."

Janet Klug is head of the stamp committee. She said she was disappointed by Bailar's resignation. She does not think he represents others in the group. The committee's goal, she said, is to increase interest in stamp collecting.

"I don't even know if the post office is making more money," she said. "I'm sure they would like to make more money. Who wouldn't? But it's also trying to (reach) a broader public and get them interested in stamps."
