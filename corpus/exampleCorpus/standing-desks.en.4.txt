ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill. â€” Students at Windsor Elementary School do not have to sit still in class. The classrooms have exercise machines.

Adam Boesen is 10 years old. He used one of the machines one morning. It was not during gym class. Adam used the machine during silent reading time in his classroom.

Using the machine helps him pay attention, Adam said. He chose a machine that lets him move his arms and legs. Adam moved fast. He read a book at the same time.

The machines are in special work areas. The areas are called "fit workstations."

## Students Loved This Test

Shelley Fabrizio is the principal at the school. She came up with the idea of bringing in the machines. The machines are being used by children in kindergarten through fifth grade. They can bounce and pedal while learning.

The principal said kids love to move. The school did not want them sitting all day. The school bought desks where students stand. There are also bikes that stay still while children pedal. Some desks have the moving machine that Adam used.

The fit workstations cost about $3,635 each. Students were able to try the machines last spring. The students were asked about the machines. Each student picked a favorite one. Then the teachers knew which machines were the most popular.

The students loved the chance to test them. Many students said they could pay more attention while they used the machines. That is what the school wanted.

## Running To The Moving Machine

Many children need help paying attention in school. They all have different ways to learn. Students can choose to use a fit workstation. They can also choose a regular desk.

Each classroom started with one desk where students could stand. The kids and teachers loved them. The school bought more.

Christina Philo teaches at the school. She knew the kids would like the fit workstations.

The students all ran to the moving machine, she said. Christina made a list. It shows when students can use the machines. Everyone gets a turn. Then the list starts over.
