The two men were cavers. They liked finding out what was inside caves. In September 2013 they decided to head inside a cave in South Africa. The cave is one of a group of caves known as Rising Star.

The men were looking for a space deep underground. Such a space is known as a chamber. It is something like a big room hidden inside a cave. No one had ever been inside this chamber.

## Looking For Old Bones

Most people believed there were no more treasures inside the cave. American scientist Lee Berger did not think that was true. He asked the men to keep their eyes open for old bones.

To get to the chamber the men had to climb and crawl through the dark. Then they had to wriggle sideways through a narrow crack for 400 feet.

At last the men reached the hidden chamber. They dropped down and entered it.

## Different From Human Bones

What they found amazed them. The chamber contained more than 1,500 bones and teeth. The bones were strange. They almost looked like a human's bones, but were different.

The men told Berger what they had found. Berger knew it was something really big. For a month digging continued inside the chamber. Everything that was dug up was carefully studied.

## More Than 2.5 Million Years Old

On Thursday Berger was finally ready to announce what had been found. The bones are more than 2.5 million years old, he said. They belonged to a kind of animal no one has ever seen before. The animal came before humans but is related to humans. It was like a human but had a smaller brain.

Scientists have named the newly found animal Homo naledi. "Naledi" is an African word that means "star." The word was picked because of the name of the caves. "Homo" is the Latin word for "man."

## They Walked And Swung From Trees

Homo naledi's fingers were long and curved. This allowed it to climb and swing from trees. Its shoulders and chest were like those of an ape. The animal had long legs and feet like a person's, though. It was able to walk standing up. Berger said Homo naledi could also use tools.

Berger and his team plan to return to the chamber.

"This chamber has not given up all its secrets," he said.
