BEIRUT â€” A group of United Nations inspectors arrived outside of Syria's capital on Aug. 26. They were looking for signs that poison gas was used against people. The gas attack supposedly happened last week. The Middle Eastern country has been split by civil war.

The U.N.'s inspection had been delayed a few hours after snipers fired upon them.

The inspectors traveled to an area southwest of the capital Damascus. The sniper bullets forced the U.N. vehicles to turn back at first. Snipers shoot from far away. They are usually specially trained. A U.N. vehicle was struck in the shooting. No one was injured, the U.N. said in a statement. The damaged vehicle was replaced. The mission continued.

The inspectors visited a pair of field hospitals. They also met with witnesses, the U.N. said.

## Safe Passage For Inspectors

The U.N. appeared to have worked out an agreement with the two sides in the war. The inspectors will be able to travel safely. No details were released. Each side blamed the other for the sniper fire. The civil war in Syria began in March 2011.

The inspectors are unarmed. They will continue their work on Aug. 27. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon promised that the investigators would be kept safe.

The team is supposed to find out whether chemical weapons were used. They are not there to find out who used them. The rebels and the government have been trading blame for who was responsible. Many in the West want foreign armies to get involved. Each side has its own international supporters.

Those who are against Syria's government said that a poison-gas attack last week killed hundreds of people outside Damascus. The people killed were not soldiers, they said. There was no word about whether the inspectors learned anything on Monday. Nobody said whether they found anything to back up what the rebels said. Or if they found anything to show the rebels were lying.

## Inspectors Talk To Witnesses

Syrian President Bashar Assad strongly denied what the rebels said. His said this in an interview with the Russian newspaper Izvestia. The comments were published on Monday.

The inspectors traveled to two field hospitals. They interviewed witnesses, doctors and people who lived through the attack, Ban said. The inspectors took statements. They also collected unspecified "samples."

Officials previously said that the team would be seeking traces of soil that had signs of poison. They would also collect tissue, hair and other samples from victims. The samples will be taken for laboratory tests. It could take weeks before the results are known.

It was not clear why the team initially chose to visit Muadhamiya. About 80 people were reported killed there in last week's suspected chemical attack. But the hardest-hit area was said to be in the opposite direction.

An anti-government group in Muadhamiya was waiting when the inspectors arrived, according to someone in the town. The person was reached on a video-messaging service. The U.N. experts spoke with doctors and patients at a field hospital. They also took blood and hair samples, the person said.

## U.S. And Russia Disagree Over Syria

Some in the U.N. group then went to visit a mosque. The religious site was allegedly hit during the chemical attack last week. They visited another reported site of a rocket attack.

Video that was supposedly from the inspectors' visit showed U.N. workers wearing blue helmets speaking with people. They were also visiting what looked like a medical treatment area. Some patients were lying in beds.

Chemical weapons are considered especially bad. They cause terrible suffering along with death.

The White House said on Sunday there was "very little doubt" that Syrian forces had used poison gas against ordinary people. The statement seemed to suggest the U.S. may get its military involved.

Russia said Monday it warned U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry not to use force against Syria. It would be "extremely dangerous" to do so, Russia said.

The civil war in Syria is one of several on which the United States and Russia strongly disagree.
