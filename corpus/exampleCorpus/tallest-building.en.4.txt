A group of building experts said so on Tuesday. The building is in New York. It beat out a building in Chicago called the Willis Tower.

The decision was not simple. The experts had to decide what to measure. The tower in New York has a cone on top. It is called a spire. The spire does not have glass around it like the rest of the building. Some people say it is just decoration.

They say it is not part of the building. So the experts had to decide if it counted.

The building is 1,776 feet high with the spire. The spire makes it taller than the Willis Tower which is 1,451 feet tall.

## Replaces Fallen Twin Towers

The height also means something special. The United States was born in 1776. The new World Trade Center is 1,776 feet tall. It takes the place of the twin towers. They were part of the old World Trade Center. The towers were destroyed in an attack in 2001.

The people who designed the new building wanted to send a message with the height. The message was about patriotism and bouncing back. They wanted to show that New York wasn't afraid to build an even bigger building where the old towers fell.

Art Bell is an architect. He said height matters when you make a building. People want to be able to look down and see a lot of the world.

"There's something special about being high up," he said.
