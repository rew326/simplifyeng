SACRAMENTO, Calif. – Dave Vierra started small. He planted his first corn maze 12 years ago.  It was meant to be a sideshow. His main business was his popular pumpkin patch in West Sacramento. The maze covered just half an acre, about half the size of a football field.

But just like field corn, it quickly grew — and grew. Now he has two corn mazes. The other 2-acre maze is "haunted" for weekend tours. Zombies and other characters provide fright-filled fun.

There is more to do at Vierra Farms than just navigate through mazes. Kids can jump on a huge air-filled pillow. They can play in a giant "corn box." It's the same idea as a sandbox, only this one is filled with dried corn. The Cornival also offers pig races, pony and hay rides. Look out for the pumpkin chuckin' cannon. It shoots the orange gourds 1,500 feet into the air!

"It's all the stuff we used to do as kids," said Vierra, a lifelong farmer. "As a kid, you walked into the cornfield at night and a friend would jump out to try and scare you. You'd jump into a pile of straw or climb on top of haystacks. Who doesn't like that? It's all about fun activities involving farming."

## Helping Family Farms Survive

Agritainment is big business on small family farms. "Agri" refers to agriculture and "tainment" refers to entertainment. The idea is to turn agriculture into entertainment for non-farming folks. Few activities are more popular than corn mazes. The attraction also brings in big money.

Family farms are struggling right now, says Kamille Combs. She works for MAiZE Inc. The company creates hundreds of mazes nationwide during Halloween season. In fact, the company built the mazes at Dave's Pumpkin Patch.

Combs says most of the people she works with are family farmers. They have lived on their land for years. They are trying to make money, so they don't lose the land. Still, starting a corn maze can be risky. They are a lot of work to build. Farmers can never be sure if they will make enough money on one to cover their costs.

Still, the corn-maze craze has produced businesses. Many of them specialize in building and operating mazes. Utah-based MAiZE leads that list. The company has built more than 2,000 mazes. MAiZE negotiates prices with each farm. Vierra Farms paid "under $2,000" for its two mazes.

"We'll do more than 250 (mazes) this year," Combs said. "Every year, we've seen more and more mazes springing up."

## High-Tech Mazes

Corn mazes may seem like old-fashioned entertainment. But they are actually high-tech. Mazes are designed on a computer. The corn rows act like straight lines on a graph. A GPS is used to map out the trails. The paths are mowed when the corn is ankle high.

Vierra expects about 30,000 visitors to his farm by Halloween night. Competition has grown fierce over the years. Farm owners feel pressured to create surprising maze designs.

"When I started, we were the only corn maze around here," Vierra said. He opened his pumpkin patch business 23 years ago. "Now, there are corn mazes all over the place."

The Halloween corn maze is a fairly new, and all-American, experience. It first surfaced in the early 1990s, according to Corn Mazes America. By 2008, more than 800 mazes nationwide had become yearly traditions. This year's count will top 1,000. Most are found in the Northeast and Great Lakes states.

## "It's Like Disneyland"

Customers expect more every year from Dave's Pumpkin Patch. Vierra gives them what they want. This season, he installed a zip-line. Visitors can ride the zip-line above the cornfields. There is also a free photo booth. Visitors can snap photos and immediately post them to Facebook.

"People always want something new," Vierra said. "You've got to keep it fresh. It's like Disneyland always adding rides and attractions. If you stay the same, it can get stale and there's no reason to come back."

Maze builders use slow-maturing field corn. This way the stalks stay green as long as possible. After Halloween, the crop becomes cattle feed. MAiZE experts say farms can make $5,000 to $50,000 from an average maze, depending on location. Compare that to an acre of field corn, which sells for less than $1,000. The corn costs about $500 to plant.

Vierra also grows tons of Halloween pumpkins. They are sold in local supermarkets along with several other crops. But he does not plan to stop creating corn mazes any time soon. "I plant my corn Aug. 13," Vierra said.  "In 60 days, it's 8 feet tall. That's perfect for a maze."
