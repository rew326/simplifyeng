WASHINGTON â€” Millions of starfish are dying. The deaths are happening all along the West Coast, where North America meets the Pacific Ocean. Some lawmakers from Washington state are trying to do something about it. They want to find out why there are so many starfish deaths. They say it is time for Congress to get involved.

Rangers at Olympic National Park first noticed the problem in 2013. The sickness has affected 20 different types of starfish. The animals are also known as sea stars.

The sea stars get wounds on their bodies. They begin curling up. Then they lose their legs. Eventually, the sea stars turn into mush.

## They Are Dying In Warmer Waters

Scientists say a disease has attacked the starfish. They think climate change has caused the disease. Climate change is the strange changes in the Earth's weather. It includes the Earth getting warmer over time. The starfish disease is spreading the fastest in warmer ocean waters.

Drew Harvell is a professor at Cornell University. She has been studying the starfish deaths. She said she does not think there has been a disease that has hit such a large group of animals before.

Congressman Denny Heck wants the government to call the problem an emergency. He wants the decision to be made before the starfish all die.

Right now, there is no way for the government to handle the deaths, he said.

## Money Is Needed Now

Heck has asked Congress to pass a law. It is called the Marine Disease Emergency Act. It would force U.S. government agencies to make a plan to try to stop the starfish deaths. The government would also have to give scientists money for research. It is not clear how much Heck's plan would cost.

Heck first wants Congress to set aside $12 million. That money will be used to get government agencies to share research. He said the law would create a national place to keep information. Then research could be shared quickly.

If the law is passed, it also would set up a national volunteer group to advise the government on marine disease emergencies. Heck's plan also would set up a way for people to give money to help the starfish.

## Bigger Fish Need The Starfish Too

Congressman Derek Kilmer is working with Heck. Kilmer said he wanted to help because starfish were "turning into goo." He said making sure the starfish live is important. They help bigger fish survive.

Harvell said dead starfish had been found all along the West Coast. People have found them from Alaska to Mexico. She said the problem had not been studied as much near the Atlantic Ocean. However, sea star deaths had been reported in many states there. Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Louisiana and Florida are some of them.

"It's pretty horrific," she said. "Their organs start to fall out" of cuts on the body, she said. Then "their arms walk away."
