GENEVA â€” The United States and Russia made a deal Saturday. They agreed to make Syria get rid of its poison gas weapons. Syria's President Bashar al-Assad has one week to show what kind of weapons his country has. He must also show where they are stored.

There is a November deadline for ending Syria's ability to make the weapons. Anything that could be used to make the weapons must be destroyed by the middle of next year.

The deal says inspectors from other countries can go anywhere in Syria immediately. Nobody would be able to get in the way. Their first inspections have to be finished by November.

U.S. President Barack Obama praised the agreement. He called it an "important, concrete step" toward the goal of destroying the weapons. But the United States could still act with force if the peaceful solution did not work, he said.

## Syria Seen Going Along With Deal

A U.S. military attack seemed just hours away only two weeks ago. Now it appears far from happening. Syria could be attacked if it does not follow the agreement. But the U.N. Security Council would have to give permission. Russia can stop the council from doing that through a veto.

Syria and Assad did not immediately react. Syria gets most of its weapons from Russia. So it will probably do what Russia agreed to.

Syrian rebels were not happy with the agreement. They said it lets Assad get away with the deaths of hundreds of people killed with poison gas.

But rebel Gen. Salim Idriss said his group would help the inspectors. It would not shoot when inspectors pass through government-held areas where rebels are fighting. But Idriss said the rebels would not agree to a general cease-fire. Idriss heads the Syrian Military Council. The U.S. supports his group.

How other rebel groups would respond is still not known. Those groups include two that have ties to al-Qaida. They are also the Syrian rebels' best fighters.

## Russia Supports Assad In War

Magnus Ranstorp is an expert on terrorism at the Swedish Defense College. He said that both groups do not like the United States, Russia or the United Nations. They could target the attempt to control poison gas. Rebels from Central Asia and the Caucasus have fought bitter battles against Russia. They could try to cause problems.

"I think this is definitely a risk," he said.

The agreement is a remarkable event in Syria's civil war. More than 100,000 people from both sides have been killed during the war. A total of 6.5 million people have been forced from their homes in the past 30 months. There also seemed to be no way the United States and Russia could agree about how the conflict should be resolved. At least not until recently.

Only two weeks ago, the United States appeared to be just hours away from sending missiles into Syria. The attack was going to be punishment for a supposed Aug. 21 poison gas attack that killed hundreds of people. Russia was defending Syria. It insisted that the rebels were responsible for the gas attack.

## U.S. Doesn't Completely Trust Russia

At one point, Russian President Vladimir Putin called U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry a liar. Last week, Putin wrote a column that appeared in the New York Times. It accused the United States of violating international law for its Syrian threats.

But it took just two days to hammer out the agreement. There was little sign of bad feelings when the agreement was announced on Saturday.

Kerry indicated the U.S. did not completely trust Russia. He recalled what President Ronald Reagan said about dealing with the Soviet Union: "Trust, but verify." Verify means you have to make sure.

"Verify, then verify" is the new U.S. motto, Kerry said.
