The Cuban crocodile was already very rare. Now it is facing a new danger, scientists say.

The problem is that many Cuban crocodiles do not mate with each other. Instead, they have been mating with American crocodiles.

Cuban and American crocodiles have been mating quite a bit. Their offspring are a mix of the two types.

Cuban and American crocodiles are considered separate kinds of animals, or species. The reason is that each has its own set of genes. Genes are the body's instructions. They are passed down from parent to child. Genes shape how living things look and behave.

## Genes Have Many Roles

In humans, for example, there is a gene for red hair. In Cuban crocodiles, there are genes that make them what they are. A species' complete set of genes is called a genome.

When two different species mate, scientists call it interbreeding.

Interbreeding is causing the Cuban species to change. Its genome is becoming more mixed. In each baby, some Cuban genes are replaced by American crocodile genes. With each new generation, more and more Cuban genes are lost.

Eventually, the species could disappear.

## They Already Knew

Scientists already knew the two species were breeding together. Now they know just how much it is happening.

A team of scientists led by Yoamel Milián-García made the discovery. The team studied genes found in the scales of 227 wild crocodiles. What they saw proved that interbreeding was happening a lot. Nearly half of the crocodiles had mixed genes.

The Cuban crocodile was once common. However, hunting killed many. Today there are only around 4,000 left.

Now the Cuban crocodile could disappear altogether. Its genome may take in too many American crocodile genes. If that happens, it will no longer be a separate species.

## Careful Study Of Crocodiles

American crocodiles are not in the same kind of danger. There are many more of them around. Their genes will not disappear.

Scientists say the Cuban crocodile is special. They believe it is worth protecting.

Milián-García is trying to figure out what causes the interbreeding. He suspects the reason is hunting and the disappearance of swamps and marshes. Both are driving the two species into the same areas. The two types of crocodile are now much more likely to interbreed.

Milián-García's team did not only look at wild crocodiles. They also studied 137 captive Cuban crocodiles.

Those animals live at the Zapata Swamp Captive Breeding Farm. They are kept apart from American crocodiles. A study of their genes gave scientists some good news.

About 40 of the animals still had the special genes of the Cuban crocodile. In the future, those animals could be very important. They may help keep the Cuban crocodile from disappearing.
