CHICAGO, Ill. — On Sept. 11, 2001, Islamic fighters attacked different places in the United States. They attacked in the name of their religion, Islam. Afterwards, Pardeep Kaleka worried people might think his family was Muslim. Followers of Islam are called Muslims. Kaleka thought people might attack in revenge. 

However, the Kaleka family is not Muslim. They are Sikhs. It is a southeast Asian religion that says everyone is equal. Sikhism is a different religion than Islam.

Not long ago, Islamic fighters attacked again. They attacked in Paris and California. This time, Kaleka will do things differently. He wants to help Muslims. 

Sikhs and Muslims are joining together. They are defending their religions.

## Islam And Sikhism

The two groups are teaching about their religions. They are also planning protests. They pushed the FBI to track hate crimes. A hate crime is an attack against a person. It is done because of his color or religion.

Sikhism believes in one god, like Christianity, Judaism and Islam. It was founded more than 500 years ago in Southeast Asia. The religion has about 27 million followers worldwide. Most of them are in India.

There are more than 500,000 Sikhs in the United States. Male Sikhs often cover their heads with a cloth called a turban. They do not shave their beards.

There have been more hate crimes against Sikhs recently. The crimes increased after the attacks in Paris and California. 

Last week, a Sikh temple was attacked. The temple was in California. Sikh children are sometimes bullied.

## Facebook User Insults Athlete

Darsh Singh used to be a basketball player. He was the first Sikh in the NCAA to play in a turban. People have insulted him his whole life, he said.

Last week, a photo on Facebook showed Singh. It said unkind things about Islam. A friend answered the post. He told people to learn more about the religion. The friend's post got thousands of likes.

Madihha Ahussain is a lawyer with Muslim Advocates. She said people do not know much about Sikhism or Islam. Only a few people do violent things. Many groups are blamed. It is not fair, she said.

Some Sikhs have been attacked.

A teenager near Chicago called a Sikh a bad name. The teen also hit him in the face, breaking his cheekbone.

In 2012, Kaleka's father was killed at a Sikh temple in a hate crime. The gunman was white. He thought white people were better than other groups.

Afterward, the Muslim community got in touch with Sikhs. The two groups started to work together to fight hate. Christians, Jews and others are working with them.
