SAN JOSE, Calif. — College student Michael Sandoval has made a remarkable discovery: a galaxy unlike anything ever seen before.

Galaxies are made up of millions or billions of stars. The stars in a particular group — or system — are held together by gravity. Normally, stars in a system are much farther apart than what Sandoval spotted.

Twenty-one-year-old Sandoval is a student at San Jose State University. Not too long ago, he enrolled in his first astrophysics class. Astrophysics is the study of the stars and planets.

Sandoval stumbled upon his unusual find after only a week of looking. He and his professor have named what he spotted a hypercompact cluster. They believe it is the remains of one galaxy that was swallowed up by another.

Professor Aaron Romanowsky said it's astounding how quickly his student discovered something important. "Some people take years and never find" anything, he said.

## I Can Find One Of Those Too!

The search was a welcome distraction for Sandoval: His mother died of cancer in October. In the last years of his mom's life, Sandoval helped take care of her. At times he had to rush her to the emergency room at night, then drag himself to class the next day.

Several months after his mother died, Sandoval enrolled in Romanowsky's astrophysics course. He soon learned that classmate Richard Vo had discovered something highly unusual: a super-dense dwarf galaxy. Dwarf galaxies have fewer stars than ones like our own. The dwarf galaxy Vo discovered is possibly the densest ever found.

Sandoval's thought was immediate: "I want to find one too."

Sandoval set to work on his laptop. Using pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, he began searching the universe for unusual objects. "I didn't want to be sitting home, feeling sorry for myself," said Sandoval. "That's not what she would have wanted anyway."

Instead, he, Vo and Romanoswky are rushing to release their findings.

## Dwarf Galaxies Waiting To Be Discovered

Romanowsky was one of the first scientists to discover a dense dwarf galaxy. What Vo later found was the same type of galaxy, but especially dense.

Sandoval was also searching for the same kind of galaxy. What he turned up instead was something "weird," Romanowsky said. It was unlike anything Romanowsky had ever seen.

Think of a dwarf galaxy as being like an apple core, Romanowsky said. What Sandoval found is like the seeds. In other words, it is even smaller and denser.

Until recently, scientists hadn't thought to search for dense star systems.

"It's something that's been hiding in plain sight," Romanowsky said.

The new discoveries could reshape our understanding of the universe.

Both students were passionate about the project, Romanowsky said. They were pushing him, not the other way around. "They're sending me emails at midnight: 'Professor, will you send me more' information?" he said.

## Nothing Boring About It

Their discoveries could help bring more students into the sciences, said scientist Natalie Batalha. Glimpsing something no one has ever seen is an amazing experience, she said. It feels like uncovering "the mysteries of the universe."

Not many young people want to become scientists, she added. Perhaps, she suggested, they mistakenly think scientists are boring.

Vo certainly doesn't fit anyone's idea of the boring scientist. He has tattoos on his arms and a funny sense of humor. Before beginning his project, he described his task as "basically finding Waldo."

As for Sandoval, his discovery makes him think of his mom. It always embarrassed him when she bragged about his science studies, he said. He felt he had done nothing special.

"After this has happened," he said, "I'm pretty sure she's proud."
