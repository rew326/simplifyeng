PHILADELPHIA, Pa. — "Hope" was a skinny dog. Carol Skaziak found her in a dog shelter. Hope's bones stuck out. She looked bad, but she had great spirit. Carol thought she might make a great police dog.

Police dogs have a great sense of smell. They can sniff out bombs. They also hear very well. Some police dogs help find bad guys who are hiding.

Carol started a group to help dogs in shelters. The group is called Throw Away Dogs Project. The group saves dogs that are not wanted. It give the dogs a safe place to live. They also train the dogs. Then they give the dogs to the police. 

It feels great to save a dog's life, Carol said. She is also happy when she can give them jobs. 

## Rousey Can Bite Bad Guys

Carol brought Hope home from the shelter. Carol gave the dog a new name, Rousey. The dog was named after the figher Ronda Rousey.

Rousey trained for nine weeks. Then came an important test.

A trainer took Rousey to a field. He put on a sleeve. The sleeve was padded to protect him. The trainer hit the sleeve with a stick. The trainer wanted Rousey to bite the sleeve. It would show that Rousey could bite bad guys.

Rousey barked loudly. Then, she bit the sleeve. She refused to let go.

The trainer smiled. It was just what he hoped Rousey would do.

## Time To Say Goodbye

Carol was excited. Rousey proved that she was brave. Rousey proved she could help catch bad guys.   

Now, it was time for Carol to say goodbye.

Carol was sad. She would miss Rousey. She started to cry.

"Please take care of her," Carol said.
