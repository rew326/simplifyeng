ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — A new exhibit of artist Andy Warhol features his paintings and drawings. It also shows off self-portraits taken with the Instagram of the 1970s -- the Polaroid camera.

Yes, it seems, the artist was an early taker of selfies.

There's Warhol posing with a skull. There's Warhol looking moody in black and white. And there's Warhol squeezed in between former Beatles member John Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono. Extra points for Warhol: a celebrity selfie!. Big in the 1970s, the Polaroid camera had self-developing film that let people see photos instantly.

The exhibit is full of 1970s clothing and disco-era glitter. But Warhol's take on fame feels modern. It fits right in with modern America's love of reality TV and celebrities.

## Dali's Melting Clocks

"Warhol: Art. Fame. Mortality." includes more than 100 of Warhol's artworks and films. They are on loan from the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. Warhol, who said that "everyone would be world-famous for 15 minutes," was born there. He died in 1987 in New York City. His paintings now sell for more than $100 million.

The exhibit opens to the public Saturday and runs through April 27.

It's a first for The Dali, an entire museum devoted to the surrealist artist. Surrealism is an artistic style that featured strange, dream-like works. Salvador Dali was a leading surrealist artist. Born in Spain, he died in 1989. Dali was known for painting things like melting clocks.

In 2011, the museum moved into a new building along the city's waterfront. The Warhol exhibit is the first special exhibit in its new home.

Museum director Hank Hine said the exhibit is appropriate to Dali's memory.

The exhibit features some of Warhol's famous silkscreens pictures. They include a red self-portrait taken a year before he died. Silkscreening is a special printing method. It uses a woven screen to print a picture. T-shirts and posters are often printed by silkscreening.

## Warhol's Campbell's Soup Cans

There are several pictures of Jackie Kennedy Onassis, wife of U.S. President John F. Kennedy. There are a few versions of his Campbell's Soup can paintings. Warhol was known for painting Campbell's Soup cans. There are also TV monitors set up to show the artist's "screen tests." These are short films of a single person against a plain background.

Dali and Warhol had much in common, Hine said. The exhibit contains photos of the men goofing around in a hotel room together.

Dali was older — born in 1904 — than Warhol. Warhol was born in 1928. Both amazed the public with their attention-getting works of art.

Warhol often visited Dali when Dali stayed in a New York hotel. One story says that Dali tied Warhol to a spinning board and splattered paint over him. Warhol also made one of his famous "screen tests" of Dali. Warhol told Dali not to move during the three-minute filming.

Dali just walked away.

The exhibit not only shows Warhol's screen tests. It also give people a chance to make their own.

The show has a copy of his screen test set. Visitors can sit in front of a camera. They send their "tests" to Twitter and Facebook. So, everyone can have their 15 minutes of fame on social media.

Warhol would have approved.
