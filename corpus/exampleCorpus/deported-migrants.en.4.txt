MEXICO CITY â€” In a corner of Alejandra Pinzon's room in Mexico City is a pink drawer full of her favorite possessions. They remind her of a life that's slipping away.

There are homecoming photos from her Kansas high school and a report card with lots of A's. And then there's a Taylor Swift concert ticket.

"I'm obsessed with Taylor Swift," said Pinzon, who's known by her friends as Ali. She recalled how her best friend, Kristin, surprised her during the concert with a birthday message. It flashed on a screen behind the country singer: "Happy late 17th birthday, Alibear!"

Pinzon made a tough decision just months after seeing Swift perform in 2010. She went back to Mexico. Her choice would forever shape her future.

## Homesick For The U.S. Midwest

Pinzon was 17 then and living in the United States illegally. Her father had taken her to the U.S. when she was 11. He hoped to build a better life. She had gone to schools in Kansas and Missouri.

Now, she had graduated from high school. She wanted to go to college, but knew that wasn't possible. Most likely she'd be stuck working a low-paying job. She might get deported at any time.

If she went back to Mexico, she decided, she'd be able to get her degree there. Then, a U.S. company might help her to return. She might be back in as little as four or five years.

Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way.

Pinzon, now 21, lives in Mexico City. But her heart is still in the American Midwest. She is one of around 500,000 young Mexicans who returned to their homeland from 2005 to 2010.

On Aug. 9, 2010, Pinzon stepped off a plane into a country that felt foreign to her, even though it was her native land. She didn't know when she'd be back in the U.S. again.

"I felt like I was going somewhere where I had never been before," she said. "I didn't really speak a lot of Spanish."

## Told College Has To Wait

Most of Pinzon's new friends in Mexico also recently moved from the U.S. She doesn't have to worry about being judged by them when she speaks English. Until she found them, she felt as if no one in this huge city understood her homesickness.

"In my mind, I felt like I was the only one who knew English," she said. "I felt like I was the only one who was going through this situation. I still get very homesick. I miss my friends. I miss everything."

Pinzon could have gone to a good college if she hadn't been in the U.S. illegally. She had done very well in high school. She dreamed about studying journalism or international relations.

After she returned to Mexico, Pinzon tried to get into college there. But her U.S. high school records weren't recognized. She was told she could take a test to get into college when she turned 21.

She ended up finding a low-paying job answering the phone all day.

## "What Have I Done?"

Then in June of 2012, her sister called with big news. A new law called the DREAM Act had just been passed. Now, illegal immigrants who graduated from high school would no longer be deported from the United States. If Pinzon hadn't left the country, the new law would have helped her.

"What have I done?" Pinzon thought to herself, feeling sick to her stomach.

She should have just waited, Pinzon now says. "It would have just taken me two years. The two years I've been doing this, I could have been doing it there."

Ali still hopes to attend college in Mexico. But going back to the United States illegally is also on her mind, she admits. "I'm always going to think about going back," she said.

Her sister Lulu even bought her a plane ticket. But she's not sure whether she's ready to start over a second time.

She's keeping the ticket, though. It's stored on her computer, near the pink drawer with the rest of her American stuff.
