NEW YORK, N.Y. â€” Wall paintings are turning up around New York City. There are also paintings in Jersey City, New Jersey.

One shows a woman wearing a head scarf. Another is of a flock of birds. A third painting shows a gazelle.

The paintings talk about human rights in Iran. The country is in the Middle East. Its government is anti-American. There is no freedom of speech. Newspapers cannot print news against the government, Islam or other matters.

The paintings let people know about a group started by Maziar Bahari. He is a reporter. Bahari spent 118 days in jail in Iran.

## Let's Talk About The Art

Bahari's story was told in a movie called "Rosewater." Bahari named his group, Not A Crime. It wants Iran to let newspapers write about anything.

The group also wants Iran to let Baha'i students attend college. Baha'i is a religion. The group believes in one God. It believes that all humans are equal.

Bahari hopes world leaders will pay attention to the art. They will be in New York in September. He hopes the art will lead them to talk about human rights.

## No Spy Jokes Please

Bahari was working in Iran for Newsweek magazine in 2009. Iran charged him with the crime of spying. He had joked on an American television show about being a spy. In jail, he was beaten, he said.

Iran let Bahari out of prison. He left the country. A judge then told him he had to spend 13 more years in prison.

Iran has put 30 reporters in prison. Only China has put more reporters in jail, the Committee to Protect Journalists says. A reporter is a journalist.

## Freedom To Paint And Talk

The woman shown in the wall painting is named Atena Farghadani. She is an artist. She is serving a 12-year prison sentence in Iran. She created a cartoon that complained about an Iranian law. The painting shows her without a mouth.

Another artist is named Ron English. He is painting a picture of a large warning. It will say that photography is not allowed.

Art on the street gets people's attention, English said.

Artist Marina Zumi is from Argentina. She painted the picture of the gazelle. She hopes it will make people to talk about fairness.

A man named Parris Douglas walked up to look at the gazelle. He said he liked the freedoms in America. People can express how they feel and no one tells them to stop.
