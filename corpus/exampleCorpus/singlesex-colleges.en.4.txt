LOS ANGELES â€” Sweet Briar and Deep Springs colleges are single-gender schools. That means Sweet Briar only lets women enroll. Deep Springs allows only men. There are not many colleges like these left in the United States. Many are struggling to stay open, including Sweet Briar and Deep Springs.

Some people wonder if single-gender colleges are still necessary.

Over the last 50 years, women's colleges have been going away. Some have let men in classes. Others have just closed. There were 230 women's colleges 50 years ago. Now there are only 46. The information comes from a group that supports women's colleges called the Women's College Coalition. A lot of the women-only colleges went away in the late 1960s and early 1970s. That was when many men-only schools started to let in women.

## Too Few Students At Sweet Briar

The people who run Sweet Briar said in February that the school would close this summer. The school has been around for 114 years. The announcement surprised teachers at the school. Administrators said the fewer students were attending. They also said it was hard to get high schoolers interested in a single-gender college. Another problem was that the school is far away from shops.

People later learned that the school owes a lot of money. Its leaders were worried about not being able to pay the money back. They said that even letting male students go to the school would not help.

The teachers from the school went to court. They asked a judge to stop the school from closing. Graduates of the school also are protesting.

## Schools Need Good Leaders

Some single-sex colleges have problems, but they can still stay open, said David L. Warren. He runs a group that represents colleges and universities.

The people who run the schools will need to show good leadership for the schools to survive, he said. They must want to keep the colleges single-gender, he said. They will also need smart business plans and interesting classes, Warren added.

Women's colleges are important, said Michele Ozumba. She runs the Women's College Coalition. The schools can help women become leaders, she said. Minorities and students who are the first in their families to go to college may especially need women's colleges, she said.

## Deep Springs College Is Unusual

Unlike Sweet Briar, Deep Springs is not in danger of closing. Still, there is a plan for the school to change.

The tiny two-year school has been around since 1917. Its 28 male students do not pay for classes. They follow an unusual program. They spend their time reading famous books and pitching hay on a big ranch. Many later go to top colleges for four-year degrees.

In 2011, the people who run Deep Springs decided to let women in. A men-only school was no longer good preparation for the students' futures, officials said.

Those plans, however, are on hold for now. Some graduates of the school are taking the school to court. They argue that the school should not be allowed to enroll women. The school was started to educate "promising young men."

## Judge Says The School Should Change

In November, a judge ruled that the legal papers that set up the school could be changed. The school's mission could be expanded to educating "promising young people."

The case will now be heard by a higher court. The school says there are no plans right now to let women in class.

Some officials at the few men's colleges left defend keeping women out. In the last 10 years, fewer men are going to college and finishing. Men are falling behind women. Men-only colleges, they argue, can help fix that. They can give special attention to those male students, the officials said.
