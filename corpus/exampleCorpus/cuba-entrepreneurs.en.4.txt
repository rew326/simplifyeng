For more than 50 years, it was illegal for Americans to trade with Cuba. This year, President Barack Obama announced that the two countries are beginning to make peace. They have been enemies for a long time. A big part of making peace is trading — buying and selling goods to each other.

In Cuba, many businesses are controlled by the Cuban government. Still, there are some independent businesspeople. The U.S. government wants to open up trade so these people — entrepreneurs — can make more money.

U.S. officials created new rules that make it easier for the two countries to trade with each other. The rules say that some items can be traded and some cannot.

## Rules Are Complicated

The new rules are long and complicated. Larry Feldman is a lawyer in Miami. He tried to make the rules easier to understand. To do this, he made a list of all of the products that Cuba can export — or sell — to the United States. He calls it his "yes" list.

His list is easier for most people to understand than the laws themselves. Still, the list he made is long and detailed.

There are more than 480,000 entrepreneurs in Cuba. In Cuba, entrepreneurs are called cuentapropistas.

The U.S. government hopes that the new policy makes it easier for these workers to succeed.

## What Can And Cannot Be Traded

The new policy allows Cuba to sell certain things to Americans. It also prohibits some things from being traded.

Paper products, glass, hats, umbrellas, toys, games, flowers and feathers can be traded. So can soap, candles, perfume, jewelry, watches and musical instruments.

The State Department also has a list of things that cannot be traded. That list includes sugar and prepared drinks. Many of the items on the "no" list are made by the Cuban government.

## Trade List Should Help Cuban Businesses

The State Department said the list should help Cuban entrepreneurs. The hope is that the new rules will provide independent workers with more chances to sell their products. Cuban entrepreneurs might make more money under the new rules. They could use the money to improve their lives and their communities.

The new rules make it legal for the countries to trade. However, that does not mean it will be simple or easy. The American economy is very large. Working with small private Cuban businesses and entrepreneurs might be difficult at first.

The Cuban government might not be ready to handle the money and products from American customers.

## Lack Of Mail Is A Possible Problem

There are other challenges, too. Right now there is no direct mail service between Cuba and the United States. That could make shipping goods back and forth difficult. Products that are sent to Cuba from the United States now go by boat.

Cuba also has a complicated money system. That could make selling goods to the United States tricky. Cubans use two types of money. The country has a dual-currency system. They use both the Cuban peso and the Cuban convertible peso (CUC). Pesos are used for everyday purchases. CUCs are used by state companies and the government.

Nobody knows how the laws will affect the economy in Cuba. It depends on exactly how the U.S. and Cuba end up trading together.
