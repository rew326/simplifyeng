KAVOUSI, Greece — In June, the digging began again. Slowly but surely, an ancient city lost for thousands of years is being uncovered. The city is in Crete, an island off Greece in the Mediterranean Sea.

Archaeologists — scientists who study ancient peoples — and American students were at the dig. They were there in hopes of discovering clues about life in the city of Azoria. The ancient city was destroyed by fire about 2,500 years ago. Very little is known about it now.

Bits of writing have been found on pottery at the dig. While interesting to see, the writing isn't much help because the language of Azoria has been lost. Clues must be gathered from what remains of the city. The students and archaeologists look at parts of buildings, pots, tools and food.

The project is the life's work of archaeologist Donald Haggis.

## Directing The Digging

Digging is only allowed for six weeks a year, but Haggis has been at it since 2002. A lot of work has already been done.

Today on the hilltop, there are a couple of dozen students and archaeologists. They are busy digging around the remains of several buildings.

"It's fun whacking away," joked student Chelsea Bright, who plans to become an archaeologist. "It's like you're a lumberjack."

So far, several houses and public buildings have been unearthed. Haggis serves as leader, directing the digging.

Azoria was first discovered in 1900, but wasn't considered very important. As a result, no one paid much attention to it for years.

## Ancient Azorian Pottery

But in 1988, Haggis decided that Azoria might be worth a closer look.

What gave Haggis that idea was some Azorian pottery he discovered. The pottery convinced him that the city was much older than people thought it was. He concluded that Azoria would be important to study.

Azoria was a small city, with a population of 2,000 to 5,000 people.

There had been settlements on the mountaintop of Azoria for centuries. However, a full-blown city did not develop until around 630 B.C.

Around 480 B.C., the city was destroyed by a terrible fire, probably set by invaders. Eventually, it became lost in time.

## Olives, Grapes And Grains

Among the discoveries made so far is a building where shared public meals were probably eaten. The building includes dining rooms and kitchens. Storerooms contain the remains of foods: grapes, olives and grains.

The dig has also uncovered something called the Monumental Civic Building. It has a large hall.

It is the first time that two large public buildings of the period have been unearthed. They suggest that many of the men ate together. Perhaps they shared meals because all were soldiers.

Each year, American students — most of them future archaeologists — come to dig at Azoria. This summer, 42 of them are here.

The work the students do is not easy. The sun gets very hot, and they end up covered from head to toe with dirt and dust.

## A Hard Day's Work

Most students start work at 7 a.m. and finish by midafternoon. By then the sun is too hot to work under. Still, the more experienced students work late into the afternoon. Their job is to carefully record the day's findings.

Most students find the work very difficult — but some really enjoy it.

"I love the history and the experience," said student Julie Juhasz. Also, she added, "there is something satisfying about swinging a huge pick."

For those working at the dig, uncovering the past is an exciting experience. Juhasz found that out when she discovered a pot.

Her find made her feel close to the past. It was like being connected to "someone who died 3,000 years ago," Juhasz said.
