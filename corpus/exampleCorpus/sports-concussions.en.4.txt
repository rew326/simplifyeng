A new study has looked at how hits to the head affect college athletes. Athletes may get through the season without a concussion. But they could still show bad changes in their brains, the study shows. A concussion is a bad type of brain injury. It is caused by a hard hit to the head.

Football and ice hockey players may have shown no visible signs of brain injuries. But they still showed changes in how the brain looked. The changes are a reason to worry. The athletes also did worse on brain tests following the season. Athletes in other sports did not have those changes.

A season of small hits may cause the brain to change. Other studies have found almost the same thing. Those brain changes cause problems with memory, mood or the ability to learn years later. None of the single hits are hard enough to send someone to a doctor. But the brain can change from all the hits anyway.

Players may heal after the sports season is over. Scientists are still trying to figure out how easily the brain recovers from injury. They also want to know if there is a point when the damage cannot be reversed.

## Hits Add Up To Damage

The new results don't answer the questions. But they do suggest one thing: repeated blows to the head can cause damage. This even could be true when an athlete is able to get up and keep playing, said Thomas McAllister. He led the study. He is a doctor who treats brain problems.

Finding and managing brain injuries like [concussions](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=concussions) matters, McAllister said. But it may not be enough, he added.

The study looked at 159 students at Dartmouth College. The students played on top teams. They played between 2007 and 2011.

The 80 athletes who played contact sports wore devices in their helmets. Football and hockey are contact sports.

The devices measured the number of blows to the head. They also measured how hard the hits were. The athletes also got MRI brain scans. An MRI takes detailed pictures of the body. The athletes' ability to learn and memorize things was also tested. The MRIs and tests were done before the season. Then they were done again after the season.

The researchers only looked at certain athletes. They were athletes who didn't have brain injuries during the season. Scientists said there were links between blows to the head and changes in parts of the brain. They also found changes in the athletes' ability to learn and memorize things. The changes were there weeks after the season ended.

## Higher Risk Of Concussions?

The scans showed football and hockey players had changes in their brains. The changes were worse than anything seen in the brains of the athletes who played noncontact sports. The changes happened after only one season. The players who had the biggest changes in their brain also showed something else. They did the worst on learning and memory tests after the season was over.

McAllister said there was good news. The brains of contact-sport athletes at the start of their seasons were about the same as that of athletes in noncontact sports. This happened even though they had played their sports for years. So brains of college athletes may get better.

But there could be athletes who don't heal as well. There could also be athletes who have larger problems from small changes in the brain. Those effects could also not show up until later.

Scientists want to find a line for when hits that were safe and hits that caused concussions. But they have not been able to yet.

 And, players may be at higher risk for a concussion after taking several smaller hits.

"We know some of them heal. But some of them don't," said Eric Nauman of Purdue University. Nauman tracks the effects of hits in high school football.
