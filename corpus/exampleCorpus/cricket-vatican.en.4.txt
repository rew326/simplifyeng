VATICAN CITY — The Vatican is the world's smallest country. But it is the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church. On Tuesday, the Vatican served tea and cucumber sandwiches. But the priests weren't meeting to discuss religion. They were there to announce the Vatican's first-ever cricket team.

No, [Pope Francis](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=pope) won't be playing the game himself. He still prefers soccer. And he remains a fan of his beloved San Lorenzo club.

But he and the Vatican have long supported sports. They see them as good for mind, body and soul. The new team will be known as the St. Peter's Cricket Club.

An Australian, John McCarthy, first came up with the idea. He hopes the new team will play the Church of England next fall.

## Interfaith Innings

McCarthy said the idea is to get people from the world's different religions talking. Cricket is very popular in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Perhaps someday the new team will play Muslims or Hindus from those countries.

And, McCarthy added, there was another reason for his idea. He wants to educate Italy, the Vatican and even Pope Francis about something: There is a sport other than soccer!

McCarthy then passed around cucumber sandwiches. These have long been the favorite snack at cricket matches.

The new team will be made up of religious students and priests. It will be fielded as early as the spring. Rome's Capannelle Cricket Club is letting the Vatican use its playing field.

London, England, is the home of cricket. Adam Chadwick of Lord's Cricket Ground welcomed the new Vatican team. And he seemed open to a Vatican versus Church of England match. This, he said, could be played on one of Lord's fields.

## A Sporting Soul

Chadwick admitted that people think of cricket as a game played only by the rich. This idea, he said, dates from the late 19th century. But cricket began very differently: The game was originally played by ordinary people, not by noblemen.

Cricket is enormously popular in places like India. The game caught on in India when it was part of the British Empire. It is still played there by all sorts of people.

So the Vatican wasn't thinking of rich Englishmen. It is interested in cricket because the game is played all over the world. The new cricket team fits in neatly with Pope Francis' aim: He wants the church to reach out to people everywhere. And he wants it to always remember the poor.

The Vatican already has a soccer tournament. This is known as the "Clericus Cup." The Vatican's famed Swiss Guards play various teams made up of religious students.

And just on Sunday, the Vatican organized a "Race of Faith." A 100-meter (328-foot) track was laid down. It ran along the main avenue leading to the St. Peter's Square. St. Peter's Basilica, one of the largest churches in the world, is located there. The idea of the race was to point out that sports are important — even for religion.
