MIAMI â€” Yoani Sanchez writes a popular blog about life in Cuba called Generacion Y. She now plans to open a digital newspaper in just a few weeks.

But the Cuban government may not allow the paper. Because of that, writers at the paper are looking for original ways to get it to their readers. They may send it through text messages and emails. They may also put them on storage devices that can be handed out.

Sanchez spoke about the newspaper at the Hispanicize conference Tuesday in Miami.

The new paper will include news, sports, interviews and reports based on investigations.

## A "Force For Change"

Sanchez won't say the name of the newspaper. But, said she hopes it will launch in late April or early May. Giving out the newspaper's name could be risky in Cuba. The government is run by Raul Castro. It controls all Cuba's newspapers, radio and television stations. And it doesn't always allow businesses to open.

"I have become a journalist on the run," says Sanchez. She believes information can be a "force for change."

The newspaper will be sent mainly through cellphones and emails, she said. Cubans have more cell phones than computers. Just 74 out every 1,000 Cubans owns a computer, says the government. Sanchez also plans to load the newspaper onto USB flash drives, DVDs and CDs. Cubans regularly pass them around hand-to-hand.

The newspaper workers are also working on several backup ways of getting the newspaper to readers. They need ways of getting around the government, Sanchez added. Some papers send articles to people in other countries. Then, those people send them back electronically.

Government officials may give her and her staff a hard time, Sanchez said. The Cuban government may stop the paper from being sent around. She thinks the government may spread lies about the newspaper's workers. Or, the government might give them wrong information to publish.

## A Permit To Be A Typist

Several Cuban journalists have been arrested by the government. They've been accused of "publishing false news against world peace."

Sanchez noted that the Cuban government refuses to give work permits for journalists who work on their own. Journalists who work for TV and newspapers controlled by the government can get permits, however. Sanchez applied for the closest type of work. She got a permit to be a typist. She got laughs when she told people this.

Cuba's government approved a new law over the weekend. It promises to make the country more open to business with other countries. However, Sanchez said she doesn't trust the Cuban government. It has seized the property of business leaders before.

The Cuban government "does not respect" businesses, she said. Sanchez hopes that people in other countries will support tiny Cuban businesses. These businesses are known as "self employment." They could be as small as a single fruit seller.

Having the right to run your own business is important, she said. It's a form of freedom, just like having the right to vote.
