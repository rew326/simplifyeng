Thirty-six years ago the spacecraft Voyager 1 took off from Earth. It has been traveling ever since. It was on its way to leave the solar system. And it finally made it. It is now the first spacecraft to enter deep outer space, or interstellar space.

NASA said on Thursday that Voyager left the solar system. But it actually happened more than a year ago. It took months for scientists to determine that the spaceship actually got to interstellar space.

"Voyager has boldly gone where no probe has gone before," said NASA's John Grunsfeld. It was one of the most important things to ever happen in the history of science, he said.

Scientists studied something called "space plasma density" to find out if Voyager exited the solar system, NASA said. This is a measure of the amount of very small pieces found in gas that comes from our sun and other stars. Those small pieces, or particles, are called electrons.

## Leaving Our Space Bubble

Scientists explained the evidence in a paper. It was published online Thursday in the journal Science.

Don Gurnett said information from the spacecraft showed that Voyager had left the heliopause. This is the bubble of hot pieces of matter that surrounds our sun and planet.

It entered into a region of cold, dark space. The region is called the interstellar medium. Gurnett is an Iowa State scientist who works on the Voyager project. He was the main writer of the paper.

Gurnett said that Voyager crossed the edge of the heliosphere around Aug. 25, 2012. The edge of the heliosphere is called the heliopause.

Scientists started to argue about where Voyager was earlier this year. They could tell that Voyager was being hit by more and more cosmic rays. The number of high-energy pieces from inside the heliosphere had dropped. Cosmic rays are tiny radiation pieces that hit the Earth from space.

## Mystery About Magnetic Fields

But NASA scientists said they could not be certain Voyager had left the solar system. They had to see evidence that magnetic fields around the spacecraft changed direction. They waited for that change for more than a year. Then officials changed their mind. They decided that the magnetic fields did not have to change to show that the spacecraft had left the solar system after all.

"It's a big surprise, and it's another mystery," said Ed Stone, a Voyager project scientist at Caltech. "This is not what our models were telling us. We have to address this issue, but right now ... we don't understand."

One broken piece of Voyager's equipment was the main reason for the confusion. It is called the plasma science experiment, or PLS. The device takes an important measurement.

 It was supposed to show if Voyager had reached the cold plasma found in interstellar space. It broke in 1980.

But voyager does have two antennas. They stretch from its base in a wide V shape. The antennas can tell how fast space plasma particles bounce around, or vibrate. They turn those vibrations into noise. The vibrations also can show if Voyager is traveling through the cold plasma of interstellar space.

## Recording Space Noise

The noise is recorded on Voyager's sound equipment. There were no iPods 36 years ago. The spacecraft uses eight-track tape recorders.

But something has to make the plasma vibrates first. The something can be a large solar flare. Waiting for a solar flare can take years.

Then it can take as long as a year for the flare's shock wave to reach Voyager. The spacecraft is 11.6 billion miles away from the sun.

Fortunately for Voyager scientists, the antennas picked up two long-lasting vibrations. The first was in 2012. The second was in 2013. Both cases suggested that the plasma was cold and dense. Voyager was in interstellar space.

"It was key evidence," Stone said. "We really needed to measure plasma to know if we were inside or outside the heliosphere."

## Voyager 2 Heads Toward Deep Space

Scientists hope that Voyager 2 will answer a lot of questions. The spacecraft was also launched in 1977. It is near the edge of the heliosphere. It is traveling a different path. Voyager 2 is expected to reach interstellar space sometime within the next several years.

Voyager 2 has a working plasma science instrument.

"I think it's going to teach us even more about this region," Stone said.
