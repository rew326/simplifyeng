WASHINGTON â€” U.S. teachers are a lot more likely to be white than their students.

Almost half of public school students are minorities. But fewer than 1 in 5 of their teachers is nonwhite.

Two groups studied the teachers and students by race, the Center for American Progress and the National Education Association (NEA). They want more to be done so that there are more teachers who look like their students.

Teachers are always pushing their students to do better, said Kevin Gilbert. He works for a school district in Mississippi. It works better when the teacher "looks just like them," Gilbert said. "Nothing can help motivate our students more than to see success standing right in front of them." Gilbert is also a leader in the NEA.

## A More Colorful Classroom

Nonwhite students are not the only ones who would be helped by having more minority teachers, said Ulrich Boser. It would even help in places where there are not a lot of minority students, he said. Students need to work with people who are different than them but who can help them, he said. Boser wrote the center's report.

The government said there were about 3.3 million teachers in American public schools in 2012. It said 82 percent were white. Meanwhile, 8 percent were Hispanic and 7 percent were black. About 2 percent were Asian. The numbers include elementary and high schools.

Students are a different story. In 1993, minority students made up just over three-tenths of the public school population; it was more than four-tenths in 2003.

The Center for American Progress says nearly half of the students in public schools are nonwhite. Of those, almost one-quarter are Hispanic. Another one-sixth are black and one-twentieth are Asian. The percentage of minority students is expected to keep going up.

## Get Ready For Changes

Arne Duncan said the majority of U.S. public school students this fall are expected to be nonwhite. It would be the first time that ever happened. Duncan is the U.S. Education Secretary.

Hispanics are now the largest minority group of teachers. The largest minority teacher group used to be blacks. There are also more Hispanic students than blacks in the public school system. Latinos are the largest minority group in the country and the fastest-growing.

Jan Alderson is a high school science teacher in Kansas. She saw the changes at her school.

The school has very few minority teachers, she said. But about four-tenths of the students are minorities. "It's a beautiful blending, it's just teachers who don't have that cultural background." Alderson was entered in the National Teacher Hall of Fame this past week.

## Wanted: More Teachers

Teaching used be one of the only good-paying jobs that African-American college graduates could get, said LaRuth Gray. She works with a group at New York University. Gray tries to improve the quality of education.

Over time, the country integrated, she said. Minorities could get other professional jobs. Education jobs became less attractive and fewer African-American students thought about becoming teachers, she said.

"It's not seen as the ideal career to have," Gray said. She also helps the National Alliance of Black School Educators work with the government.

Supporters say it is going to require willingness from leaders for things to change. Most states already are trying to increase the number of minority teachers. The results have been "disappointing," the NEA report said.
