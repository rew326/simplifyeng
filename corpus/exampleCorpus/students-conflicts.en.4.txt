CHICAGO â€” The trouble started on Facebook. "Do you have a problem with me?" one teenager wrote on the other's page.

Marquita Riley and Aaliyah Hudson ended up in Manley High School's "peace room." By then, things were worse. People in school said that the two girls were going to fight.

Aaliyah did not want a fight. She could get suspended for 10 days. So she went to the peace room. A counselor there could help the girls talk it out.

The girls sat in a circle of chairs. They talked and listened to each other until they solved their problems.

"I came down here and talked before I reacted," Aaliyah said after their visit to the peace room.

## Talking And Listening To Each Other

The peace room at Manley is part of a new program. The goal is to teach people how to solve conflicts. It tries to bring together people who are angry at one another so that they can work through their problems.

The idea is used in schools, churches and other places in Chicago. It teaches young people how to understand their anger and handle problems before violence happens. It is also being used instead of suspensions and arrests.

The idea seems simple. If something bad happens, there needs to be a way to "restore order" said Ilana Zafran. She works for a group that helps set up the program in Chicago schools.

Chicago has had many shootings and killings among youths. Activists, ministers and principals are turning to restorative justice to stop the violence.

Restorative justice makes everybody in an argument talk instead of fight. There may still be punishment for doing something wrong. But the idea is to find out what is upsetting people and think of ways to fix it.

"The assumption is if you are a teenager, you know everything about how to act and behave," Zafran said. "But that's not true."

## Not Easy, But Worth A Try

Supporters admit that it is complicated. It is also difficult to tell if the program is working. But it is worth trying, experts say.

"The idea that if we punish hard enough they won't do it again" has not worked, said the Rev. David Kelly.

Fenger Academy is another Chicago high school that has a peace room. Students, teachers and staff can go there to work out problems.

People who have a problem sit together and can talk about their feelings without being interrupted.

In 2009, a student was killed in a fight at Fenger. After that, the school decided to try the peace room.

Students often talk about gangs when they are in the peace rooms. They talk about problems they have at home.

Before she started high school, Geneva Harris said she called others names. She had a bad attitude. But at Fenger, another student asked why she acted this way.

The other student taught Harris how to work through her problems. Then she also became a person who helps students solve conflicts. Now she pulls her friends and family members into a circle to talk out their problems.

"Now I'm a people person," she said. "I'm like the older sister among my friends."

## Cooling Off Tensions

The Manley High School peace room was busy one recent afternoon. Marquita and Aaliyah were there. They were the two girls who were supposed to be getting ready for a major fight.

"People came up to me and said you wanted to fight me," Marquita said to Aaliyah.

"If you thought I had a problem with you, you could have come to talk to me," Aaliyah told Marquita.

After talking for another 20 minutes, they agreed they had simply misunderstood each other. The girls decided they would not fight. They promised they would talk if they had problems again.
