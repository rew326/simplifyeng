NEW YORK, N.Y. â€” Mozzeria is a restaurant in San Francisco. There is something different about it. Nearly every worker is deaf.

Russ and Melody Stein own Mozzeria. They are deaf. It means they cannot hear. They opened the restaurant four years ago. It is doing really well. People love the food. Also, the Steins succeeded in dealing with special problems. Deaf people are treated unfairly. Business owners who are able to hear do not have these problems.

## Many Deaf People Want To Own Businesses

Tom Baldridge is with Gallaudet University. It is in Washington. It is the largest school serving deaf students and students who do not hear well. He said deaf people want to own their own businesses just like hearing people. They can run them as well.

Melody said she always wanted to own a restaurant.

Russ said they have the same skills as hearing people.

## Hearing People Aren't Used To Deaf Business Owners

There are many deaf people with their own businesses. Hearing people are not used to it. They treat deaf people differently. They might think deaf people cannot have regular jobs. They might think deaf people should only work with other deaf people.

The Steins have been treated unfairly. People said unkind things to them.

Some people made fun of them. Others thought the Steins did not know how to run a restaurant.

The Steins even had trouble opening their restaurant. Government workers did not want to give them permission.

## Customers Are Willing To Help

Their customers are happy to help them. Sometimes, customers want to ask a question. They are willing to write their questions on paper. The Steins will read the questions and answer them. Some customers seem uncomfortable at first. They do not feel comfortable because the Steins cannot hear them. The customers soon relax though. Then, they enjoy their meals.

They are no longer afraid, Melody said.
