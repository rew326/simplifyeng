The poetry from the Syrian war tells stories. The stories are about killing and broken bones. Other stories are about families broken apart.

Syria is a country in the Middle East. People in Syria live in danger because of the war.

## Poems Tell War Stories

The Syrian war began in 2011. More than 200,000 people have been killed. Millions of other people left Syria. The war has become a confusing game. There are air strikes, attacks, and Islamic fighters.

The Syrian writers are doctors, mothers, and others. The writers all tell stories about the suffering in Syria.

Amal Kassir describes her grandmother's farm in a poem. The farm was destroyed by a terrible person. He is a "tyrant" who will die.

## "Tyrant" Wrecks Grandmother's Farm

_My grandmother knows Syria better than anyone._

_She had a farm whose dust she knew by name._

_â€¦ And the tyrant,_

_The dirt is waiting for him._

_He will learn his grave,_

_Feel the weight of the entire country on his chest._

Kassir is 20 years old. She is a Syrian-American student. For Kassir, poetry is important because "there is color and scent and sound involved."

## Writing About A Sniper

A poem shows what is happening with words. Khawla Dunia describes a moment with a sniper. A sniper is a person who kills others with a rifle.

_This moment which joins us:_

_your eye,_

_a bullet,_

_and me_

_It is this moment, then,_

_that unites us._

_It divides me from my dream_

_and gives you your name,_

_Sniper._

## "A Lot Of Courage"

The president of Syria is Bashar Assad. Under his government, many writers were treated poorly. It was hard for them to write against the government. Then the Arab Spring happened in 2011. In the Arab Spring, people had become angry with their leaders. They started protesting governments in the Middle East. It started in a couple of countries. Soon the protests spread across the Middle East.

"We Syrians had been silenced for a very long time," Ghada Alatrash said. She translates poetry into English. After the Arab Spring, Alatrash saw writing that showed "a lot of courage."

The war has been going on for many years now. Many Syrians feel discouraged.

The writing shows the terrible problems that are taking place in Syria, said Alatrash.

## Hip-Hop Song: "We're All Losing"

_Now they say Syria's confusing_

_Can't decide which of the sides_

_They really should be choosing_

_Here's a thought:_

_How 'bout you recognize we're all losing_
