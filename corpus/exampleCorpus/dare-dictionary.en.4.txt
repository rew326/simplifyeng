The 50-year-old Dictionary of American Regional English is in danger of coming to an end. In a few months, money will run out. People could lose their jobs.

The dictionary is often called by its acronym â€” DARE. It has words from different groups across the country. These words come from newspapers, books, maps and many other places.

The dictionary shows the varieties in the English language. There are many different words to explain the same thing. For example, the word dragonfly has 79 words that come from different regions, or locations, in the United States. The dictionary explains America's story. The country is made up of immigrants who came from other countries to live in America. These immigrants brought new words with them. The Irish brought the word brogan, which means a heavy work shoe; the Italians brought vino, a term for wine; the Germans gave us hausfrau for housewife; and the Polish brought over paczki, a filled doughnut.

Finding these words may seem strange, but it can be useful.

## How Is Your Ticklebox?

A couple of months ago, Douglas Kelling, a doctor in North Carolina, was treating an 80-year-old woman. The patient asked: "Doc, how's my ticklebox?" The confused doctor asked what she meant by "ticklebox." "Well, my heart," the woman answered.

The doctor has heard patients use many regional terms for illnesses. But he had never heard this word before. Kelling believes the dictionary is valuable in helping to understand his patients better.

DARE is being worked on at the University of Wisconsin. It finished its final chapters including "Z words" in 2012. A digital dictionary was published in December 2013.

## The Project Is In Danger

For years, DARE has had problems with money, but they always managed to find last-minute donations. But this time, the project will begin its year with less than $100,000. It is a lot less money than it usually needs.

Joan Houston Hall is the head editor of the dictionary. She has spent almost 40 years working on it. Recently, she sent notices to all four of the people who work for DARE that they might lose their jobs. Without more money for the dictionary, she will also lose her job.

"I believe in this project. It has been an important gift to the nation and there is still work to be done," Hall said.

However, right now, people continue to work on the dictionary.

## They Hope The Dictionary Has A Future

Hall looks up the word bittern, which describes a marsh bird. She admires the more than 50 regional choices.

These differences in language show that America is not losing its diversity of words. There are still a lot of different words coming from various parts of the country.

New words are being used in different areas from coast to coast. Hall has discovered that since the dictionary began, people in Wisconsin have begun to change their word for a soft drink.

People used to call it "pop," Hall said. But now, most people call it soda.

Goebel also has been working to make the dictionary more modern. A lot of the information is still kept on paper slips. These slips were collected in the 1960s by DARE workers who were traveling across America, talking to people and learning about new words. Now, Goebel will be putting this information into the computer.

He is doing this to save the dictionary's future, he said. "If there is one. We have to go as if there is."
