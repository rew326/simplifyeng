KANSAS CITY â€” A few years ago, a boy fell during football practice. He was passed out.

"He hadn't eaten in three days," said Brad Deichler. He is a sergeant with the Police Athletic League of Kansas City (PAL). It is a sports program for kids. "He wasn't telling anyone because he didn't want his friends to know."

Officers have known for years that some of the kids are poor. Some live in homes without heat or electricity. Others have parents out of work. Some kids stay on a friend's sofa. They have no where else to sleep. Their parents cannot pay for a house.

After that day on the football field, police knew they had to do more. The officers already knew some kids did not have enough food. Sometimes they gave them food. Yet they did not realize that some kids were starving.

## "Their Only Dinner"

They are now trying to help. The kids in the sports program get a meal after school. The program is five days a week. Sometimes they eat fruit and yogurt. Other times they get a sandwich and chips. They always get milk.

"Sometimes this is their only dinner," said Officer Antoney Perez. He planned for a food bank to bring the food. This way, the kids in the program get at least one good meal a day.

Some kids show up at games to help sell food. They get to eat the food too.

Other programs have seen the need for food shoot up.

The food bank that feeds the kids is called Harvesters. Four years ago, it fed 4,000 children. This year, it fed 7,300 children.

## Coming To The Games

At the police sports league, some kids come and just sit on the bleachers. They are more interested in the food than playing sports.

"I love the chips," said Mark Johnson. He is 10 years old.

In 2010, 1 out of every 4 kids in Kansas City did not have enough to eat at home.

Nicholson-Watson is in charge of the food bank. She said some families have a hard choice. They can pay their rent or pay their heating bills or buy food. They cannot pay for all three.

Often, kids are too embarrassed to say they are hungry.

## Helping A Family

Last year, an officer visited the home of four sports league kids. Their home had no heat or power.

The kids were trying to cook potatoes on a grill outside in the cold.

"That was dinner," Deichler said. Their parents were "fighting in any way they could to put anything on the table for the kids."

Within two hours, PAL brought food for the family. PAL also paid the heating and power bills. The sports league bought the family a new stove to cook. They bought a new furnace to heat the house.

Police still help the boy who passed out on the football field. They gave his family a Thanksgiving dinner. The officers make sure he is doing well.

"There are a lot of hungry kids in this town," Deichler said.

"If nothing else goes right in the day, we make sure the food goes right," Deichler said. "That's the most important thing we do."
