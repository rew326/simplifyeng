TOKYO, Japan â€” Chikara Yamanobe wants to be a sumo wrestler. He has a long way to go. He is so skinny his ribs stick out. He sometimes cries when he is pushed in the sumo ring.

Chikara is also only 5 years old.

Sumo is a Japanese sport. In sumo, two wrestlers try to push each other out of a ring.

"I want to be like Endo," said Chikara. Endo is a Japanese sumo star.

## Many Kids Are Not Interested Anymore

It is not likely Chikara will make it.

Sumo is not as popular as it used to be. Boys have lost interest in the sport. They like baseball and soccer better.

Sumo used to be a very Japanese sport. Now, sumo wrestlers come from all over the world. In a sumo contest this month, none of the winners were Japanese. The grand champion came from Mongolia. It is a country near China.

There are a lot of reasons why many Japanese are not interested in Sumo. Some old things are not as popular. Also, the life of a sumo wrestler is hard. Young sumo wrestlers must leave school at 15. They must live in a special training center. They have to follow many rules. They are told how to wear their hair and what to eat. Sumo wrestlers must eat a lot, too. In sumo, the best wrestlers are really heavy.

Mike Wesemann is an American. He runs a blog about sumo wrestling.

There is just nothing cool about sumo anymore, he said.

## But This Boy Picks His Sumo Name

Sumo officials know this.

Noboru Yoshimura is the head of the Japanese Sumo Federation. He said kids are not choosing to learn sumo.

In 1994, 70,000 kids took part in a children's sumo tournament. In 2014, it got just 33,000 kids.

Sumo students are almost always boys. For many years, girls were not allowed in the ring.

Hisao Yoshiyoka has two sons learning sumo. Through sumo, they learn about Japanese life, she said.

Her youngest son is 7. His name is Ryudai. He has already chosen his sumo wrestler name. He wants to be called Dairyu. So maybe you'll see a grand champion named Dairyu in 2030.
