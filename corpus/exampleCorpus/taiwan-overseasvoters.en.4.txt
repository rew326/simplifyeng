LUKANG, Taiwan — Japan ruled parts of China from 1931 to 1945\. Kenneth Wang's father worked in an important job in the Japanese government in Taiwan. It is an island off of China. After China took back Taiwan, China took revenge on Taiwanese who worked for the Japanese. The Chinese government killed thousands of people. One of them was Wang's father.                       

Wang left Taiwan and moved to California in the 1960s.

This week, Wang returned to Taiwan. He belongs to a group called Friends of Tsai Overseas. All the members were born in Taiwan and now live in America. They are called overseas Taiwanese. They are supporting Tsai Ing-wen for president. The overseas Taiwanese came to vote for Tsai in Saturday's election. They are excited to be part of their old country.

## Hoping To Make Political Change

On Tuesday afternoon, Wang and other members of the group stood by the road in Lukang. It is a town in western Taiwan. They were waiting to cheer on Tsai. Her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) probably will win the election. Right now, another group is in control. They are called the Nationalists. They have been in power since 1949.

The overseas Taiwanese are excited for the change. Taiwanese leaders say these overseas people are very important. They give much help to candidates who are running for president. They go to election events. They cheer the candidates. The overseas group has been attending two to three election events each day.

The Friends of Tsai Overseas group supported other DPP candidates, too. They supported Chen Wen-bin. He is running for Parliament, which makes laws for the government. Parliament is similar to the Congress in the United States. The group cheered for him. "Dong suan!" they chanted in Mandarin. It is the language in Taiwan and China. It means "Get elected!"

## Pushing For Independence From China

Chen said he likes seeing all the overseas Taiwanese. It is like a family coming back together.

China had a civil war from 1927 to 1949\. Two sides of the country fought against each other. The Chinese Communist group kept control of China. The Nationalist group ruled in Taiwan. Each side says it is the real ruler of all of China.

The Communists says that Taiwan and the mainland are one country and "one China." Many Taiwanese people want Taiwan to completely separate. They say Taiwan should be a different country.

Chen said it is important that the overseas Taiwanese vote. The Taiwanese living in America have an important voice. They can get other countries to support Taiwan.
