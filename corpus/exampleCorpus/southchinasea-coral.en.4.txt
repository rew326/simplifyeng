BEIJING â€” China is building islands in the South China Sea. The government hopes the islands will help the country gain power. However, building islands may hurt the environment. People are especially concerned about the sea's coral reefs.

The South China Sea is located between China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei. The sea is home to many different types of fish and marine life. The reefs are very shallow. Fish swim around the shallow areas and live in the coral. There are currently many reefs in the South China Sea. Without the reefs, many fish would also disappear.

Youna Lyons and Wong Hiu Fung work at the University of Singapore. They study the reefs and the islands in the South China Sea. They believe China is hurting the reefs in the South China Sea.

## China Wants To Own It All

The process of making new islands is called dredging. China digs up sand from the bottom of the ocean. Then, experts believe China is dumping the sand on top of the reefs. If this is true, the underwater life is in danger.

China has already created 1.5 square miles of man-made land. For many countries, more land can mean more power. This might help explain why China is building more islands. The nations in the area all want control of the South China Sea. Having control of the sea can protect a country and help with trade. One challenge is that all the countries that border the South China Sea can say that part of the water is theirs. China wants to own the entire sea.

Ouyang Yujing works for a Chinese government group. He said it is not against the law for China to build islands using dredging.

## New Islands Serve Many Purposes

China uses the islands for many different things. The islands can help China in an important way. China sends its people to work on the islands.

The people can keep others safe and rescue anyone in danger. Also, workers can do science experiments, study the weather and watch for pirates while staying on the islands. The islands help China protect its mainland as well.

Yujing said the country is very serious about the dredging and is careful. He said the government studied the environment around the land and sea.

## Humans Cause A Lot Of The Damage To Reefs

Still, the reefs are in danger. Humans are responsible for a lot of the problem. Chemicals in the air can be a threat to reefs and coral. There is a lot of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere around China. The carbon dioxide is killing the coral. China also blames fishing boats from other countries nearby for causing damage to the reefs.

Haiwen said it is normal for countries to build islands in this way. She said China is following all of the international rules.
