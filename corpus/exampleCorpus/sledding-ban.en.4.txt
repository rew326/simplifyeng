Ten-year-old Wesley Pope shot down the hill on his sled.

"Keep going, son!" his father Russell yelled. "Have fun."

The Popes live in Overland Park, Kansas. There has been very little snow in their city all winter. Last week, they finally got a chance to go sledding.

In other parts of the country too little snow is not the only problem. Something else has been keeping many kids from sledding: the law.

Many cities these days are passing laws against sledding.

## Maybe Wearing Helmets Will Help

Dubuque, Iowa, is the latest city to do that. In January, sledding was not allowed in almost all of Dubuque's parks. People who try to sled anyway will have to pay a $750 fine." Other cities have not gone that far. Some are banning sledding only on the most dangerous hills. Others are making sledders wear helmets.

Sledding is risky, said Dubuque's city lawyer. "It's not unusual for people to talk about their accidents or near accidents."

Thousands of kids have sledding accidents each year. Some of those accidents are very serious.

## People Will Sled Anyway

Some cities have had a hard time banning sledding.

Omaha, Nebraska, outlawed sledding at a popular hill. People simply ignored the new law. The city then decided to drop it.

Instead, the city posted warning signs. It put bundles of hay around trees and pads around posts.

Overland Park has also tried to make sledding safer. Padding is being put in front of possibly dangerous things. On Monday, hay bundles were in front of streetlights near the sledding hill.

Russell Pope said he appreciates the added safety. However, he hopes Overland Park will never ban sledding.

The safety of kids is the most important thing for parents, he said. However, some fun things are worth taking a bit of a chance.

"You can't take all the joy out of being a kid," he said. If kids "don't go sledding in the winter, all you've got is your iPad and SpongeBob. I'd rather they get out there and get some exercise."

## Parks Are Safer For Sledding

Some say the new ban in Dubuque has made sledding more dangerous there. The city has many steep streets. Kids may decide to sled down them if they are kept out of parks.

"Parents ought to be getting out there yelling," said law professor Craig Lawson. The city has "made sledding more dangerous" for kids.

Indeed, children who sled on the street are much more likely to be hurt.

Dubuque's sledding ban has led to many protests. For example, two grownup brothers slid down a hill holding signs. The words "Don't tread on my sled!" were written on one sign.

Eleven-year-old Lydia Pope said she agrees with her father. She also hopes sledding will not be banned in Overland Park.

"I wouldn't like it," she said. "Sledding is what you do when there is snow!"
