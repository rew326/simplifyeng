JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — Jennifer Kavanaugh has been a teacher for 13 years. During that time, she never dreamed of hitting a child — not even once.

Kavanaugh is now a fifth-grade teacher. She teaches at St. Margaret of Scotland School in St. Louis.

She used to teach at a school where corporal punishment was used. That means kids who misbehaved were punished with a spanking.

Kavanaugh never used corporal punishment herself — but she knows there are teachers across the state who do. She wants it stopped.

Corporal punishment does not work, she said. It "does not make for a more peaceful, happier child."

## Already Banned In Some Districts

Recently, Kavanaugh and about 30 of her fifth-grade students attended a meeting. It had been called to discuss a bill that would outlaw school spankings in Missouri. A bill is sort of a test-run for a new law. If it passes a vote, it becomes a real law. This particular bill was introduced by State Senator Joe Keaveny.

"We need to stop" hitting "our kids," Keaveny said.

Missouri is one of 19 states that still allows spanking in schools. The latest states to outlaw it were New Mexico in 2011 and Ohio in 2009.

Many Missouri school districts still allow spanking. In 2009, at least 70 did. A school district usually contains at least several schools, so that's a lot of schools.

However, many districts in the St. Louis area do not permit it. These include St. Louis itself, Clayton, Lindbergh and Riverview Gardens.

The Ferguson-Florissant district does not allow it either. District officials believe there are better ways to react to bad behavior. They range from calling in parents to suspending or expelling students.

But some districts do allow the practice. About 4,200 students across the state were spanked or physically punished in the 2009-2010 school year.

The Fox School District in Jefferson County used to allow spanking. In the early 2000s, however, it changed its rules.

The district "no longer sees it as a proper way to punish kids," district official Lorenzo Rizzi said. Spanking "doesn't change behavior," he said. Often, it just makes things worse.

## Bill Includes Private Schools

The move away from spanking is happening across the country. During the 2009-2010 school year, about 184,500 students were physically punished. Four years earlier, the number was greater: about 223,000 students.

A decrease, however, is not enough for Kavanaugh. She wants to see teachers switch their whole approach. She thinks they should be rewarding students for good behavior. That, she thinks, works better than punishing them for bad behavior.

"We need to" ask "more of teachers," she said.

No one spoke against the bill at Wednesday's meeting. However, state Senator Gina Walsh has problems with it. She thinks including private schools in the bill is a bad idea. Walsh attended Catholic school as a child.

"I do not support corporal punishment," she said. "But my parents sent me to a faith-based school … I'm opposed to government" telling such schools what to do.

State Senator Jolie Justus supports the bill. Still, she agrees there could be a problem when it comes to private schools.

"I suspect we'll hear from people who don't want" the state interfering in private schools, Justus said. "At some point, we may need" to make some changes. "Right now, I haven't heard" from anyone who's against it.
