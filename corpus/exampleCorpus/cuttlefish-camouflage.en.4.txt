Sometimes engineers get their ideas from strange places. 3-D printing and cuttlefish don't seem to share anything in common. However, engineers have created a new 3-D printing process. They were inspired by the cuttlefish, which is not really a fish. It is a sea animal related to the octopus. Cuttlefishes have large, stretchy bodies. They have tentacles around their mouths.

3-D printing is a new way to make things with full shapes. Older printers could only make objects that were 2-D. They were just flat, two-dimensional objects. Now, 3-D printers can make things that have a shape. First, an object is designed on a computer. Then the design is sent to a 3-D printer. 3-D printers can turn plastic into objects of any shape. These printers are creating objects from necklaces to airplane engines.

3-D printers used to make only hard objects, like car parts. Now engineers have created a new printing process. It can be used to print soft objects. This ability could change many businesses.

Mark Guttag is the engineer who designed the new printing process. "This project was originally about camouflage," Guttag said.

## Playing Hide-And-Seek

His inspiration came from cuttlefish. They can blend into the surroundings and camouflage themselves. It helps them hide from predators. They hide by changing the color of their skin. They can also change the surface of their skin. They even can change how it feels. That is what the engineers wanted to copy.

Guttag wanted to learn how to copy the cuttlefish. Another engineer named Mary Boyce worked with him on the project.

The engineers developed a 3-D printing process. It uses polymers. Polymers are the tiny pieces that make up plastics. Polymers are used in many materials.

## Hard And Soft Squeezed Together

The engineers used hard and soft polymers. The 3-D printer puts the hard polymers inside the soft polymers. Then the two are squeezed. The engineers found that the smooth surface of the soft polymers becomes similar to the hard polymer. The hard polymer can be smooth, bumpy or rough. This can make the soft polymer become smooth, bumpy or rough. When the two polymers are no longer squeezed, the material returns to its smooth surface.

Shengqiang Cai is an engineer at the University of California in San Diego. He was not part of the cuttlefish study. Still, he is very interested in what the engineers did. It was "inspiring," he said. Cai thinks it could help engineers make lots of new, interesting materials. It will also help us to understand how animals like cuttlefish change their patterns, he thinks.

The new printing process is useful in other ways, too. It can make an object move through the air more easily. It can even make some objects waterproof. This new type of 3-D printing could help many businesses.
