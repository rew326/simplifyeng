WASHINGTON â€” In 1961, the United States ended its friendship Cuba.

On Wednesday, the United States said the two countries will begin fixing their relationship.

Cuba is an island less than 100 miles from Florida. The United States cut off contact two years after communist leader Fidel Castro grabbed power. Castro said communism would make everyone equal. In reality, there is little freedom.

At the time, the U.S. government worried about a communist country so close to America. It did not want communism spreading to the United States.

## An American Is Set Free

The news of beginning to talk again comes after the release of Alan Gross from a Cuban jail. Gross is an American who has been in a Cuban jail for five years. Cuba said he brought cellphones and computers into Cuba, which is against the law.

Gross, who is 65 years old, has already been sent home. Cuba and the United States spoke secretly for a year about freeing him.

Gross' family in Maryland said he is in bad health. He is weak and can barely walk. In Cuba, he had refused medical care, food and visits from American officials. He was protesting being kept in jail.

The United States made a deal with Cuba. Gross will be released. In exchange, the United States will free three Cubans. The Cubans were arrested in 1998 for spying. They were asked to spy on anti-Castro groups in Florida. The state is home to many Cubans who came to the United States because they did not like Castro.

## Change Can Be Good

The United States plans to send an ambassador to Cuba. The ambassador would be the official U.S. representative in Cuba. Countries with normal relations exchange ambassadors.

The United States will also start talks on other things that divide the two nations. Under law, American companies cannot do business with Cuba. They also cannot sell American products there. Travel to Cuba is also limited. Lawmakers passed a trade and travel ban. They wanted to pressure Cuba to end communism.

This "will create a force for positive change," said Dick Durbin. He is a lawmaker from Illinois. Ignoring Cuba did nothing positive, Durbin said.

Legally, only Congress can end the trade ban on Cuba. President Obama can use his powers as president to help, though. He can try to begin a normal relationship. Enemies of Castro are likely to oppose it. Florida lawmakers are also likely to object.

## The Countries Are Ready To Talk

For many years, speaking with Cuba would have been unpopular for a president. Experts say it is safer now. Times have changed. Many in the Cuban-American immigrant community do not feel as strongly about it. Also, it seems that the trade ban has not achieved its goal. Communism is as strong as ever in Cuba.

No top U.S. official believes the trade ban will make Cuba more free, said Gregory B. Craig. He used to be a White House lawyer.

Originally, five Cuban spies were caught in 1998. Two of the five already finished serving their jail time and returned home. In Cuba, they are called heroes and "freedom fighters." Cuba says they were unfairly put in jail by the United States.

Cuba has not yet released its thoughts. Cuban President Raul Castro will speak soon about the relationship between the United States and Cuba. He is the brother of Fidel Castro, who is very sick.
