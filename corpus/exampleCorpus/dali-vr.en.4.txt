There is new show at an art museum in Florida. Visitors will not just look at art. They will feel like they are stepping inside a painting. They will use virtual reality (VR). VR is a make-believe world created by computers.

The show is about two friends. Salvador Dali was a famous artist. Walt Disney started Disneyland. He made many animated movies. Walt died 50 years ago. Salvador died 26 years ago. 

Visitors will see and hear a lot about the two friends. Paintings, stories, letters and photos will tell the story. Then they will put on a VR headset.  

## Both Men Liked Same Things

The VR takes users inside one of Salvador's paintings. People can move around. They can see huge stone people. There are elephants in a desert. People can fly up a stone tunnel. They can hear music and birds. 

Jeff Goodby helped make the VR. No one has experienced anything like this before, he said. No one has felt like they are inside of a painting. 

Hank Hine runs the museum. He said Disney and Dali met in Hollywood, California in 1940\. They liked the same things. Both loved art. Both wanted to help bring art into the world. Walt Disney loved pretty castles. There are many castles all around Disneyland. Salvador liked to build giant art. One piece was as big as a building. It looked like a dream world. There was even a swimming pool inside. After that, many other artists created the same kind of giant art projects.

## Visitors Can Watch Movie

Disney and Dali worked on a short animated movie. It was called "Destino." The six-minute movie is on YouTube. It shows a dancing girl with long dark hair. People can also watch the movie at the museum.

Kathy Greif works at the museum. Many people love Disney and want to try VR. She thinks many visitors will come to the show.
