LYNCHBURG, Va. â€” Senator Ted Cruz announced he is running for president on Monday. Cruz is a Republican from Texas. He is the first politician to officially announce himself as a candidate for the 2016 race.

"Today, I am announcing that I am running for president of the United States," Cruz said to students in a speech. He was speaking at Liberty University.

"Ted! Ted!" students yelled.

"It is the time for truth. It is the time for liberty," Cruz said in his speech.

## Getting Many People To Join In

The candidate talked about his parents and their humble backgrounds. Cruz's father was from Cuba. His wife's parents were missionaries. Her parents lived in other countries where they worked to spread Christianity.

The speech spoke to many different groups within the Republican Party: Christians with traditional values, people who support the military, and voters who want a smaller government. Cruz wants to get young people to join his campaign. It is why he chose to make his speech at a university.

One of Cruz's advisers said he wants to unite different types of conservatives. He wants to get them all behind his campaign. But Cruz still plans to stand up to political parties. Cruz is known as someone who will not change his beliefs. Cruz has pushed to end the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's health care law. He is against the Common Core education standards. He has also said he doubts the Earth is getting warmer. That idea is known as global warming, or climate change.

## Looking For Voters

Cruz had already announced his plan to run with a tweet Monday morning. Then he made the speech at Liberty. He made it clear that he wants young people and evangelical Christians to vote for him.

"I'm running for president, and I hope to earn your support!" he wrote just after midnight. His tweet made him the first major candidate to enter the race. Many other Republicans are thinking about it. However, none have announced it.

On Monday, Cruz said it in person, at the ceremony at Liberty University.

"We stand together for liberty!" Cruz said. "This is our fight. The answer will not come from Washington ... (It will come) when the American people stand together, and say, 'We will get back to the principles that made this country great.'"

The student audience screamed like a crowd at a concert. Cruz also got loud applause when he mentioned Patrick Henry, a patriot of the American Revolution from Virginia. They cheered at the idea of shutting down the Internal Revenue Service, the government agency that collects taxes.

They booed loudly when Cruz mentioned President Obama's health care law.

## Getting In Early

Cruz's announcement means the 2016 race is about to heat up. By announcing early, Cruz can grab the spotlight. Others will say later that they will also run to try to be the Republican Party candidate. Some of the likely competitors include Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and doctor Ben Carson. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania may also run. Both are popular among evangelical Christians.

Cruz, who is 44 years old, worked as a lawyer. He has degrees from Harvard and Princeton. He is best known for trying to block Obama's health care law from going into effect in 2013. His efforts included a 21-hour-long speech on the Senate floor. Such a long speech is called a filibuster.

## Time To Buy Ads

Cruz's campaign wants to raise $40 million to $50 million for the primary race. In the primary, he will go up against other Republicans. The winner of the primary will be in the national election against other candidates. The other candidates will come from different political parties, like the Democrats. The Cruz campaign is already buying online advertising. It hopes to get more people familiar with Cruz's name in other states before the primary elections.

Cruz has talked about getting donations from average people. He will also be asking for money from rich people who supported him in Congress.

Cruz lives in Houston with his wife and two young daughters. His wife, Heidi, works for a large bank. She will take time off to campaign with her husband.
