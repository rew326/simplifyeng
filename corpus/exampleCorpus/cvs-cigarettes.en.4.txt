WASHINGTON â€” CVS Caremark will stop selling cigarettes. CVS is the first national drugstore company to end cigarette sales. It made the important announcement on Wednesday.

Health experts have pushed CVS to take this step. They especially oppose promoting cigarettes to children and teens.

CVS will lose about $2 billion that it could have made selling cigarettes.

The drugstore will stop selling cigarettes on Oct. 1. It also won't sell cigars and chewing tobacco. The company has about 7,600 stores nationwide. It is the second largest drugstore company in the country. Only Walgreen Co. is larger.

## Announces Anti-Smoking Effort

Larry Merlo is the president of CVS. He said CVS wants keep people healthy. Selling cigarettes goes against this goal.

CVS also will start a national anti-smoking effort.

Health experts are happy with CVS.

"This is a bold step," said Dr. Risa Lavizzo-Mourey. She is a health expert. She called CVS a leader. She said it will make the country healthier.

Smoking is unhealthy. Smoking can cause cancer and heart disease. Since 1965, the number of smokers dropped by more than half.

Experts want fewer stores to sell cigarettes. They want to people to quit smoking.

## Hard To Quit Smoking

Smoking "is a hard habit to break," said Robin Koval. She is a health expert. It's hard to quit if you are in a store that sells cigarettes, Koval said.

Dr. Troyen Brennan is CVS's chief doctor. He says cigarettes shouldn't be sold in drugstores. It sends the wrong message. People think cigarettes can't be bad if they can be bought in the same place as medicine.

Other companies have made similar moves. Starbucks doesn't let people smoke near its coffee shops. People can't smoke inside either.

Target stopped selling cigarettes almost 20 years ago. The company said it didn't make much money from cigarettes. People stole them. Also, people under 18 can't buy cigarettes in most states.
