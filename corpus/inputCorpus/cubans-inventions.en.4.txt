MIAMI — People in Cuba don't have very much. But they've figured out how to do a lot with what they do have.

They poke holes in the bottom of a water bottle. Presto, it's a shower head.

They roast hot dogs and hamburgers on a metal chair. They use raw eggs to plug leaks. To stop oil drips, they get out a bar of soap.

People may think that Cubans are really smart, said Ernesto Oroza. Born in Cuba, Oroza has collected the inventions since the mid-1990s. He now lives in Miami.

They have learned to make what they need with whatever they happen to have, he said.

Since the early 1960s, Cubans have been "resolviendo." In Spanish, it means "making do."  In 1958, Cuban leader Fidel Castro took over the Cuban government. The U.S. did not like Castro. It decided to punish him. The government stopped U.S. companies from doing business with Cuba.

Cuba couldn't buy goods from the U.S. It wasn't allowed to buy everything from building materials to car parts. So Cubans learned to make do.

## From Dangerous To Very Smart

Castro had some ideas that failed. In 1987, he suggested breeding cows down to the size of dogs. He thought families could keep them in their back yards. Then children could drink the cow's milk. That was another thing Cuba didn't have enough of — milk.

Some of the inventions were dangerous.

They heated water for showers with electric wires connected to cans.

Other inventions were very smart.

An iron turned upside down became a frying pan. Paper clips held up a shower curtain. A 55-gallon metal container became a pizza oven. Cubans even figured out how to recharge batteries that are not chargeable.

Women used colored classroom chalk as face powder.

There was even a group that encouraged the inventions.

In 1991, the Cuban army and a women's group printed a book on "making do."

A year later, they did a second book. They proudly called it "With Our Own Efforts."
