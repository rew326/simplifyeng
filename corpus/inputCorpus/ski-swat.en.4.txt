MALAM JABBA, Pakistan — Boys bomb down the powdery slopes of Malam Jabba. They wear tattered coats and homemade pine skis. Their ski boots are galoshes nailed to the planks. Bamboo sticks stand in for ski poles.

Nearby, jobless men climb a snowy ridge. They are seeking scrap metal in the rubble. This was once a ski resort  -– the only one in all of Pakistan. People called it "the Switzerland of Pakistan." The rich and powerful used to come here to enjoy the rugged peaks.

## Taliban Terror

Malam Jabba is in the scenic Swat Valley. In 2008 Taliban fighters seized the valley. The Taliban was brutal. The fighters killed anyone they believed to be their enemy. They burned down schools and banned girls from attending classes.

The militants said skiing was against their religion. The resort hotel was set on fire. They destroyed its chairlift, snow-making machine and ski-rental shops.

The government regained control of the valley in 2009. However, Malam Jabba is barely back in business. It is a symbol of Pakistan's struggle to win back tourism.

In October, the Taliban tried to kill 15-year-old Malala Yousafzai. She was targeted because she promotes education for girls. When Malala was shot, it raised fears that the Taliban would bring more violence to the Swat Valley.

## Still Waiting For Help

"The government has been telling us for years that they're going to rebuild the hotel, and it never happens," said Sabz Ali. The 18-year-old was climbing up the slope with his skis over his shoulder. His family owns a small hotel nearby. The hotel only makes about $20 a month. "The [big] hotel is the main thing. If they build it, people will come."

Pakistan tourism has an image problem. People are afraid it is just a land of religious extremists and car bombers. But it is home to the world's second-highest peak, K2. It has ancient ruins and giant cliff sculptures.

Swat Valley was the crown jewel of Pakistani tourism. Its velvet-green mountainsides drew visitors. The winding Swat River has the best trout fishing in the country. And then there is Malam Jabba, Swat's own little Aspen.

## Heartbreak Hotel

The resort used to host thousands of people each day; now, the number is usually in the dozens. The ruined hotel was a striking, white, modern building with a curved roof. It was different from the typical boxy buildings found in Pakistan. Inside the lobby were fireplaces, wood panels and dark red carpeting. Guests could skate on the ice rink after skiing. A souvenir shop sold jars of honey made in Swat.

"It was a beautiful, huge hotel, and it was always full," Ali said. He and his family fled Swat during the fighting. They returned four months later to find the hotel destroyed. "When I saw it, my heart sank. It was so beautiful, but it also meant we had jobs."

## Tourists Remain Wary

The military is still guarding Swat. Bases and checkpoints ensure that the Taliban doesn't return. "Swat is now totally cleared of the Taliban," said Syed Aqil Shah, tourism minister for the Swat Valley. "What happened to Malala was just one incident that made people start talking again about Swat security.

"But I assure you that Swat is as safe as any other place in Pakistan right now."

Nonetheless, tourism is not what it used to be.

About 50,000 tourists visit Swat per year, said Zahid Khan. He is the president of the All-Swat Hotels Association. Before the Taliban takeover there were 300,000 visitors a year. Almost everyone in Swat earned a living from tourism. The drop in visitors has hurt nearly everyone Khan said. Hotel workers, cooks, taxi drivers and souvenir makers are all losing money.

According to Khan, nobody in the government is helping. His requests to meet with top officials get ignored, he said. So are his pleas for funding.

## More Bad Luck for Swat

Making matters worse, the valley was flooded in 2010. More than 120 hotels in Swat were damaged or destroyed. Only 20 have been rebuilt.

The local government said reconstruction of the hotel should begin this summer. People in Swat say they have heard such promises before. They are just scraping by.

## Skiing Against All Odds

The resort still brings some joy to residents. Skiing is all they have to fill their days. On a recent cloudless afternoon, a few dozen people spent hours on the mountain doing jumps. One skier in an overcoat whizzed down without poles.

"It's such a beautiful sport that I can't help but ski every day," said Saeed Alam, 22. He pushed off down the slope. On the back of his jacket were the words "Ski and Smile in Swat!"
