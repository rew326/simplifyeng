On the island of Cuba there are road signs pointing to a turnoff for Camilo Cienfuegos City. But there is no city with that name.

"AIR-shee" is what everyone still calls it. Hershey.

The town was founded by U.S. chocolate company owner Milton Hershey in 1916. Today, most of it is in ruins. The huge sugar mill was once one of the best in the world. Now, it looks like it was blasted by a bomb.

## Revolution Changed Things

In 1959, a man named Fidel Castro led a revolution in Cuba. He started a communist government.

In the communist system, there are no businesses owned by any single person. Instead, the government owns the businesses. People from United States who had businesses in Cuba had to leave.

This was a big deal for towns like Hershey. The town survived because of American companies.

## Cuba's Chocolate Town Grew

The history of the town is complicated.

Milton Hershey arrived in Cuba in the early 1900s. Land was cheap, and Cuba needed help after a war. Many Americans thought business would solve Cuba's problems.

Hershey chose to build an all-American town in the sugar cane fields on Cuba's northern coast. He also built schools, health centers and housing for his workers.

The town was doing well. There were so many Hershey chocolate bars and Hershey's Kisses that they would go bad and the shopkeepers would just throw them away.

Milton Hershey died in 1945. Before he did, he left instructions to sell the property in Cuba. That was a wise idea.

The next owner of the Hershey mill and sugar cane field was Julio Lobo, one of the richest men in Cuba.

Lobo wanted to save money. So, he reduced the number of jobs at the mill and closed the main cafeteria in town. The cafeteria had been a place that offered food at prices all Cubans could pay.

## Some People Have Hope

When the new Castro government took over, it made the Hershey mill the property of the Cuban government. The town cafeteria was reopened and a sign was hung outside that said "Thanks to the Revolution."

The town and its mill were renamed for Camilo Cienfuegos, a hero of the Cuban revolution. But people never used the new name.

The mill closed for good in 2003. The government retrained some of the workers for other jobs. But many people left Hershey to live in other cities.

The town's heart, its purpose for existing, was gone.

Elis de Cary Rojas moved back to the town with her young daughter a few years ago. She likes its peace and quiet and space. She prefers it to living in a tiny city apartment.

Still, it does feel sad there, Rojas said. "There's nothing here, no playgrounds, no parks, no ice-cream shop," she said. "But it doesn't have to be this way. It's still a beautiful place."

She has heard a new rumor that the Hershey company wanted to return. Or maybe it was Julio Lobo's family.

It did not matter. Rojas is 23. She said she just wants someone — anyone — to bring the town back to life.
