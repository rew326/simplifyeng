In Earth's history there have been five moments when much of the planet's life has died. They were mass extinctions. Natural events caused the first five. An asteroid killed the dinosaurs. Volcanoes may have caused the Great Dying. It wiped out nearly everything on land or sea.

Altogether, the five mass extinctions killed off three quarters of the planet's life. The sixth mass extinction may now be starting. This time it isn't nature's fault. It is ours.

For hundreds of years we have burned fossil fuels, like oil, coal and natural gas. It changed the climate. Humans use more than half of the planet's land for cities, wood or food. Our actions destroyed the natural environment of animals and plants.

## Hunting Too Many Animals

Humans have existed for 200,000 years on Earth. Scientists say we have made about 1,000 species extinct. Early humans hunted the biggest animals like woolly mammoths, giant kangaroos and giant sloths. We drove them to extinction. Since the year 1500, we have killed off at least 322 types of animals. The passenger pigeon and the Tasmanian tiger are all gone. Most recently, a freshwater dolphin in China called the baiji was wiped out.

Five million animal species are left on the planet. About one third of them are either threatened or endangered, says a new study in Science magazine.

Scientists aren't sure how quickly it's happening. Maybe that's because tiny insects are most of what's dying out. The study in Science says their numbers fell by half in just the past 35 years. At the same time, humans have doubled in population. Other studies say species are becoming extinct 1,000 times faster than usual.

The biggest animals, like elephants, tigers, and whales, are in the most danger.

## To The Rescue!

It's not too late. Humans have already rescued some species. The black-footed ferret was brought back from just seven left. Condors have been nursed back through medicine and raised by hand. Another new study in Science said that people have moved 424 species of plants and animals to protect them from extinction.

Fishes can bounce back when we stop overfishing. Salmon in Washington state already have. When we stop farming too much, woods grow back. Then coyotes, deer, turkey and other wildlife return. Animals and plants in the Amazon rain forest do better now that Brazil cuts down fewer trees there.

We could learn from India. Scientists say that 20 out of 21 large mammals in India have survived. Leopards and deer are among them. For the past 100,000 years, they've lived alongside humans.

## People Can Still Change Course

Our climate is changing. Endangered species could be moved to save them. Species like wolves or beavers have left their old ecosystems. They could be brought back. Some species have entered new areas and caused problems. Asian carp have invaded lakes in the U.S., eating everything. They may need to be killed to save other plants and animals.

In some cases new animals could be brought in. They could replace extinct animals. For example, European sailors ate their way through the Indian Ocean islands of Mauritius. They killed off the dodo bird and local turtles. But turtles nearby have been brought in. They helped bring back the island ecosystem.

There is even some hope of bringing back extinct species in the future. Biology and genetics could make it possible. Yet bringing back extinct species could cause problems for ones now. It could be like the Asian carp problem. We have to be careful.

But a sixth mass extinction can be avoided. A study in Nature magazine in 2011 said we have 100 to 200 years before we might cause a mass extinction. Unlike an asteroid, we can change course.
