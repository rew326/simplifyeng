Rinehart first noticed the problem five years ago. He saw brownish spots on his apples and peaches. Rinehart thought the fruit was low in calcium. But spraying the fruit with calcium didn't help.

University of Maryland scientists cut open his fruit and examined it. Then it became clear that the problem was stink bugs. The bugs are more damaging to fruit than a lack of calcium. They are also more unpredictable.

Rinehart owns Rinehart Orchards in Maryland. He said stink bugs damage between one tenth and one fifth of his crop every year.

"They are a major, major issue in our orchards." Rinehart said. "It's nothing that you can take lightly."

## "Surviving The Winter"

The stink bugs do not belong here. They came to North America in the late 1990s. The bugs caused bad damage in 2010 and 2011. Some Maryland growers are still dealing with damage from stink bugs. The problem can almost ruin the worth of a fruit crop, Rinehart said. But others have seen damage ease.

Stink bugs pierce fruit with their mouths and suck sugar out. The damage may have decreased since 2010 and 2011. But there's no reason to believe the insect is going away, said Gerry Brust. He is an expert in pest management.

"That's what insect populations do. It goes up, down," he said.

Even extreme weather won't get rid of the bugs. So the record low temperatures in many parts of the nation this winter are not solving the problem.

Stink bugs can escape the cold by living in places like dead or rotting trees, said Donald Weber. He studies bugs for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

"They're perfectly capable of surviving the winter," Weber said.

## Scientists Test Samples

Rinehart said he has to look hard for stink bug damage. He can spray something to keep the bugs away. The spray is safe for the fruit. But it also keeps away insects that help the fruit.

Guy Moore is vice president at Larriland Farm. He said that stink bugs caused a lot of damage in 2010 and 2011. But they did not cause significant damage after that.

USDA scientists take samples of apples and peaches from his farm. They have been able to help watch over the stink bug population. Moore hopes the stink bugs will only be a small problem in the future.

Stink bugs have been in North America for a short period of time. Scientists haven't had time to find out how their population changes, Weber said.

"We've only had a few years; there's a lot of other things that can happen," he said. "We had a big cold snap this year; maybe that does nothing to them. We just don't know. The safe bet is they're not going away."

## Bringing In Predators

Some animals in the area are slowly starting to recognize stink bugs as food, Weber said. Scientists are thinking about bringing in natural enemies to feed on the stink bugs.

But that could take a long time. Introducing a stink bug enemy could take three to five years. Scientists from the U.S., Canada and Mexico would have to agree to let it happen, Weber said.

Tiny wasps could be the chosen enemy, Weber said. The wasps lay their eggs on other insects' eggs. Then the newly hatched wasps eat the eggs of their prey — including stink bugs.

Chemists have also made a copy of the stink bug's pheromones, or scent, Weber said. Growers could use the fake scent. It would draw the insects away from their fruit.

But for now, growers will have to continue to use short-term measures like pesticides. Doing this can limit the damage.

"In this business, you are at the mercy of nature. Stink bugs are something that have definitely added to that and added in a very strong way," Rinehart said. "Yeah, stink bugs are a bummer, man."
