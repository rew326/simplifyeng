WASHINGTON, D.C. — Nestle is one of the biggest food companies in the world. Last week, it made an unusual announcement. It said that some of the fish it buys is caught by slave workers. The workers were from Thailand, a country in Asia.

Nestle is a huge company. Its main office is in the country of Switzerland. Nestle makes many different kinds of foods. Nestle Crunch chocolate bars is one kind. Nestle also makes Purina pet food. Purina uses fish.

There have been many stories about the terrible working conditions in Thailand. One report discovered slavery in the fish business. More than 2,000 fishermen were rescued after people read the story. Last year, Nestle asked a group to check out the problem. The group is called Verite. It also discovered that children are forced to catch fish.

## Hard Work, Hard Life

Nestle does not use slave workers. Its fish comes from Thai food companies. They are the ones that use workers who are kept like slaves. Many other U.S. and European companies buy fish from Thailand. They all might have the same problem, Verite said.

The workers are mostly from Myanmar and Cambodia. Those countries are next to Thailand. Both are very poor. People want to work in Thailand. They pay money to get the jobs. It is against the law to do this, though. The workers then become trapped. They cannot leave until they pay back the money. Yet they owe more money than they could ever make.

The slave workers said they do not get much rest. They get little food or water. Fishing companies do not let them speak with their friends or family.

A worker from Myanmar spoke to Verite. He said that he has worked on a fishing boat for 10 years. He has no money. He said life is very hard for him.

## A Plan To Help The Workers

Nestle said it was angry about the problem. It promised to come up with a plan to stop it. Nestle also said it will teach boat owners and captains how to properly treat workers fairly.

Mark Lagon runs Freedom House. It is a group trying to end worker slavery. He praised Nestle for the report. Companies will not always look into reports of bad working conditions. If it is true that workers are being mistreated, the companies usually do not tell anyone. Sometimes a company will not even say it is checking out the problem in the first place, he said.
