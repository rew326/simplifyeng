TIJUANA, Mexico — Emma Sanchez Paulsen has three sons. They like to climb into her bed. She tells them a bedtime story.

The whole family used to live in California. At night, she told them stories about her childhood in Mexico. She would tell them about running through green fields.

Nine years ago, she had to leave the United States and go back to Mexico. Emma was in America without permission, which is against the law. The government did not let her return. At the time, her sons were little. Alex was 5, Ryan was 3 and Brannon was just 2 months old. They stayed in the United States with their father. She moved to Tijuana. The Mexican town is near the border.

Her sons did not understand why their mother did not live with them.

## Lonely Nights Led To Her Most Important Story

Then the boys made up their own stories.

In their stories, they brought their mother home. They bounced her over the border on a trampoline. They tied balloons to her arms and legs. She floated over the border.

Emma spent many nights without her sons. She wrote a bedtime story for them. It was the most important story she ever wrote. It was about a young elf. He and his brothers visit their mother in the land of the fairies. They battled a dragon.

The story says that the elf's family was not like others. The elf did not live with his mom.

## Turning Stories Into Books

She called her story "The Little Elf." It is now part of a collection of bedtime stories. They are written by mothers and fathers living in Tijuana. The parents all live apart from their families. The book is called "Cuentos Para Dormir." It means "Bedtime Stories" in Spanish.

Sophia Sobko is a teacher. She helps the parents turn their stories into books.

Sophia said she could not find a book explaining deportation to a child. Deportation is when a person is sent back to his or her home country. Sophia knew there is a need for a book like that. Many children have a parent who has been deported.

## She Still Tells Her Boys A Story

Emma's sons visit her about twice a month in Tijuana. When they sleep over, they sit on her bed. She tells them a bedtime story.

Her story ends with hope. The elf and his mother would be together again. They would live in the happiest city in the world.
