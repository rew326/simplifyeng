In 1783, Russia took over the Crimean Tatars' kingdom. Over the next 50 years, it forced more than 600,000 Tatars to leave. This is according to Gulnara Abdulayeva. She is a Crimean Tatar historian and television reporter.

During World War II, Nazi Germany invaded Crimea. After the Nazis left, Soviet Russia controlled the area again and made the entire Tatar people move away. Josef Stalin, the head of the Soviet Union, accused the Tatars of being traitors. He forced them to leave their land.

The Abdulkerimovs are a Tatar family. They have lived in Crimea for generations.

## Forced To Leave

Jafer Abdulkerimov is a frail 81-year-old man. He has bright eyes and a steady voice. He also has an excellent memory.

Abdulkerimov remembers every detail of what happened in 1944. On May 18, 1944, Jafer, his two brothers and his mother were woken at 5 a.m. They were put into trucks with hundreds of other Tatar families. Eventually, they were loaded onto a river boat. The Tatar families were forced to stay below deck during the entire trip.

"Women and children were crying and wailing while old men were praying," Abdulkerimov said. "We all thought they would sink the (boat) with us in it."

Abdulkerimov's family were taken to frozen Siberia. More than 600 Tatars died during the first two years there. Adults had to chop wood. Children survived on a tiny bit of old bread each day.

About 200,000 Crimean Tatars were forced to leave in 1944. Almost half of them died within two years.

Abdulkerimov returned to the Crimea with tens of thousands of other Tatars in 1990. Crimea is part of Ukraine. Abdulkerimov built a home.

## Russians Worry Tatars

Last week Russia sent soldiers into Crimea. Their presence has stirred up memories of war, hunger and death for the Abdulkerimovs.

He now worries that Russian troops and local Russians will attack the Crimean Tatars. There are 260,000 Tatars in the Crimea. The Tatars will be forced away again, he said.

"If somebody tells me today that another deportation is possible, I would tell him that he is an idiot," said Abdulkerimov.

But if somebody told him last week that his land would be invaded again, "I would have told him he was an idiot too," he added.

Few seriously think the Tatars will be forced to leave. So far, the Russian occupation has been peaceful. But Tatars are afraid. They are mostly Muslim. The Crimea has many Russians. These Russian want Russia to control the Crimea.

Again "the Tatars become the most (powerless) people in Crimea," said Mustafa Dzhemilev. He is a lawmaker and a Crimean Tatar activist.

## "We Will Fight Back"

"Who will prevent them from doing something totally absurd like voting to (kick us out) ... once again?" Dzhemilev asked.

But many Russian say that the Tatars want to control the Crimea. They believe the Tatars want to have their own country.

"The Tatars should watch their step now," said Alexander Zhilkin. He carried a Russian flag. "Now that our people are in power here we won't allow any separatism inside our republic."

A pro-Russian Crimean lawmaker said the Tatars are not in danger.

But the men of Abdulkerimov's community don't believe the lawmaker. They guard the streets at night and fear attacks by Russians.

When the Soviets deported Emir Shevkiev's family in 1944, the men were all at war. They couldn't protect their families. "We are here and we will fight back," said Shevkiev, a local Tatar.
