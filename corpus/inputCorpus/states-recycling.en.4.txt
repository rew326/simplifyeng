WASHINGTON, D.C. — People get rid of tons of old electronic devices each year. Some are thrown out. Others are recycled. Many are things like old televisions. There are old cellphones, too. 

States have been trying to get the makers of the electronics to pay for recycling. Half of the states still do not have recycling programs. States that do might have to change the programs. One reason is that electronics are getting smaller.

Many electronic devices should not be thrown away with regular garbage. They have dangerous materials inside. The materials can poison the water. They are bad for the soil. Plus the metal, plastic and glass in the devices can be recycled.

## Many Recycling Rules And Laws

Recycling electronics is called e-cycling. California passed the first state law requiring e-cycling. The law passed in 2003. People there pay extra money when they buy electronics. The money pays for e-cycling. Another 24 states tell the companies that make the electronics to pay for e-cycling programs. In some states, how much they pay is based on how much they sell.

There are lots of different laws and rules. This makes it hard for manufacturers to follow the rules, said Walter Alcorn. He works at the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA). The group is made up of electronics companies.

There is also a problem with some state laws, said Resa Domina. She works for a group. It looks at how electronics affect the Earth. Some laws make manufacturers pay for a certain weight of e-cycling each year. That can be a problem, she said. Manufacturers can stop paying once they have met their goal. Then cities or states have to pay instead. If they do not, recycling stops. 

Dimino said that rules could be changed. Manufacturers could be told to keep paying for recycling.

## Electronics Keep Changing

Electronic devices are also becoming smaller. People keep them longer, too. That makes it harder for companies to collect enough recycled materials, said Allison Schumacher at the CEA.

Televisions have also changed. So have computer screens. They used to be made with big tubes. The tubes had glass that had lead in it. Now most TVs and screens do not have the tubes. The tubes were heavy. It is hard to meet recycling goals based on weight without the tubes, Schumacher said. 

Recycled electronics can be fixed up and sold again. If not, they are taken apart. Then the pieces are sold.
