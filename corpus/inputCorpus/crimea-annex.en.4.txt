SIMFEROPOL, Ukraine â€” On Tuesday, Russia changed the face of Europe. The Eastern powerhouse took Crimea from Ukraine.

Russian President Vladimir Putin signed agreements with Crimea's leaders. The historic agreements make Crimea a part of Russia. The signing was held in the Kremlin. The Kremlin is a historic fortress in Moscow. Shortly before the ceremony, Putin gave a heated speech.

He blamed Ukraine's new leaders for the takeover. He called them names -- "nationalists, Russophobes and anti-Semites." A Ukrainian nationalist is a patriot. A Russophobe is anti-Russian. An anti-Semite is someone who hates Jews.

In February, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych fled Ukraine. He left after angry protests against his government. Many people were killed. Late last month, Russian soldiers marched into Crimea. They took control. Two days ago, Crimean citizens voted to separate from Ukraine and join Russia. Many Crimeans are pro-Russian.

## U.S. And Europe Angry

In his speech, Putin gave a different order of events. He claimed Crimeans asked Russia to take over their land.

Putin made it seem that Russia was rescuing Crimea. He didn't admit that Russia invaded Crimea first. In fact, Russian soldiers went into Crimea weeks before the vote to join Russia.

Respected "citizens of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, all of Russia admires your (endurance), dignity and courage," he said in his speech. Sevastopol is a port in Crimea. Russia's Black Sea Fleet is based there. The port is extremely important to the Russian navy.

The United States and Europe are angry at Russia. They say Russia broke international law. They are trying to pressure Russia into leaving Crimea. They have stopped bank accounts of Russian officials. They also won't let the officials in their countries. U.S. and Europe have threatened more punishments.

Putin said the U.S. and Europe are threatening Russia. And he said Russia will react.

But he promised that Russia will not fight against Western countries.

Putin also insisted that Russia would not invade more of Ukraine. Like Crimea, Ukraine's southeast has a large Russian-speaking population. He told the Ukrainian people that Russia has "always" respected Ukraine. "Don't trust those who scare you with Russia," he said.

## "Can Only Be Russian"

Putin then suggested that Crimea was historically part of Russia. The Soviet Union controlled Crimea until 1954. Russia was part of the Soviet Union. In 1954, the Crimea was given to Ukraine. Many Russians still live in Crimea. Ukraine gained independence in 1991 after the Soviet Union ended.

This left some Russians in the newly independent country. Putin once called the breakup of the Soviet Union the biggest disaster of the 20th century.

In his speech Tuesday, Putin called Ukraine's current government unlawful. He said they were not worth talking to.

Putin blamed the U.S. and Western Europe for the takeover. He said they encouraged the protest against Yanukovych. He said they had "crossed the line in the case of Ukraine."

He said, "They knew quite well millions of Russians live in Ukraine and Crimea." Putin said the U.S. and Western Europe should have known that Russia would take Crimea. The former Ukrainian government was very pro-Russian.

Putin promised that all of Crimea's ethnic groups would be respected. Three main groups share Crimea -- Russians, Ukrainians and Tatars. He also said the region would have three languages, Russian, Ukrainian and Tatar.

"Crimea is ... under the strong and stable (rule) which today in fact can be only Russian," he said.
