CAIRO â€” A Syrian community sits on the edge of the Egyptian capital. Women tie their headscarves in a Syrian way. They buy Syrian spices and trinkets from tables on the streets. There is a constant murmur of stories about the residents fleeing Syrian cities in the past year because of war.

The sound of Egyptian men and their mothers is the only sign that one is still in Egypt. They flock every day to the neighborhood. They are too poor to take an Egyptian bride. Instead they look for Syrian refugees who they hear are cheaper, prettier, better cooks and easier to marry.

"I am looking for a Syrian bride," a 39-year-old painter tells a Syrian merchant outside the local mosque. "They are less complicated."

The Syrian has heard this a dozen times already that day. He does not even respond. Instead, he points to a sign in front of the mosque behind him. It says that the mosque "announces that it has nothing to do with the marriage of Egyptian men to Syrian sisters. That's why there shouldn't be any questions regarding this issue in any of the offices of the organization. May Allah punish those responsible for spreading these rumors."

The painter will not leave. "Maybe there are Syrian women around the corner?" he asks.

The Syrian, who gives his name only as Khalid, just shakes his head.

 Khalid said he got the question 100 times a day before the sign. Now it is only 50. It is difficult to know if he's exaggerating.

## "Not For Sale"

"They ask us where the office is to buy a Syrian woman, as if they are buying a chicken. " said Khalid, who said he is 26. "Our women are not for sale. We are here because we did not want to be killed."

Men across the region are seeking Syrian brides. In Turkey and Jordan, rich Persian Gulf men search refugee camps to buy brides living in tents. Abuse happens a lot.

People are marrying off their daughters for as little as $70, said Marwa al-Saloumy, who works on women's issues for a regional group.

But in Cairo there are no camps. Egyptians and Syrians meet on more equal terms. Egyptian men, now poorer as the economy stagnates, find hope in the Syrians.

Syrian women say the men spot them because of how they dress. The men constantly approach them.  Alaa is a woman who fled Damascus three months ago to Cairo.  She says getting bothered has been one of her biggest challenges.

"This is not the time to marry and celebrate and enjoy life," Alaa said. That is because of what is happening in Syria.

The situation is changing marriage across Egypt. Women say that men demand more of women and offer less.  Once, an Egyptian man was expected to provide a home and prove he can work before he could marry. Now many believe they can have a Syrian bride for as little as $45.

## Looking Where Syrians Are

The men come to places where Syrians gather. The men hope to escape forced marriages or no prospects at all.

For the Syrians, defending women has become a means to maintain their dignity.

Nearly 70,000 Syrian refugees live in Egypt, the United Nations says. Most are in and around Cairo.

One women's organization said that 12,000 Syrian women married Egyptian men in the last year. But Egyptian officials have a much different number.  Between January 2012 and March 2013, 170 marriages happened, it says.

Neither side wants to admit they are involved. Syrians here find such claims insulting. Egyptian women do not want to admit that their men could find Syrian women more attractive.

Some Muslim religious leaders have told Egyptian men to marry Syrian women. They say they should do it to be generous. Top members of the Muslim Brotherhood are rumored to have taken Syrian women as second wives. The Brotherhood is a secretive religious society. It helped Mohammed Morsi become president of Egypt.

Earlier this month, a women's group condemned the push to marry Syrian women.  It even set up a hotline for Syrians to call and complain.

The number doesn't work.
