WASHINGTON â€” Pictures of men are on all American paper money.

It is time for a woman's face, a top government worker said.

"We will right that wrong," Jacob J. Lew said. He is the head of Treasury Department. It prints money for the American government.

The new $10 bill will have the picture of a woman, he said.

Who will be the first woman on American money in more than a 100 years?

A black woman who helped to end slavery? A famous first lady? The woman who started the Girl Scouts?

## Anyone Can Make A Suggestion

Jacob Lew has the final decision. He and other Treasury workers are going around the country to get ideas. People can also post their ideas on a website, thenew10.treasury.gov, or use Twitter.

Public meetings will start on June 24. They will be in Texas.

There is a group called Women On 20s. It wanted a woman's picture on the $20 bill.

The group asked people to vote. Harriet Tubman came in first. She escaped from slavery more than 150 years ago. Tubman helped hundreds of slaves reach freedom. Tubman got 118,328 of a total of 352,431 votes.

## There Are Many Choices

Lew will decide on the woman later this year. To make the cut, the woman must be dead. She also must have helped democracy.

Eleanor Roosevelt came in second in the Women On 20s vote. She was the wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. She was the first lady from 1933 to 1945. She worked to help women and fought for human rights and civil rights.

Juliette Gordon Low could be another choice. She started the Girl Scouts in 1912.

Barbara Ortiz Howard began Women On 20s. She said the group is OK with a woman on $10 bills. It is not so important that a woman be on $20 bills. Having a woman's picture on money is the important thing.

## Martha Was Really First

The last woman to appear on American paper money was Martha Washington. She was the wife of President George Washington. She was on a $1 bill more than 100 years ago.

The Treasury expects to have the new $10 bill ready in 2020. That year will be the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It gave women the right to vote. Before then, women could not vote in elections.
