LOS ANGELES, Calif. — Where's Rey? New "Star Wars" toys came out with the "Star Wars" movie. Rey is a main character in the movie. Yet there are not many Rey toys. 

Monopoly is a popular board game. The "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" Monopoly game is in stores. Many "Star Wars" characters are in the game. Rey was not in the new game. 

Many people are unhappy that Rey was not part of the game. People want more Rey toys in stores.

## "Girls Matter"

Disney made the "Star Wars" movie. Disney says it will sell new Rey toys. She will hold a blue lightsaber.

Hasbro makes Monopoly. An 8-year-old girl wrote to Hasbro. She said "girls matter." Last week, both Disney and Hasbro decided to add Rey to new Monopoly games.

Disney did not want people to see Rey toys before the movie came out. Certain Rey toys might give away the story. In the movie, Rey picks up Finn's lightsaber. She fights Kylo Ren. He is an evil character. A Rey lightsaber toy might have spoiled the surprise.

## It Was A Secret

Paul Southern works at Disney. He said people did not know Rey was a heroine in the movie. Disney kept it a secret.

That secret is why Rey was not in Monopoly. The game had old "Star Wars" characters. It just had two new ones. The only new characters were Kylo Ren and Finn. Paul said that if Rey had been in the game, people would have known she was the heroine. 

Steve Sansweet runs a "Star Wars" museum in California. He says that only boys used to like "Star Wars" toys. Now, girls like them too. Rey is a girl. Disney was surprised that kids wanted Rey toys. Steve said boys want Rey toys too. 

Steve said it is interesting how things turned out. Now there is a new collector's item. There will be the new Monopoly game with Rey. There is also the old one without her. "I want to get both" games, he said.
