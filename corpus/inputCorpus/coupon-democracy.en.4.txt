SEATTLE, Wash. — When people want to make a difference, most of them vote. They can elect leaders who change things. Now one city is giving people another way. Each person is getting one hundred dollars. People can give the money to people they support.  

The program is in Seattle. It is a city in Washington state. Voters will get four vouchers - or coupons - they can use in an election. Each is worth $25. The vouchers make it easier for everyday people to get more involved in politics. 

## Giving Everyone A Voice

"We're very eager to see how it works," said Michael Malin. He runs a group that is trying to make elections more fair.

Malin said that right now, politics are controlled by too few people. The rich have more money to give. They can influence who runs in elections. Now this program helps everyone have a voice. 

## Raising Taxes To Offer Vouchers

Seattle's plan is not cheap. The money for vouchers has to come from somewhere. So Seattle's voters decided to raise taxes. Taxes come out of the money that people earn at their jobs. People also pay taxes on how much their homes are worth. Taxes are how the government pays for things. Taxes pay for things like roads, schools and playgrounds. Taxes will also pay for vouchers. 

Many people support this idea. They think Seattle's program will help more people make a difference. Supporters also hope other cities will follow Seattle's lead.

## Fair Or Foul?

Not everyone is so sure. 

Some people think the vouchers might not help all candidates in the same way. They think the program is not fair. They believe the vouchers make it harder for new candidates in an election. New candidates might not be ready to accept the money coming from vouchers. 

Alan Durning came up with the plan. He does not agree with the problems people have with it. Durning thinks that money to help candidates is a good thing. The vouchers make things more equal, he said. They can help all candidates get ahead. 

In the past, not many Seattle voters have given money to campaigns. In 2013, fewer than two of every 10 people gave money in Seattle elections. People who support the program want more voters to donate. The vouchers make that easier. They say that vouchers give everyone a chance.
