The city sent workers to the place where Super Bowl City will be. The workers are there to help the homeless. The city wants the homeless to go to shelters. The shelters will try to help. The homeless can find a place to sleep there.

## City Has Many Homeless

Jennifer Friedenback works in San Francisco. Her job is to help stop homelessness. She said that many people will be in the city for the Super Bowl. There will be TV cameras. She said that the city is moving poor people away from the fans and cameras. That way it looks like there are not many poor people.

Homelessness is a big problem in San Francisco. It has gotten worse. Housing prices are going up quickly. Many people cannot pay for a home.

Jane Kim works for the city. She is helping it get ready for the Super Bowl. Jane said the city should always help the homeless. San Francisco is only helping them for the Super Bowl.

## "Shelters Are Nasty," Man Says

Christine Falvey works with the mayor. She said the city is helping the homeless because of the cold winter. It is not just because of the Super Bowl, Christine said.

"Shelters are nasty," Christopher said.

The day the game is played has a special name. We call it Super Bowl Sunday. This year, the Carolina Panthers will play the Denver Broncos.
