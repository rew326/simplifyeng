BEIRUT, Lebanon â€” The United States bombed parts of Syria for the first time on Tuesday. The attacks seem to have badly hurt the militant fighters the U.S. military was targeting.

The main target was the Islamic State (ISIL). It is a group of fighters who have taken over parts of Syria and Iraq. The U.S. government says the group is a great danger to the Middle East.

The group calls itself the Islamic State of Syria and the Levant (ISIL) and has also been called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Levant is the English term for the region stretching from southern Turkey through Syria to Egypt.

It was not known how many people were hurt or killed, reports said.

The U.S. airstrikes are a sign that the fighting in the region is becoming worse and spreading. Before, the U.S. attacks had taken place only in Iraq. Syria and Iraq are neighbors.

The U.S. military planes struck several places in northern Syria, said the U.S. military and witnesses on the ground. The area is the part of Syria that touches Turkey to the west. The attacks were aimed at four Syrian cities. One of the them was the city of Raqqa in north-central Syria. Many ISIL fighters are in Raqqa.

## U.S. Navy Ships Also Took Part

The strikes were carried out by different aircraft including fighter jets and bombers. The U.S. military also used drones. The drones are planes that fly with no pilot and drop bombs. Tomahawk missiles were fired from U.S. Navy ships. The ships were in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea. Five countries aided in the strikes. They were Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, the United States said.

All the planes returned safely to their bases, U.S. officials said.

The strikes "destroyed or damaged" several targets, U.S. military leaders said. The targets that were hit included training centers, storage buildings and vehicles. All were being used by ISIL. Some of the fighters were hit also.

## Islamic State Has Spread Easily

Separately, the United States targeted fighters called the "Khorasan Group." The group includes old members of the al-Qaida terrorist network. Al-Qaida attacked the United States on Sept. 11, 2001. The U.S. military said Khorasan was about to attack very soon. The attack would target the United States in some way. The U.S. military did not give more details of the plot.

The president of Syria is Bashar Assad. Syrians have lived with civil war for three years as rebels have fought against Assad and his government. The civil war has made it easy for militant groups like ISIL to spread.

The attack around Raqqa began in the middle of the night, said Abu Khalil. He is an activist in the city. He uses a nickname for safety reasons. The attack included more than 18 separate hits, he said.

Most people in Raqqa were in their homes during the attacks, said Khalil. Some hid in basements. It is not known how many were hurt or killed.

After the airstrikes, the fighters fled their headquarters, said Khalil.

## They Were Expecting An Attack

"Of course the people are scared," Khalil said. He added that people there were divided about the U.S. airstrikes. If the attacks can be limited and strike only ISIL, "then I am for it," he said.

The group has been moving many of its leaders and heavy weapons out of the city of Raqqa recently, activists and others say. That is because they have been expecting the United States to attack. President Obama announced on Sept. 10 that the U.S. might attack inside Syria. Obama declared that the United States would wear down the militant group, and in the end destroy it.
