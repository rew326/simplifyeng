WASHINGTON â€” Tons of deadly chemicals were collected from Syria after a poison gas attack last summer. But figuring out what to do with them has been a problem. The United States has come up with a solution. The U.S. military is putting special machines on a cargo ship. The machines will be used to destroy the chemicals.

Officials said two machines have been put on the ship, named the Cape Ray. They are called hydrolysis machines.The machines use water or bleach to destroy the chemicals.

The machines should be able to get rid of Syria's gas supply and chemical ingredients in 45 to 90 days, the officials said. The chemicals can be used to make more poison gas. No chemicals will be dumped at sea.

Syria is in the middle of a civil war. So the biggest problem could be moving the gas and chemicals to the ship.

## A Sea Operation

The plan is to move the gas and chemicals by truck. They will be driven to a port city in Syria. The port is called Latakia. There the chemicals will be loaded into 150 containers. U.S. military planners fear that the trucks could be attacked on the way to Latakia, even if the trucks are heavily guarded.

"Obviously, it's a challenging environment," said a U.S. official. The official did not want to be named.

Poison gas rockets hit on Aug. 21. They struck an area east of Damascus, Syria's capital. The zone was controlled by rebels. The U.S. says more than 1,000 people were killed. The U.S. threatened to lead an attack in response. Instead, Syria President Bashar Assad agreed to surrender his poison gas weapons.

The places where Syria made poison gas have been destroyed. So have the weapons. The next thing to do is get rid of liquid chemicals. Those chemicals are mixed to make poison gas.

No country would let the chemicals be destroyed on their land. So the chemicals will be destroyed at sea. Norway has offered to take the sealed containers from Latakia to a port outside Syria. The containers will be transferred to the Cape Ray there, the officials said.

## Ship Will Have A Lab

The U.S. officials refused to say if the Cape Ray would stay in the Mediterranean Sea while the chemicals were being destroyed. It could sail elsewhere. They also refused to say how the ship would be protected.

No U.S. government workers will be in Syria to help move the chemicals. Also, no U.S. military forces will be involved in protecting the Syrian trucks on the way to Latakia.

A group called The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is working with the United Nations to destroy the weapons.  The most dangerous material must be removed from Syria by the end of this year, the organization said. The U.N. says the entire supply must be destroyed by mid-2014.

The Cape Ray is expected to be tested at sea this month. It should be ready to sail early next year.

The ship will have a lab. It will also have a protective system. The protection includes a large tent. The tent is supposed to prevent dangerous chemicals from escaping the hold if an accident occurs. Workers will wear protective suits.

The hydrolysis machines get rid of almost all of the chemicals. They leave a liquid behind. The leftover liquid is still considered hazardous. But it is not as poisonous, one of the U.S. officials said.
