ROCHESTER, Minn. â€” About 1,000 babies are born every year in the United States with half a heart. It is a rare but serious problem known as HLHS. The babies must have three major operations. Even after the operations, there is a chance their hearts will stop working way too soon.

A famous hospital called the Mayo Clinic is trying something new. Doctors there want to see to see if a certain type of cell can be used to strengthen the hearts.

Doctors hope that using these special cells can make the hearts strong enough so the babies can grow up and live longer. The cells are called stem cells. Doctors retrieve them from the cord that connected the babies to their mothers just after birth.

Christina DeShaw had a baby daughter named Ava Grace. Before Ava was born, her parents found out that the left side of her heart was not growing properly.

## Baby Ava Grace

"The world just started spinning," DeShaw said. "Our lives were forever changed" from the moment she and her husband found out.

DeShaw and her husband went to the Mayo for help.

Children with problems on the left side of the heart must have three difficult operations. The first comes days after they are born. Doctors rebuild the heart. They make it so that the right side does the work of both sides of the heart.

The operation is dangerous. Many babies did not survive it in the past. But more are living through it now.

The second and third operations are much safer. Doctors change how the blood runs through the body. They make it go straight to the lungs. This makes the heart have to work less.

## "Help All The Other Babies"

Ava Grace was born on May 8, 2012. "Her heart was the size of a walnut," DeShaw said. She was taken quickly to her first operation.

Ava stayed at the hospital until September. But she has had many problems since she went home. She even went back to Mayo in a helicopter once.

But she won't be able to be part of the study. The stem cells get put into the heart during the second operation. She has already had her second operation and missed the chance.

Still, Ava's parents want to help Mayo's study. And not just because of Ava. "We also wanted to help all the other babies," DeShaw said.

## Making Cells Work Better

Doctors at Mayo found that stem cells get weaker as they get older. They seem to get  "sick" along with the patient. Mayo just finished a test in Europe. It showed that they could make the cells work better.

Dr. Timothy Nelson is working on the new treatment. He is trying to cure HLHS, hypoplastic left heart syndrome. He thinks that the stem cells used in the new test and put into a growing heart will work even better than the ones used in Europe.

Nelson decided he wanted to find a cure for HLHS when he was studying to become a heart surgeon for children. It made him sad that babies had to have three dangerous surgeries and would often come back as  young children with sick hearts. Then the children usually could not find a new heart in time to save them.

## Research Could Help Sooner

Joshua and Sandra Hughes said they learned about Mayo's children's heart study from a friend. Their 5-year-old daughter, Jaclyn, also has HLHS.

Jaclyn had a body scan taken last week.  A doctor said Jaclyn's heart is working well after her third operation.

"The stuff they're working on now may not be available for Jackie," Sandra Hughes said. "But it may be available for the next generation."

The doctor interrupted her. He thinks the research may help a lot sooner.

"It may be available for her, too," he said.
