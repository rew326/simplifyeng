NASHVILLE, Tenn. â€” Leslie Fram came to Nashville to work at a country music TV channel. When she started working, she saw that women had a tough time getting on country music radio stations.

Fram did not hear female singers on country radio. Country singers need to be on the radio to get fans.

Fram met singers like Brandy Clark. Clark performed at a tiny cafe. Fram was amazed by the performance. Yet her songs were not being played on country radio stations.

Fram was surprised. She thought Clark should already be famous.

## What Songs Do People Want To Hear?

On the radio, Fram heard upbeat, simple songs. They were usually sung by men. Fram wanted more women to be on country radio. She also wanted better songs.

There have been more men than women in country music for a while. Something happened not long ago that got people thinking about it. It started with Keith Hill. He gives advice to country radio stations.

Hill told radio stations to play fewer female artists. Listeners want to hear male singers, he said. Hill said that radio stations should play what people want to hear.

His comments worried people. They felt keeping women off the radio was not fair.

## Country Music Star Speaks Out

In 1998, almost half of the most popular 100 country songs were sung by women. By 2014, only 2 out of 10 hit songs were sung by women.

Luke Bryan is a country music star. He said people in country music need to talk. They must discuss why there are not more women on the radio.

"The music industry can get real busy," he said. "You realize, 'Man, there isn't a female artist in the Top 10 or even in the Top 20 right now."

## Playing All The Music

Fram has created a group to help women in country music. She is working with two other women in Nashville, Tennessee. Lots of country singers make music there.

The group is called Change The Conversation. It educates and supports female musicians.

Change the Conversation is not telling radio stations to play all female artists. It is about the idea that "the best song wins," Fram said.
