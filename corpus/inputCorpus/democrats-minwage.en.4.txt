The race to become the next president of the United States has started. Next fall a Democrat will face off against a Republican. The winner will become president.

The race in the fall is known as the general election. Before it happens the Democrats and Republicans must first pick the person who will run next year.

The first contest is called the primary election. It is happening right now. Democrats are running against other Democrats. Republicans are running against other Republicans.

## Picking One Person For The Party

Most voters belong to one of the two groups, or parties. During a primary they can only vote for a candidate from their own party. A candidate is someone who is running for office.

The Democratic candidates had their first debate Tuesday night. Debates allow candidates to say why they are the best person for the job. That also means saying why the others are not the right person.

Tuesday's debate was shown on TV. Millions of people watched it.

The top three Democratic candidates are Bernie Sanders, Martin O'Malley and Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right now Clinton is in the lead.

## 2 Candidates Want Pay Rate To Be $15

On Tuesday the candidates talked about many things. They each have different ideas about how to make the country better.

They skipped over one important thing, though. They did not talk about the minimum wage.

The minimum wage sets what people are paid for working. Bosses must pay workers the minimum wage. Anything less is against the law.

Right now the minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. The law covers the whole country.

Sanders, O'Malley and Clinton all want to raise the minimum wage. They have different ideas about how much it should be raised, though.

Sanders and O'Malley want to raise it to $15 an hour.

## Clinton Keeping Quiet About Her Thoughts On Pay

Clinton also thinks the minimum wage should be higher. She has not said how much it should be raised, though. She probably wants it to be less than $15 an hour.

Clinton might have good reasons for not saying.

If the minimum wage is too high, there might be problems. Bosses might find it hard to pay their workers. They might stop giving new people jobs. Many people would have a harder time finding work.

Some people say $15 an hour is worth a try, though. It could make life easier for many people.
