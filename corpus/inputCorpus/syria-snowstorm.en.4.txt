BEKAA, Lebanon â€”  Snow covers the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon. People from the capital came to the mountains with sleds and toboggans. They piled souvenir snow onto their cars for the drive home to Beirut from the winter wonderland. But there was nothing merry about the weekend blizzard for the Syrians living in camps there.

Um Mahmoud shares a tent with a dozen other Syrians in the valley. She is a refugee. Like many others, she escaped the war in her homeland. Syrian rebels are fighting Syria's president and the army.

A chain of people hauled 14 pails of mud and slush from her tent after the snowstorm.

"It was like a sea here yesterday," Um Mahmoud, a mother of 10, said Sunday. She and other women were showing visitors the inside of their mud-floor tent. It was damp and dirty after the storm. "How can we cook in such a mess?" she said. She pulled back a curtain to show a bare kitchen. It only had a little food. Sometimes rats attacked the kitchen.

## "It Has Been Freezing Cold"

The next storm cannot be far off. Another muddy mess will follow it.

More than 1 million Syrian refugees live in tiny Lebanon, officials say. About 1 in 5 people who live there is a Syrian.

The Syrian war is entering its third winter. Many refugees in Lebanon cannot afford apartments or don't have family to host them. Many camps have popped up. They provide for basic needs. The camps are not permanent. Aid arrives here and there, refugees say. Many tents have heating stoves. But there is not a lot of fuel.

"It has been freezing cold here and fuel was like gold," said Ahmad Awadh. Awadh lives in a another camp in the Bekaa Valley.

Awadh's site is slightly nicer than the abandoned factory grounds where Um Mahmoud lives. The camp has 39 tents. The tents have concrete floors and blue plastic sheeting. The plastic provides some protection from the rain and snow.

## Thinking Of Loved Ones Back Home

About 500 people live in the camp. Most of the tents appear to have portable heaters and stoves. Some have electricity. Still, people complain that aid only comes occasionally. Also, signing children up for schools is next to impossible. Finding a job is only a dream.

As the sun shone, people cleared garbage out of their tents. They hung their wet clothes to dry and gathered firewood. For many this is not their first winter away from home. Their situation is difficult, they say, but not life-threatening. Their thoughts remain with loved ones back in Syria. People there face daily fighting. They also cannot get regular supplies of food, fuel and water.

Outside of Damascus, Um Ammar has been told, desperate people are burning school desks and clothing for heat. The situation is terrible. Yet Syrians here seem to want to go back as soon as possible.

Many ask foreign visitors about the chance for peace. Will there be talks at the United Nations next month, they ask. They are keen for any sign of progress in the war.

Many say they were lucky to be in Lebanon, instead of Syria.

"We cannot complain too much," said Um Mahmoud. "After all, we escaped from death."
