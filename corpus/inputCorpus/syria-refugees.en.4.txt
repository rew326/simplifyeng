MAFRAQ, Jordan â€” Syrians in the Zataari refugee camp had hope last week. They believed that U.S. President Barack Obama would attack Syria's government. The president of Syria has been trying to hold on to power. Rebels have been fighting against him and his army for two years.

Then Obama said on Saturday he was not going to send missile strikes right away. He wants to get permission from Congress, first. This made the people in Zaatari angry and afraid.

"If they're going to strike, let them strike once and for all" and get rid of the government, grumbled Um Hafiz. She fled Syria with her family. Now she is a refugee like all the others living in the camp.

Others said Sunday they were worried that Obama's decision would make Syrian President Bashar Assad more brave. He might even attack Zaatari, they said. The camp is located about five miles inside Jordan. Many men and teenage boys join the rebel fighters from there.

## Watched Obama On TV

"People are angry, but when the Americans do attack, we will be happy they do," said Raad Zoubi, 23. Zoubi has lived in the camp for the past year. It is a dusty place and sits in the hot sun. The camp is made up of tents and metal huts.

U.S. officials said last week they believed the Assad government ordered an Aug. 21 poison gas attack. It took place in a town near Damascus. Rebels control the town. At least 1,429 people who were not soldiers were killed.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday that evidence showed sarin gas was used. The deadly poison gas can be inhaled or absorbed through the skin. U.N. inspectors have not confirmed if sarin was used. They are still testing samples collected in Syria last week.

People in the camp heard Obama's decision on Arabic-language television channels.

"Everybody was watching," said Zoubi.

## Don't Understand U.S. Politics

More than 120,000 people live in the camp. Many did not understand why Obama decided to ask congress for permission. Most Americans do not want the United States to get involved in Syria. But the people in Zaatari come from a country where that would not matter. Syria has been controlled by just one family for more than 40 years.

Obama's decision delays any military strike. But some in Congress doubt that Obama can get permission at all.

Fadil Issa said many refugees think Obama called off the U.S. strikes because it would have started a fight with Iran. The country is one of Assad's main allies.

"People are unhappy by this postponement. They don't understand why he's afraid of Iran," he said of Obama.

Some people were also unhappy with life at the camp. They were willing to return to Syria. They think it is worth the danger to go back home.

## Some Going Back Home

Many men, women and children waited in the heat late one afternoon. They would get on buses that would leave them near the border. From there, they were to walk to Syrian territory controlled by rebels of the Free Syrian Army.

Seats on the buses are limited. It's first come, first served. So the crowd charged the vehicles as they pulled up. People pushed and shoved through the doors. Their possessions were stuffed in cloth bundles and old suitcases.

Jordanian police forces in three armored cars stood by and just watched. They were on guard against serious trouble, not pushing and shoving.

A truck hauling a trailer with windows cut into its sides came before the buses. It appeared to be bringing rebel fighters back into Syria. Only men and teenage boys swarmed into the trailer.

"It's unbearable to live here," said Hafiz as she watched the scene. Several of her daughters were by her side. "Even with rocket explosions, it's better over there. We're not afraid. Whatever Allah has written for us will happen."
