LEAD, S.D. â€” Scientists have been searching for something for years and years. They believe there is so much of it that it makes up a quarter of the entire universe. The problem is, they don't know what it looks like. And they don't know where to find it. They do have a name for it, though. They call it dark matter.

The idea of dark matter was suggested by scientists to explain the difference between how they expected the universe to behave, and how it actually acts.

Many modern theories about the universe are based on the idea that dark matter is real. The scientists are very eager to find even the tiniest speck of it.

The latest attempt to find dark matter started a few months ago. It is happening nearly a mile underground in an abandoned gold mine. On Wednesday, scientists there announced what they had found: Nothing.

## No WIMPS Here, Yet

But the scientists were satisfied anyway. They said they had developed a new and better way of searching for the mysterious material. So, they plan to keep looking.

The experiment is known as the Large Underground Xenon experiment, or LUX. It is the most advanced search for dark matter on Earth. A detector in space has so far failed to find any of the stuff, either.

The LUX experiment is taking place in an abandoned gold mine in South Dakota. The lab is in a bright, clean space at the end of an old tunnel. It is reached by a 10-minute ride in an elevator that once carried miners.

There's a big advantage to being underground. Some 4,800 feet of earth help screen out background radiation. Such radiation can ruin experiments.

There are many theories about what dark matter is. The LUX team hopes to find it in a form with a strange name: weakly interacting massive particles. The particles are known as WIMPS.

To find the WIMPS, the scientists put in a large tank of cooled xenon gas. They hope to spot a WIMP bouncing off the center of one of the xenon's tiniest particles.

## "We Have No Clue"

But nothing has been found yet. The team will continue looking for another year. It plans to build better equipment, and to use a bigger tank of xenon.

The biggest problem is that scientists are not sure what dark matter is. The experiment has shown that some ideas were wrong, though. And there are a lot more ideas to go through.

"It's ghost-like matter," scientist Daniel McKinsey said.

Researchers "are really searching in the dark in a way," said scientist Avi Loeb. "We have no clue. We don't know what this matter is."

Still, scientists believe about one-quarter of the universe is dark matter. This is five times as much as ordinary matter. Ordinary matter is what makes up everything we see.

## Which Way To Go?

Scientists are pretty sure dark matter exists. But they are not certain what it is made of. And they don't know how it interacts with ordinary matter. Still, theories about how the universe is expanding are based on the idea that dark matter is real. So are ideas about how galaxies move and interact.

"We know there's stuff out there that is something else," said scientist Neal Weiner. "And that makes these searches hugely important because we know we are missing most of the universe."

So, why hasn't dark matter been found yet? It could be that the scientists' machines aren't good enough.

Or, it could be that scientists aren't looking in the right way. Or for the right thing.

"Perhaps we're going in the wrong direction," Loeb said.
