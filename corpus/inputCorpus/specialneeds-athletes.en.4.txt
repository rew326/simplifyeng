WICHITA, Kan. â€” Michael Kelley is a high school student and an athlete in Kansas. He loves to play sports. He also has special needs. People with special needs think differently from other people. They learn differently, too.

Michael's mom is Jolinda Kelley. Jolinda bought her son a letter jacket. Letter jackets are made mostly for high school students who play sports. The big, colorful letters on them are like prizes.

Michael was excited to wear his letter jacket. People who saw him in it would know how hard he worked.

## Jacket Troubles

Michael's mom says he got in trouble because of his letter jacket. She says the school made him take it off. She says they would not let him wear it because he has special needs.

Michael's school says that is not true. Either way, the problem got people talking about students with special needs who also play sports.

Soon, Michael's letter jacket became a big deal. It was on the news all over the country. The leaders in charge of the schools in Michael's town held a big meeting. They wanted to take a vote to decide what to do next.

## Helping Each Other Out

The leaders had some help deciding what to do. They talked to Michael's coaches at the Tri-County Athletic League. The league has sports teams for students with special needs.

The league told the school leaders about their program. They gave the school leaders a plan. The plan taught the school leaders how to help kids with special needs.

In the plan, it said that students with special needs should get letter jackets. But they have to work hard to earn them.

First, they have to play a sport for at least two seasons. The athletes cannot miss too many practices and games. They have to get good grades. The athletes have to be nice to the players on the other team.

The school leaders voted. They all wanted to use the new plan. Now Michael can wear his letter jacket and other students with special needs can work hard to earn one, too.
