Before 1920, women in the United States were not allowed to vote.

It was not easy for women to win the right to vote. They had to organize. They marched and gave speeches. Sometimes they went to prison.

Alice Stokes Paul was a leader in the women's rights movement. She helped create a group called the National Woman's Party in 1916. She worked at the group's Washington, D.C., headquarters for decades. It's a red brick house at the corner of Second Street and Constitution Avenue.

Even in the 1970s, if you knocked on the door to the house, Stokes Paul herself might open it and welcome you in.

## National Woman's Party

Stokes Paul died in 1977, but the house is still there. It's called the Sewall-Belmont house and it is still the headquarters of the National Women's Party. Today, the house is also a museum of the women's rights movement.

Despite its history, the museum is struggling. There is not enough money to pay the employees and keep the house fixed up, Page Harrington said. She runs the house and museum.

The house is 200 years old. It needs many expensive repairs.

"When winter comes, I'm terrified of a cracked pipe in the basement," Harrington said. Still, she is determined to keep the house and museum open.

"We will fight tooth and nail," she said.

## Wanting To Vote, Getting Arrested

Harrington wants to preserve the powerful story the house tells. It is a story of women working together to fight for their rights.

In 1917, many women were arrested after protesting outside the White House. Some of them were sent to the Occoquan Workhouse, a prison. They were treated badly there.

Today, a set of steps from the Occoquan Workhouse is on display outside the Sewall-Belmont House. The steps remind visitors of the sacrifices made by the women's rights pioneers.

Inez Milholland was one of those pioneers. Even though she was very sick, she continued to fight for women's rights. She collapsed while giving a speech in Los Angeles. A month later, she died at age 30.

## History Comes To Life

Inside the museum, a wonderful painting shows Milholland wearing a white cape and riding a white horse. That is how she looked in 1913, when she led a parade through Washington, D.C.

There is an old-fashioned vibe at the Sewall-Belmont House and Museum. There are black-and-white photographs, fading banners, old newspapers. The gift shop sells tea and soap.

These unusual items have a connection to the past. The National Woman's Party ran tea rooms to raise money. They sold soap, too. They were trying to say that allowing women to vote would help "clean up" politics.

## Museum Like "A Lifeline"

The museum is not cutting edge. Still, it is a snapshot of an important time in the fight for women's rights.

"We are still here," Harrington said. "It's a lifeline to the past. It draws a connection to the women who came before us."

In 1974, Stokes Paul was asked to describe her part in the struggle for women's rights.

"I always feel ... the movement is a sort of mosaic," she said. "Each of us puts in one little stone, and then you get a great mosaic at the end."
