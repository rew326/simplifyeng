SACRAMENTO, Calif. â€” William Shakespeare is one of the most famous writers who ever lived. High school students all over America read his plays and poems.

A California teacher, though, is not impressed.

This month, Diana Dusbiber wrote on a news website. She explained she does not want to teach Shakespeare's plays. Her students come from many different countries and have different skin colors. Shakespeare does not have anything to say to them, she said.

Her problem with Shakespeare is that he was white and lived 400 years ago.

## Showing Students Something Important

Dusbiber's opinion caught fire online and on radio and television. Many people strongly disagreed with her.

"High school teachers are supposed to love Shakespeare, and I don't, so I said I didn't," said Dusbiber. She teaches at Luther Burbank High School in Sacramento, California. Dusbiber said teachers depend too much on Shakespeare's plays in class. She finds this strange.

She said she does not make her students read Shakespeare. Instead, they read books and poems by authors who are not white. Dusbiber is white herself.

Nearly all of the students at Luther Burbank High School are not white. Also, about 4 out of 5 students qualified for free or low-price lunches. Their families did not make enough money to afford full-price school lunches.

Dusbiber said she wanted to show her nonwhite students something important. She wanted them to know that successful authors have different skin colors like theirs. Instead of Shakespeare, her students read authors from different backgrounds. One of them is Isabel Allende, who was born in Peru in South America. Her students also read the works of Sharon Draper, an African-American writer, and Mexican-American Francisco Jimenez.

## Acting Out "Romeo And Juliet"

In her post, Dusbiber spoke out against teaching Shakespeare. She said his view of the world is not modern. He also wrote from the viewpoint of a white man.

By reading Shakespeare, students may think that other cultures are less important, Dusbiber said.

A few miles away, Christine Baker teaches at Sacramento New Technology High School. She puts Shakespeare into modern English. Shakespeare wrote in the English language of 400 years ago. It can be very difficult for people to understand today.

Four out of 5 students at Baker's school are not white.

Baker does not agree with Dusbiber. She thinks his plays should be taught in school. Still, Baker said Shakespeare can be boring when read as a book instead of as a play.

She asked her students to act out part of his play "Romeo and Juliet." It is about two teenagers who fall in love. Their families hate each other and will not let them get married. Then, she told her students to read the play on their own.

"They get the feeling of fighting families, of young love," Baker said.

## On The Stage, Not On A Desk

Dusbiber is not the first to suggest moving away from Shakespeare in the classroom. Mark Powell works at the Salisbury Playhouse theater in England. He wrote that Shakespeare's "words were chosen to be spoken or heard, not to be read." He said Shakespeare's plays need to be performed. They lose all life when they are just read.

Many people did not like Dusbiber's view. Most of the opposition came from traditional people who do not think the education system should change. Others, though, said students need to understand how people lived and thought in the past.

Ted Appel is the principal at Burbank. He said Dusbiber wants students to read many different kinds of books. The goal is to help students think about important questions and ideas.
