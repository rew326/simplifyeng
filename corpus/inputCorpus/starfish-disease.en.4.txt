These slow animals don't seem ready for quick surprises. But last fall, these starfish got a disease. This illness is now killing them up and down the West Coast.

The disease is called sea star wasting syndrome. It is shown by a strange twisting of the starfish's arms. The animal gets white marks on its skin. The animal dies quickly after its arms fall off and its body softens. The disease has killed huge numbers of sea stars.

Scientists are worried by the number of deaths. They haven't yet found a cause for the illness.

## A Huge Outbreak

Tens of millions of starfish live on the West Coast. Scientists don't know how many have died from this disease. Pete Raimondi is a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He said between tens of thousands and millions of sea stars could have died.

Big die-offs have happened before. But none have been as large as this one. The syndrome has been seen as far south as San Diego, which is nearly 2,500 miles from Anchorage.

In Alaska, the disease was first found last summer on Kayak Island. Raimondi was working with a group surveying the sea life on the coast.

They discovered a number of diseased sea stars on the cold island. Scientists had thought that the disease happened in warmer water. "It was the last place on earth where we would have expected to see it," Professor Raimondi explained.

Scientists took pictures of the animals and left the island. Then the starfish illness started showing up all over the West Coast.

## Suffering Starfish Killed

The scientists went to Whittier, Alaska, on Aug. 25. There they found "one sea star twisted and looking deflated." That sea star was so ill that the scientists had to kill the animal to stop its suffering.

The museum killed a total of eight suffering starfish between August and November. One sea star lost two arms in a single day. The scientists had never seen anything like it. But since November, the disease seems to have vanished again.

Greg Danner works at the Museum of Anchorage. He said that it may have helped the starfish when the museum cooled the water in the tanks. But it is hard to tell. "We're in the same mystery boat as the rest of the world," he said.

Raimondi said the disease is more common in starfishes kept in museums. This could be a sign that the animals get ill more quickly outside the ocean.

But Professor Raimondi explained that the sea stars are still getting the disease in the wild. These are not unlucky animals that have been washed up on a beach. They are starfish in their usual homes.

## "The Real Question"

The scientists say that the starfish are affected differently depending on where they live. Sea stars that live in tide pools next to the beach get white marks on their skin first. They can be ill for many weeks before they die. And sometimes they don't die at all.

But the disease acts quicker for underwater starfish. It is also much more deadly. These sea stars can lose their arms in hours rather than weeks.

Raimondi said scientists are now close to finding the cause of the disease. He thinks the illness is caused by an infection.

There does not seem to be a link between the disease and a disaster in Japan in 2011. A power plant exploded there and leaked radiation into the ocean. Some experts believed this could have caused the starfish disease.

But if a cause of the disease is found, another problem for the future remains: How do we stop it? "Is it the type of thing that will heal itself over time? That's the real question," Raimondi said.
