CHICAGO, Ill. â€” Fatima and Fadi Adris were living happily in Homs. It is the third largest city in Syria in the Middle East.

They made a good home for themselves. He worked as a painter. She went to school to learn English. In 2011, war broke out in Syria.

A bomb destroyed their house, said Fadi Adris.

The family escaped to Damascus, the capital of Syria. Within five months, Damascus became dangerous, too.

## Fear And Danger

The family was very afraid. They hid in destroyed buildings.

The Adris family escaped to Lebanon, the country next to Syria. In March, they arrived in Chicago.

More than 250,000 people have been killed during the war in Syria. Millions more escaped to other countries. They are called refugees.

Leaders in Europe are trying figure out what to do about all the refugees. The United States has given about $4 billion to help. It is the most of any country. About 1,500 Syrian refugees have come to the United States. Some people say the United States should take more.

## Arriving In America

This year, 94 Syrian refugees have been brought to Illinois. A total of 62 of them live in Chicago.

In September, President Barack Obama made an announcement. He ordered the government to allow in 10,000 Syrians next year.

The Syrian-American community in Chicago is getting ready for them. The newcomers will need much help. They are coming with very little.

One of the groups is called the Syrian Community Network. Suzanne Akhras Sahloul started it last year. Akhras Sahloul left Syria about 30 years ago. She came to Chicago when she was 10. She remembers being new in Chicago. Akhras Sahloul did not know how to play baseball or do other American things.

## Finding A New Home, Friends

The groups get $1,875 for each refugee from the government. The money goes for home rent, heating and other things.

The money is not enough for everything they need. Winters are cold in Chicago, and the refugees are coming without coats.

The groups also teach them English and find them jobs. The groups also find the refugees a friend in the neighborhood to help them.

Fatima Adris said the friend takes her to the lake and the park. Adris is the mother from Homs who escaped to Chicago. She and the friend go walking and shopping. It makes her feel like she is not alone.
