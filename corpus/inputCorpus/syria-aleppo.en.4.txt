Rebel forces are fighting against armies loyal to the country's president, Bashar Assad. Aleppo and its suburbs are controlled by the rebels.

One late night, a family stood shivering on a balcony in Anadan, a town near Aleppo. They were awakened by the nightly flight of a government helicopter.

They followed the sound of the helicopter's blades. They also listened to scratchy updates from rebels on a walkie-talkie.

The helicopter had dropped two barrel bombs on nearby towns. The bombs are very strong and can bring down buildings.

The family knew that the helicopters can carry up to four of these deadly bombs. They waited for the last two.

Lights came on in basement bunkers where others went for protection. Khansa Laila walked out onto the balcony. She was wearing layers of clothing. Still, she shivered in the cold.

"I woke up from the sound of the alarm, so I'm still cold," she said. "Also, fear makes you cold."

Red streaks from a machine gun shot upward against a starry sky. But the streaks rose and fell without striking their target.

Eventually the sound of the helicopter became softer. It was replaced by the sound of a warplane.

"We don't take the warplanes seriously anymore," Laila said. Warplanes launch rockets that hit one target, she said. "But helicopters drop barrel bombs that can destroy dozens of homes with one barrel."

The family went to sleep that night to the sound of gunfire and rockets.

## City's Scary Scenery

The noise of war has become part of life in Aleppo, Syria's largest city.

Government forces have dropped barrel bombs almost every day. Some say that more than 2,000 people have been killed in these attacks.

Those still in the city have adjusted to being the President's target.

In a shoe store, a woman tries on a pair of wedge heels. She decides that they are not comfortable enough to run away in.

Hours earlier, a barrel bomb had struck a street. It hit three vehicles and killed eight people.

The next day people walked by without a glance. The destroyed vehicles had become just another part of the city's scary scenery.

"Every day we see the names of the dead scrolling across the TV screen," one man said. "They've just become numbers."

A warplane's low rumble stopped conversation at Aleppo's vegetable market.

People forgot about the unripe almonds and lettuce. Everyone turned their faces to the sky to track the plane by its sound.

People waited for the rumble to fade. It was now over another Aleppo neighborhood.

## Poundings By Big Guns Too

A couple of burnt cars mark the entrance of the city.

The helicopters attack day and night. Those attacks are coupled with poundings by warplanes and big guns. There are also regular battles between government and rebel forces. The war has changed the once-vibrant business center into one with entire neighborhoods deserted.

People say that more than two-thirds of the city's people have left and gone north. They go to Turkey. If they are not allowed into that country, they stay along its border in rundown tents.

As one Aleppo resident said of the city, "There are fighters, activists and shop owners. No one else is left."
