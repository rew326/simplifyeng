FOXBOROUGH, Mass. â€” Are the New England Patriots football's biggest cheaters?

The Super Bowl is this Sunday. It is the most important football game of the year. This year, the Patriots are playing against the Seattle Seahawks.

To get to the Super Bowl, the Patriots beat the Indianapolis Colts on January 18th. They won the game 45 to 7. After the game, some people said that the Patriots had cheated.

## A Case Of Cheating?

Each team brings its own footballs to games. The teams then use the footballs that they brought. For example, when it was the Patriots' turn to throw and catch and try to score points, they used their own footballs.

It seems that the balls that the Patriots brought did not have the right amount of air in them. They were deflated. Deflated balls are easier to grab and throw. If the Patriots deflated their balls on purpose, it would be cheating.

People have nicknamed the question "deflategate." Everyone wants to know how those balls got to be deflated. Was it on purpose?

Patriots coach Bill Belichick says it wasn't. He says that his team did not do anything wrong. He spoke to reporters on Saturday afternoon. "We feel like we followed the rules of the game," he said. "We try to do everything right."

## Belichick Blames The Weather

At first, Belichick said that he had no idea why the balls were deflated. On Saturday, however, he had a guess. He thought it might be because of the weather.

If you take a ball from a warm place to a cool place, it loses some of the air inside it. The footballs were inflated in a warm room by NFL officials. Then they were used in the game, which was on a cold day.

He also said that the team rubs the footballs before the game. They do it to break them in, like a new set of shoes. It makes them easier to hold onto. He said when they rubbed them, it could have made the footballs warmer. Then when they were taken outside, the footballs got colder. Maybe that made the footballs lose some air.

He does not know for sure if that was the reason. "I'm not a scientist. I'm not an expert," he said. "I'm just telling you what I know."

Not everyone believes him. Some people think that the Patriots took the air out of their footballs on purpose.

## Pointing Fingers At Patriots

Some think Belichick or someone else with the Patriots deflated the balls. Others are suspicious of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. The quarterback is the player who throws the football. Having a soft football is most helpful to the quarterback. It helps the quarterback get a good grip on the ball and throw it better.

Like Belichick, Brady has said he did not cheat. He said that he didn't know how the footballs got to be deflated.

"Deflategate" has gotten a lot of attention. Some people are talking about it even more than they are talking about Sunday's Super Bowl game.

Belichick complained that trying to explain what happened has taken up a lot of time. Instead of preparing for the Super Bowl, he has had to answer questions about the deflated footballs.

The NFL is looking into the matter. Like many mysteries, this one may not be solved anytime soon.

Either way, the Patriots will play in the Super Bowl this Sunday. And the NFL will make sure that all of the footballs are properly inflated.
