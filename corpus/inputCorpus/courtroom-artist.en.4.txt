LOS ANGELES, Calif. â€” Mona Shafer Edwards is an artist. She is not just a regular artist, though. She draws pictures of court trials. The pictures are used mostly by television news shows.

Not long ago, she sat in court at a big trial in Los Angeles. She had a plastic bag full of pens and markers. Her sketch pad was on her lap.

The trial was for Marion "Suge" Knight. He used to be a big shot in the rap music business. He is also accused of murder.

Edwards has been drawing court cases in Los Angeles for more than 30 years. She sketched former football player O.J. Simpson when he was accused of murder. She has also drawn pop star Michael Jackson and many other famous people.

## No Pencils, No Erasing

There are not many sketch artists around today. Television cameras have taken over in many courtrooms. Artists have found work at trials where cameras are not allowed.

Edwards became interested in the business when she saw courtroom drawings on TV many years ago. She knew she could do a better job.

"They were awful, just awful," she told her husband.

Edwards had been working for years drawing pictures for fancy clothing companies and stores. She thought that her drawing skills could work in the courtroom.

Edwards said that at a trial, she always works the same way.

She first finds something that stands out about a person. It could be a hair style, lips or their nose. Then she looks at how a person stands and how their clothes fit. Next she draws the pictures in her mind. She plans it out and starts to draw on paper. She never uses a pencil and never erases.

## Paper Sketches Go Way Back In Time

Courtroom drawings have a long history.

An artist drew the Salem witch trials of 1692, when people were accused of being witches. Drawings also were made at the 1865 trial of people involved in the killing of President Abraham Lincoln.

Then Richard Bruno Hauptmann went on trial in 1935. He was charged with killing Charles Lindbergh's son. Lindbergh was a famous pilot. News coverage of the trial was crazy. Reporters snuck in hidden cameras and tape recorders to play the trial on the radio.

The reporting on the case caused the American Bar Association to get involved. The group represents lawyers in the United States. They asked judges to stop letting cameras into courtrooms. Judges agreed to this for many years. Some judges eventually loosened the rules while others will still not allow cameras.

## Quietly Sketching The Mood

The O.J. Simpson case was one of the first trials to be shown live on television. Edwards said people thought it would be the end for courtroom artists.

The jury decided they could not say that Simpson committed the crime. Then people complained about the way news groups covered the trial. The anger over the coverage caused judges to be stricter about allowing cameras in their courtrooms.

Ronald H. Rose is a retired judge in Los Angeles. He said cameras change the way people in a case behave in court. Sometimes they act out or get very nervous. It can make it harder people to make an honest choice about whether someone is guilty or innocent.

Edwards can easily blend in and sketch pictures that show the mood of the courtroom.

She is like the eye in the courtroom for all of us, Rose said.
