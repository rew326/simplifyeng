CAMDEN, N.J. â€” Tawanda Jones grew up in Camden. The city is one of the roughest in the country. In 1986 Jones was 13. Her friends were getting into trouble. They got into gangs and tried drugs. Jones wanted to keep herself off the streets.

She joined a drill team run by the city. She was the oldest member surrounded by kids half her age. They looked to Jones as their leader. But then, the city ran out of money for the team. Parents asked Jones to start a new one, so she did. It's called the Sophisticated Sisters Drill Team.

The team used to practice under highways. But it has grown to perform on "Dancing with the Stars." Jones and her husband, Robert, give Camden's children a safe place to be.

## Practicing Their Steps

Recently, members of the drill team gathered inside a water tower. Girls and a few boys laughed and practiced dance moves and cartwheels. A man pulled drums from a storage space.

The water tower is in a dangerous part of Camden.

 Jones stands in the center.

"Get ready!" Jones, yelled cheerfully. Her voice soared over the noise.

The crowd fell silent.

"One line!" Jones hollered.

Three dozen pairs of feet shuffled across the concrete floor. The kids organized themselves. They stood from tallest to smallest. They did it with speed that comes from practicing.

Then Jones sent them marching. She adjusted their arms. She fixed their shoulders. She made them stand up straight as they stomped across the room. They followed the thunderous beat of the drum.

Jones spotted someone chewing gum. She ordered the girl to spit it out. She swooped down to pick up a pair of eyeglasses that had flown off the face of a marcher. She yelled advice, orders and praise.

## Learning How To Succeed

Jones relies on people giving money to help pay for what the team needs. Practices take place in the empty, old water tower. The team has 320 members. There isn't enough room for all of them in the tower. So Jones splits up the practice. She holds it four nights a week for different groups.

Each practice seems to bring a new problem.

"What happened to your face?" Jones asked a girl who arrived tonight with marks on her cheeks. The teenager said she had been fighting with classmates who bullied her.

Two drill team members have been shot.

"They come in here with war marks," Jones said.

But the drill team keeps going. Jones also does all she can to keep the children in school.

Jones' daughter, LaQuicia, 23, and her oldest son, Robert Jr., 17, help out.

Jones has strict rules for the team. Children must do 200 hours of community service a year. They have to keep up with their homework and get Cs or better on their report cards.

Jones takes the older children on college tours.

Destiny Bush joined the drill team as an eighth-grader. She went on one of the tours. She visited three universities with Jones. Today, Bush is 24. She has a college diploma.

"She told me I was worthy, that I could succeed," Bush said.
