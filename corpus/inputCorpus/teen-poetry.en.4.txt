Nineteen-year-old Celestelle Webster and 18-year-old Christelle Roach pour out their feelings. They are both fierce and startling as they recite poetry.

"The bones in my body are like needles in my skin … I am a bomb, take shelter."

The two are in a small auditorium. Facing each other onstage, they speak the words that they wrote together.

Webster and Roach are members of something called WordSpeak. Based in Miami, WordSpeak is a spoken-word poetry program designed for teens.

What's happening today is just a practice run. In July, WordSpeak will send Webster, Roach and five others to a national poetry contest.

WordSpeak teaches young people the craft of poetry. At the same time, it aims to give them confidence and a sense of purpose.

## Coaching The Team To The Top

Coach Teo Castellanos is key to that goal.

Castellanos is an award-winning writer and teacher. His life didn't start out promisingly. He grew up around drugs and gangs. This kind of past helps him reach kids with the same kind of tough background. Castellanos shifts easily between street slang and careful teaching.

The poetry team will need to be at the top of its game later this month. It will be heading to the Brave New Voices contest in Philadelphia. There, the members will face off against 500 other teens. The other kids will be coming from across the United States and from other countries.

At the practice run, Castellanos offers encouragement to Roach and Webster. He urges them not to forget "your goals, your rhythms."

Next up are Wesly Oviedo, Steffon Dixon and Al Alexandre. Their poem is about gun deaths. The boys are African-American and they take the subject personally, saying with anger: "I feel like Florida is the gunshine state and I'm living in the bottom of the barrel."

Castellanos is pleased — but pushes for improvement. He suggests they start with a feeling of celebration. If they begin that way, it will make the shift to gun deaths more shocking.

"It's gonna be crazy!" he says.

## Everybody Here Loves Poetry!

The seven members of the team were selected from a group of around 1,000 WordSpeak members. Each had won smaller poetry contests. These are held to help choose the team for the national contest.

The goal of WordSpeak is not just to sharpen writing and speaking skills. The program also aims to give teens more confidence.

Maylin Enamorado started performing her poetry when she was in ninth grade. At first she was afraid of getting onstage. When she was chosen for the WordSpeak team the following year, she was shocked.

Once she arrived at that earlier contest, though, she quickly became excited. It was great to be around hundreds of other kids who love poetry.

"For the first time, I was like, poetry is normal!" Enamorado says. "I felt completely at home. And the creativity, the subjects were eye-opening."

It can be a big help for these teens to find others who think like them. Roach says she's the only artist in a family focused on sports and business. She is, she says, "the pen in the box of pencils." Growing up, she wrote poetry at her brother's basketball games.

This is Roach's second year with the WordSpeak team.

"Everyone has such vast knowledge. I feel like I have so many books open to me," says Roach. "I've changed in that I know how to say what I'm feeling."
