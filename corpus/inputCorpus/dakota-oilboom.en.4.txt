WILLISTON, N.D. — An oil boom is going on in North Dakota. And with the tough job market, people are coming from all over to work there.

Andrew Klefstad has been working in the Bakken oil fields of North Dakota for four years. Like many other people, he lives somewhere else. When he's not working, he goes back to his family in Wisconsin.

One early morning in Wisconsin, he milks the cows in his father's barn. Then he fixes up his family's home.

But at 11 p.m. he has to take a train back to North Dakota. His wife, Tiffany, kisses him goodbye after driving 90 miles to the train station.

## A Long Way From Home

He grabs a seat on the train. It's a 12-hour train ride to the Bakken oil fields. Many more people do this train ride since the oil business became big in North Dakota.

Klefstad is 6 foot 5 and 290 pounds. His arms are covered with angel tattoos. He wears a bracelet his 7-year-old son made. He sent it to North Dakota with a letter saying: "Come home, Dad."

"I was like four days away from coming home," Klefstad recalled later. "I just started bawling."

But, at the oil fields, there are lots of  jobs paying a lot of money.

Young men like Klefstad are pouring into these fields. They're coming because the science of fracturing has changed the oil business. Fracturing means using water and chemicals to break through rock to get to oil below. The process is also called fracking.  It's now possible to reach oil 2 miles deep in North Dakota by fracking.

Klefstad and people like him work the oil fields for a few weeks, then head back to their homes. And then they do it all over again.

## Making A Lot Of Money

But, for Klefstad and other workers, the chance at a good job has some drawbacks.

Like many, Klefstad came because jobs are hard to find. His father couldn't pay him back on the dairy farm. And business slowed down at the company he worked for in Minnesota.

So he set off for North Dakota. He found a job quickly. Now, at only 28 with no college degree, he's earning more than $100,000 a year. He's cleaning up oil spills and washing sludge off trucks.

Klefstad says he's out here only until his loans are paid off.

And he has done well for himself. He has more than a dozen people working for him.

## A Hard Morning's Work

On this Sunday morning, he's steering his huge "supersucker" truck through the vast oil fields of the Bakken. It covers roughly 20,000 square miles — about the size of West Virginia. It even goes into Canada.

Fracking has put North Dakota just behind Texas in getting the most oil out of the ground. With all of the new workers, it's the fastest growing state in the country.

Klefstad pulls up to a giant truck wash. Dozens of trucks drop tons of sludge into the underground pit below.

He steps into a yellow jumpsuit to be safe. A worker connects a giant hose to the supersucker truck.

Klefstad goes into the pit. He's attached to a cable that could pull him out if things go wrong.

He uses the hose to suck the oil waste into his supersucker truck. It will later go into a landfill.

The work takes hours. Klefstad finally comes out — his jumpsuit covered in sludge. But, he's grinning.

"Maybe it's the level of danger, but I do love it," he says.
