Clues about how people lived can be found in their teeth.

A new study looks at the teeth of people who lived 1,000 years ago. Scientists examined their skeletons. Their teeth held a huge amount of information. This information may help scientists know what they ate. The scientists also will learn what diseases they had.

Christina Warinner is a scientist at the University of Oklahoma. She said that the teeth were like a window into the past.

"This is a game changer," she said.

## Tooth Plaque Tested

The scientists studied the plaque on the ancient teeth. Plaque is the rough, bumpy stuff that covers your teeth. You get it if you don't brush enough. Today, dentists scrape plaque off our teeth. This is part of our regular teeth cleaning.

If plaque isn't scraped off, it grows thick. The plaque can get thicker than the tooth itself. This is what happened to the skeletons. They didn't have dentists like we do today.

The plaque trapped bacteria on the skeletons' teeth. The bacteria turned into small fossils. Bacteria also live in our mouths today.

Warinner scraped the plaque off teeth. The teeth came from four people. They lived 1,000 years ago in Germany. Warinner treated the plaque with chemicals. Then, she put the plaque through a machine. The machine separates out the DNA. DNA holds the information that tells all living things how to grow and work. Every creature's DNA is different.

## What Scientists Found

The result was thrilling she said.

It's hard for scientists to get much DNA from bones. They found much more DNA in the tooth plaque. Much of the DNA came from bacteria. This bacteria causes cavities.

Scientists discovered that bacteria has not changed much in 1,000 years. They also found bits of plant DNA in the teeth. This shows what people ate 1,000 years ago.

Everyone in history has had tooth plaque. So teeth could teach us about people who lived long ago.
