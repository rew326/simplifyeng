Two football teams played a big game last winter. The teams were the New England Patriots and the Indianapolis Colts. The Colts said they thought the footballs did not feel right.

The National Football League (NFL) tested the footballs at halftime and discovered that they were low on air.

Letting air out makes the footballs easier to throw and catch. Letting too much air out is against the NFL's rules. It's called cheating.

The Patriots won the game against the Colts. Two weeks later, the Patriots beat the Seattle Seahawks in the Super Bowl.

## Punishment Still Stands

In May, the NFL said Tom Brady probably knew about the air getting let out of the footballs. He is the Patriots star quarterback. The NFL ruled that Brady could not play the first four games this year. Brady appealed, which means he asked the NFL to let him play.

Roger Goodell is the NFL commissioner and is in charge of the football league. He said the punishment still stands.

Now Brady will likely go to court and ask a judge to let him play.

Goodell gave out new information on Tuesday. Brady knew football officials wanted his cellphone. The officials thought it might contain important information. But Brady had his cellphone destroyed soon before the meeting with the officials.

Goodell said he respects Brady as a football player. Still, Brady hurt the honesty of the game, Goodell said. Now, people think that players cheat.

## Going To A Judge

Don Yee is Brady's agent. He said Goodell's decision was not fair.

Yee said that Brady gave Goodell new information. This information showed Brady was not involved. Goodell ignored the evidence, Yee said.

The NFL Players Association (NFLPA) is a group that represents football players. Football officials and the NFLPA had a talk about Brady. They did not make much progress. The NFLPA did not think Brady should sit out any games. Football officials said Brady had to be punished.

Now, Brady and the NFLPA will ask a judge to let Brady play.

Some say they have a good chance of winning.

Many in the NFL, though, do not think Brady should play.

## A Different Quarterback

If Brady cannot play, Jimmy Garoppolo would be the quarterback for the first four games of the football season. Garoppolo does not have much experience. He began playing with the Patriots just last year.

The first football game of the season is Sept. 10. The Patriots will play the Pittsburgh Steelers.
