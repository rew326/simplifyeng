Not watching so much TV is a big deal, said Terence Burke. He works for a company that studies what kids do online. It is called KidSay. Kids still watch some TV. They watch Disney and Nickelodeon, he said. They just do not watch it for as long.

## Kids Like Funny Videos

YouTube has many funny videos. Some even teach kids. 

Things change as kids get older. They watch more on Netflix. It has shows with longer stories. Tweens want that. Tweens are 11 to 12 years old. 

YouTube and Netflix have special channels just for kids. Amazon does too. Kids like that. It also is something their parents want. The kid channels are popular with preschoolers and kindergartners. Older kids want other videos.

## Family Shows Are Nice
