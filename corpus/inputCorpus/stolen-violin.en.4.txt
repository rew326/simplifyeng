MILWAUKEE â€” A 300-year-old, rare violin was stolen after a concert last Monday.

Frank Almond is the lead violinist with the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra. He had just finished a concert Monday evening. He had been playing the violin at Wisconsin Lutheran College.

Shortly before 10:30 p.m. he was robbed by a man with a stun gun. The attack happened in a parking lot behind the college, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said Tuesday.

Flynn said the violin, called a Stradivarius violin, was worth millions of dollars.

Stradivarius violins are among the world's most famous and most expensive. They were built by Antonio Stradivari during the late 1600s and early 1700s. The one Almond played was made in 1715 in Italy.

As Almond lay on the ground, the robber ran off, Flynn said. He got into a minivan nearby and sped away. The escape car was driven by the robber's partner, according to police.

## Only Valued In The Art World

Investigators believe Almond was robbed for the violin, Flynn said. The violin is famous. It's known as the Lipinski Stradivarius, after someone who owned the violin before.

In 2008, a Chicago violin seller said the Lipinski violin was close in value to another Stradivarius. That other violin sold for more than $3.5 million in 2006.

Chief Flynn described the violin taken in the robbery as "priceless." He said its value could only be appreciated by a few people.

"It can't be easily sold for even a fraction of its value," he said. "These are wildly valuable to a tiny slice of the art world."

Police have not ruled out that the robbery was an unplanned street crime. Yet, they are working with investigators with the FBI's art crimes team. The team specializes in thefts of high-end art. The International Criminal Police Organization, Interpol, has also been notified.

This is a potentially global crime, Flynn said. Investigators are searching pawn shops, where people sell their valuables. They are also looking at computer listings from around the world.

## The Man Behind The Lipinski

Almond is recovering from the attack. He will not be performing this weekend.

Almond was borrowing the instrument from its owners. It's unknown who they are. Often, the owners of famous instruments loan them to the very best performers such as Almond.

The violin's early owners included the talented Giuseppe Tartini (1692-1770). He's known to listeners for his "Devil's Trill Sonata." The instrument has also belonged to Polish violinist Karol Lipinski (1790-1861). His name became attached to the violin.

Music writer Elaine Schmidt got to hold the instrument in 2013. She was interviewing Almond. The violin seemed to be "far lighter than one would expect." She described the Lipinski as a "gorgeous example of craftsmanship."

During that 2013 interview, Almond explained that the Lipinski is affected by temperature. The violin sounds differently some days than others. Wet weather can cause it to play differently.

## A Violin That Makes Musicians Better

"One of the really mysterious things about these instruments is that they really maximize our strengths," Almond said. He began playing the Lipinski in 2008. The way it makes sound is not what one would expect.

It's like a fast car, he said. "You have to learn to drive it."

Almond was told the violin had been stored in a bank vault. He met the violin owners at the bank, and they asked him if he wanted to play it on loan. He said yes.

Niehaus said that because the violin is made of wood, "it needs to be touched, it needs to be played."

He added, "The vibrations of the music keep it alive."

In 2013, British police recovered a stolen 300-year-old Stradivarius. That violin had been missing for more than two years.
