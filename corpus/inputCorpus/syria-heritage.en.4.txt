PHILADELPHIA — Brian Daniels went to the border between Turkey and Syria this summer. His mission: to help protect Syria's history from the violence of civil war.

Daniels taught 20 Syrian people how to protect museums during emergencies. He gave them supplies to protect important pottery and old books. Daniels is a professor at University of Pennsylvania. He is an expert on preserving culture and history.

Daniels said he was amazed at the bravery of the Syrian people.

They know their lives are in danger, Daniels said. They feel it is their duty to save the things that are most precious to Syria's history.

## Syria's Civil War

Syrian rebels have been fighting against the Syrian government for more than three years. It started in 2011. At that time, people in many Arab countries began to protest in the streets. They wanted honest government and more freedom.

In Syria, President Bashar Assad used the military to stop the protests. Many people were killed and a civil war began. The war is still going on today. The rebels want Assad out.

Important historical sites are being destroyed. There are six places in Syria that the United Nations has called especially important. They are known as World Heritage sites. Five of those have been damaged in the war, said a new report.

Richard Leventhal runs the Cultural Heritage Center at the University of Pennsylvania. He works with Brian Daniels. Their group wrote the new report.

## Like A House On Fire

Cultural heritage is the common history that a group of people share. It can tell us who we are and where we come from. If important heritage sites are destroyed, people can lose their identity, Leventhal said.

Daniels compares the situation in Syria to a home that is on fire. The heritage sites in Syria are like family photos. They are one-of-a-kind and can't be replaced.

The 20 Syrians are trying "to save the family photos for the country," he said.

The report does not say which groups destroyed the sites. Daniels said both the rebels and the Syrian government are responsible for the destruction.

The United Nations has named more than 1,000 World Heritage sites around the world. These are places that have important cultural value. Others are beautiful places in nature. There are 22 World Heritage sites in the United States. Most are national parks.

## Castles And Ancient Cities

The Heritage sites in Syria are ancient buildings or cities. They include the ancient cities of Damascus, Bosra and Aleppo, and ruins from the ancient city of Palmyra. Then there are the Ancient Villages of Northern Syria, which are also known as the Dead Cities. Two castles — the Crac des Chevaliers and Qal'at Salah El-Din — also made the list.

Damascus, the capital of Syria, has been damaged less than the others.

Aleppo, a city in northwestern Syria, has not been so lucky. The ancient city has seen heavy fighting during the war. Many buildings have been damaged, including the famous Great Mosque.

The authors of the report hope it will help the U.S. government and local groups better protect historical sites during wars.
