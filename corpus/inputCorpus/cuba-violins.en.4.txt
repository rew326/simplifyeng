All need to be repaired. They have been bent out of tune by years of use.

Cuba is famous for its music. These days, however, it has a problem: It is running low on musical instruments. Andres Martinez and his two workers are doing what they can to help.

Cuba has dozens of free music schools. Each year, they turn out thousands of skilled young musicians. Many play instruments imported from other countries. Often, such instruments can only be repaired with hard-to-find materials from overseas.

String instruments, like violins, violas and cellos, are tricky. They are some of the hardest instruments to keep in good working order.

## Repairing, Building And Training

Before Cuba's 1959 revolution, many musicians played string instruments made in Europe. After the revolution, Cuba was cut off from doing business with many other countries. Getting instruments from Western Europe became much more difficult.

For many years, Russia provided Cuba with violins and cellos. These days, students must make do with inexpensive violins from China. But Chinese violins often pop strings or have other problems.

Martinez and his helpers repair dozens of instruments a year. They also build a few from scratch. In addition, they train young people to make violins.

"We do everything here," Martinez, 41, said.

Martinez's workshop opened three years ago. Since then, more than 400 violins, violas and cellos have been repaired. In addition, they have built a dozen high-quality new violins. The workshop also lends instruments to musicians who need them for concerts.

Martinez uses high-quality tools for his repairs. He takes pride in his work. Such quality, he says, cannot be found among untrained repairmen. Some use hammers to fix violins.

"Fiddle making isn't carpentry," he said.

## Keeping The Cuban Music Alive

In the past, Cuba did have a handful of excellent violin repairmen. However, they have since left the country or died. Martinez's workshop is making up for their loss.

"This workshop fills a great need," music expert Miriam Escudero said.

Cuba had a violin factory during the 1970s. However, the wood in Cuba is not very good for making some instruments. It has nowhere near the quality of the best European woods like maple.

Right now, Martinez's workshop needs money to stay open. Some of it comes from a Belgian group called Fiddlemakers Without Frontiers. Martinez says he hopes the workshop will soon make enough money so it will not need help.

Whether or not Martinez succeeds isn't only important to him. The future of Cuban music may depend just a little on his workshop.

"It's like with people," said Juan Carlos Prado, one of Martinez's workers. "If you feel bad, you need a doctor. The same thing happens with a musical instrument. If it isn't working well, you can hear it in the music."
