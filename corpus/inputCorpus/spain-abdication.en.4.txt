He said the younger generation deserves to take over. He called it "one with new energy" and willing to make the changes that Spain needs.

The king said his son Felipe is trustworthy and well-prepared. Felipe "has the sense of responsibility necessary to become head of state and launch a new stage of hope."

Juan Carlos wants to be remembered as an "honest king who did his duty."

All signs show that he will do just that. But there have also been clouds for the king. Juan Carlos has reigned since 1975. More than other European kings, he has had to fight for his popularity.

## Winning The Hearts Of Spaniards

Juan Carlos was born in Rome, Italy, on Jan. 5, 1938. He was the son of Don Juan of Bourbon and Battenberg. The Bourbon family was overthrown in 1931. Francisco Franco became the sole ruler of Spain after a civil war.

Franco decided that the country should have a king after his death. He picked Juan Carlos. Juan Carlos was 10 at the time and returned to a homeland he did not know.

Juan Carlos went to school at military colleges and the University of Madrid. But he was not a popular choice. People thought he would do whatever Franco told him to do. They called him Franco's puppet. Juan Carlos was once attacked with tomatoes when touring Spain. When he was crowned, most people didn't especially care.

Still, Juan Carlos won the hearts of Spaniards. He fought for democracy. He supported the democratic heads of Spanish government. In 1981, he helped defeat an attempted takeover of Spain's government by members of the army.

Of all the modern European kings or queens, he had the greatest effect on his country.

## Good Sense Of Humor

"You have to earn your crown every day," Juan Carlos told his son Felipe.

Juan Carlos lived a low-key lifestyle in the Zarzuela Palace. The palace is not much bigger than a large home.

Juan Carlos was friendly and easy-going. He rule was not very formal. He loved sports and fast cars, and had a good sense of humor.

His relaxed style was balanced by his more formal wife. His wife, Queen Sofia, was born in Greece. They have three children — Prince Felipe and Princesses Elena and Cristina.

The press was grateful for the democratic freedoms. They felt the king was partly responsible. So, at first they protected the royal family. They did not publicize their mistakes.

But recently the press stopped protecting the king. In 2012, news about an expensive hunting expedition to Africa appeared in Spain's newspapers. The elephant hunting trip took place in the middle of an economic crisis. Nearly one-quarter of  Spanish workers lost their jobs. Juan Carlos apologized.

## Not In Good Health

But earlier this year, his daughter, Cristina, was charged with cheating on her taxes.

There were also questions about how much money the royal family got from the government. So, earlier this year, they were given salaries.

Nor was his position as king always appreciated. Groups in several parts of Spain want to separate and form their own countries. For them, he is a symbol of a country to which they do not want to belong.

Juan Carlos is not in good health. But even as it became worse, the king insisted he would not be forced off the throne.

Through it all, the king remained popular. He was called a role model for other European royals. He knew something that every royal family should remember — that kings are not born, but made by the people.
