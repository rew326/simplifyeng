SEOUL, South Korea â€” Many people here in Seoul, South Korea are wearing facemasks this week. They want to protect themselves from a terrible disease: Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).

The disease first showed up here in May. A man who caught MERS in the Middle East brought it with him when he returned to Seoul. Soon, the disease began spreading quickly.

## Many Questions About MERS

South Korea is the first place outside the Middle East to have a MERS outbreak.

In South Korea, 108 people have caught MERS so far. People have many questions about the disease. How easy is it to catch? Has the disease changed? Will the number of cases in Seoul go up?

South Korean scientists Kee-Jong Hong and Sung-Han Kim told reporters what is known about the disease. There is no cure yet, they said. Some people who catch it die.

Still, the two scientists did have some good news.

It is not clear how MERS spreads, the scientists said. However, many diseases change over time, or mutate. Once they mutate, diseases sometimes become much easier to catch. The good news is that MERS has not mutated yet, said Hong. Still, the disease could mutate at any time, he added.

## Some With MERS Don't Get Sick

So far, MERS has mostly spread inside hospitals. People in South Korea have not caught it on the street or from their family.

The disease takes some time to spread within a person's body. Around 1 out of 4 people who catch MERS never become sick. As for the rest, they only begin to show signs of illness after the disease has spread through much of their bodies. By that point, they are usually very sick. They are likely to end up going to a hospital.

Experts do not think the disease spreads through the air. However, it has been passed from one hospital patient to another. This has happened even when the patients were more than 6 feet apart.

## Are Hospital Tools Spreading Virus?

Doctors think they have an explanation: They believe the disease is spread by the tools used to treat patients. Sometimes such tools are used on both MERS patients and those with other illnesses.

Kim said that up to 4 out of 10 people with MERS have died. However, most already had another illness. Their illness may have made their bodies unable to fight off the disease. Fewer than 1 in 10 hospital workers with MERS have died. Usually hospital workers who catch MERS do not have another illness.

If the disease has only spread in hospitals, why is Korea closing schools? If it is not spread through the air, why should people wear a facemask?

Kim said both things are wise. They are a good idea because scientists do not know exactly how the disease spreads.

## Wear A Facemask? Good Idea!

Keeping yourself from catching MERS is not the only reason to wear a facemask, Kim said. People who feel sick should wear a facemask too. Even if it just feels like a cold it is the safe thing to do.

Closing schools is a good idea too, Kim said. The disease has only spread in hospitals until now, but that could change. So far, 2,474 South Korean schools have been closed.

Hong thinks things will start to get better over the next week or two. The number of new cases of MERS in South Korea will probably start to go down, he said.
