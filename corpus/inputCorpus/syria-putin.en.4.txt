Vladimir Putin wrote a message to the American people on Thursday. He said some tough things about President Barack Obama's speech on Syria. He also basically called the United States a bully. The article appeared in the New York Times.

The Russian president mentioned God. He mentioned the pope and the rule of law. He wrote about when the United States and Russia were on the same side. They beat Nazi Germany in World War II.

He said he studied what Obama said Tuesday night. He disagrees with the president.

But Putin also said trust between him and Obama is growing. He welcomed Obama's willingness to work with Russia. The two countries are working on a plan to deal peacefully with Syria's supply of poison gas. Syria would give up the gas. It would eventually be destroyed.

## U.S. And Russia Not Talking Enough

Avoiding force in Syria will strengthen the trust between Russia and the United States, he wrote. "It will be our shared success and open the door to cooperation on other" important problems.

The article was published in the newspaper's opinion section. The section is separate from where the news is published.

Foreign leaders do not usually write in an American newspaper to try to change what the U.S. public thinks. But it happens. Putin said that the anger over Syrian chemical weapons "prompted me to speak directly to the American people and their political leaders."

People in the two countries are not talking to each other enough, he said.

Putin warned the United States against attacking Syria on its own. Obama has threatened to do so because of the Syrian government's supposed use of chemical weapons in its civil war. Few countries support an attack. The United Nations would seem less important if the United States acted on its own, Putin said. An attack would also be against international law, he wrote.

## Says America Relies On Brute Force

"The law is still the law, and we must follow it whether we like it or not," he said. Human rights campaigners in Russia will take a close look at those words. They say Putin's government bends the law to serve its own purposes.

Putin said it "has become commonplace for the United States" to get involved in other countries and their fights. He did not see this as a good thing, saying "millions around the world increasingly see America not as a model of democracy but as relying solely on brute force."

The Russian president ended by talking about Obama's speech. The American president laid out the reasons for attacking Syria. Obama also said he wanted to explore Russia's idea for a peaceful end to the crisis, too. He explained that the United States had a history. It was a leader when there were serious global problems, Obama said.

"That's what makes America different," the U.S. president said. "That's what makes us exceptional."

Putin said he did not agree with the "case he made on American exceptionalism. ... It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation." He concluded that "... we must not forget that God created us equal."
