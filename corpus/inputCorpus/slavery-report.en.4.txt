JOHANNESBURG â€” Slavery is not just something you read about in history books. It is still around today. It even exists in the United States, a new report said Thursday. But Africa has more slaves than anywhere else.

Nearly 30 million people on Earth are slaves, the report said. It is called the Global Slavery Index. Africa has 38 of the 50 countries where slavery is at its worst, it said.

Mauritania is a country in West Africa. It has the poorest record. Some 150,000 people are held captive there, the report said. Many of their parents were slaves. They were born into slavery. Other countries with a lot of slavery also are located in West Africa.

West Africa has a sad place in the history of slavery. Africans captured by raiders were taken there. Then they were shipped to the New World. Today, children are bought and sold around the region. They are forced to work in homes and farms. Some are sold for other duties.

## Many Slaves Are Children

In many African countries, children are sold into labor by poor parents. Some are sent to Islamic schools. There, they are forced to beg on the streets by religious leaders. Others are made child soldiers by armed gangs. Girls are often married off young. They cannot go to school. Some of them are also forced to work for armed groups.

The risks of becoming a slave are high in many African countries, the report said. It mentioned extreme poverty, armed conflicts and government corruption as some of the reasons.

Women can still be forced to marry. Children are also made to marry, the reported said. "Traditional" laws allow this to happen.

As many as 20 percent of the people in Mauritania are enslaved, according to a group there.

Slavery in Mauritania goes back generations. The country has banned the practice. It has also signed international agreements against slavery and child labor. But the practice still has deep roots.

## "Worst Forms Of Child Labor"

Adults and children from social classes of slaves in Mauritania usually cannot read. They do not know their rights. They are regarded as the property of their masters. Slaves can see their children sold to other masters. Children are also given away as gifts.

Slaves do not have education or know of a different way to survive. So "many believe that it is God's wish for them to be slaves," the report said.

The report called on Mauritania to look into the problem. It also called on the country to do more to support slaves leaving their masters and to help them go to court to be paid back for their time as slaves.

In Ivory Coast, many children work without pay in fishing, farming, building, homes and the cocoa industry. Cocoa is one of country's major exports. Up to 800,000 children work on small family farms. Their working conditions are  similar to "the worst forms of child labor," according to the report.

The United States is ranked 134th in the Global Slavery Index. Experts think there are nearly 60,000 slaves in the U.S.

The Global Slavery Index was created by the Walk Free Foundation.

A rich Australian businessman named Andrew Forrest started the foundation. Its goal is to stop slavery. It tries to put pressure on companies. It wants them to make sure that their products and supplies are not made by slaves.
