For three centuries, millions of Africans were forced into slavery. They were taken from their families and sent to work in the Americas.

On Wednesday, the United Nations honored the memories of these African men, women and children. The world organization dedicated a memorial to slavery. The memorial is located in front of its headquarters in New York.

The memorial is called The Ark of Return. It remembers the 15 million Africans who died under slavery. It also honors the millions forced into slavery.

## Memorial "Ensures That We Never Forget"

Ban Ki-moon is the secretary-general of the United Nations, meaning he is its leader. He said the memorial encourages the world to remember the slaves. "Above all, it ensures that we never forget," he said during a ceremony.

The memorial was designed by Haitian-American architect Rodney Leon. He competed against 310 architects and designers to design it.

The memorial is made out of marble and shaped in the form of a triangle. Maps of the slave trade are carved into it. The theme is "acknowledge the tragedy, consider the tragedy, lest we forget."

## Design Sparked By Slave Ships

Leon said he was inspired by the ships that carried the slaves to the Americas. Slaves were crammed into the bottom of ships in terrible conditions. Millions of them died. As he created the memorial, Leon said he imagined how they felt as they left their homes forever.

The slaves and their descendants have given a tremendous amount to the world, he said.

Ban Ki-moon called the memorial "powerful." He said that it helps people understand that slavery destroyed millions of lives.

The United Nations has declared the years 2015 to 2024 as the International Decade for People of African Descent. It honors people whose families came from Africa. Ban called slavery "a stain on human history." He said the monument will help people think about the causes of racism. It will help people treat each other more fairly and with respect.

## "Freedom Came After A Long Journey"

The African slave trade ended more than 150 years ago. Yet, slavery still exists today. Ban said he also hoped the memorial will lead people to fight against modern-day slavery.

The memorial project began more than five years ago. It was led by African and Caribbean countries. Many slaves were forced to work on sugar plantations in the Caribbean islands. Several countries and the United Nations gave more than $1.7 million to build the memorial.

Portia Simpson Miller is the leader of Jamaica's government. She pointed out that Britain outlawed the slave trade on March 25, 1807. Yet, slavery continued. In the United States, slavery did not end until 1865.

"For us, freedom came after a long journey," she said at the ceremony. "Freedom was not gifted to us."

Simpson Miller said it was earned by "the sweat, blood and tears of millions of our forebears," who were slaves. The Americas were built by slaves.

## A Crime Against Humanity

Jean Crusol is a professor in Martinique, an island which once had many slaves. He said the memorial also honors the many people who struggled to end slavery. He spoke about a woman named Solitude who fought against slavery in the Caribbean. In Haiti, Toussaint L'Ouverture led a slave uprising. In 1804, Haiti became the first nation to end slavery.

In 2001, France declared slavery a crime against humanity. Crusol said it was time for all the countries of the world to recognize slavery as a crime against humanity and the world. "This is our challenge," he said.
