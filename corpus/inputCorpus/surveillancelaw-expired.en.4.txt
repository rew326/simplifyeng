WASHINGTON â€” Your phone calls cannot be secretly listened to anymore. The National Security Agency (NSA) has lost the right to spy on you.

The NSA hunts for terrorists in the United States. It relies on something called surveillance to find them. Surveillance involves secretly looking and listening.

The NSA has been collecting millions of phone calls. Such phone calls are made by ordinary Americans every day. The NSA hopes to spot terrorists talking to each other.

Many people think that NSA surveillance goes too far. Americans should not have to worry about being spied on, they say.

A man named Edward Snowden revealed the secret about the NSA surveillance. Snowden once worked for the NSA.

After Snowden spoke out, people began demanding that surveillance laws be changed. A new set of surveillance laws called the USA Freedom Act was introduced. The new act is supported by President Obama.

The USA Freedom Act introduces some big changes. Under it, the NSA will no longer be able to collect phone records. However, the NSA will still be able to search the records held by phone companies.

## Things Got Tricky In The Senate

The USA Freedom Act passed in the House on May 13. Then, it went on to the Senate, the other branch of Congress. The Senate needs to pass the act too before it can become law.

Things got tricky once the new act reached the Senate. A group of senators led by Mitch McConnell do not like some things about the USA Freedom Act. They say it makes it too hard for the NSA to keep Americans safe. They want the NSA to be able to search phone records more quickly and easily. The senators would not agree to vote for the bill unless some changes were made to it.

The bill needed to be voted on by Monday in order to go into law. At the last minute, McConnell and the others agreed to vote for it after all, even without changes. President Obama had strongly urged them not to miss the deadline.

But in the end, the bill did not go through. A vote was delayed and the deadline was missed. Now there is no law allowing the NSA's surveillance. It had to stop collecting calls.

## One Senator Stopped The Vote

What happened was that one senator prevented a Senate vote from taking place. That man is Rand Paul.

Paul is now running for president. He is strongly against surveillance. Paul says it takes freedoms from Americans. We should not give up our freedoms so easily, he argues.

"This is what we fought the Revolution over," Paul said. "I'm not going to take it anymore."

No new vote on the bill is likely before Tuesday at the earliest.

Paul's decision angered many other senators.

Senator John McCain complained bitterly to reporters. Paul cares more about running for president than he does about the safety of the nation, McCain said.

The government warned that not passing new surveillance laws would be dangerous. However, it said having no laws for a few days or weeks is not a big problem. Surveillance of known terrorists will still be permitted.

The problem will become serious if no new laws are ever introduced, the government said. That could happen if the Senate cannot reach an agreement.
