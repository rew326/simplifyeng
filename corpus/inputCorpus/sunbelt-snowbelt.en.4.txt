LOS ANGELES â€” California and New York still attract hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world. But the U.S. Census Bureau says that Americans find Texas, Florida, Colorado and the Carolinas far more appealing.

The Census Bureau counts the number of people who live in the United States. It also tracks where they live and move to. Its latest report found that states in the Southern and Western U.S. helped the country's population grow the most. More babies were born in those states than in the North and East. But, the other reason was more foreigners and newcomers from other states moved to Southern and Western states.

The study tracked these moves. When people move to a new country or state it's often to find work or better homes. Jobs became hard to find when the recession began in 2007. It was a period when many people lost their jobs and homes. Though the recession ended in 2009 its effects are still being felt.

The census helped scientists see the recession's effect on movements from state to state.

## Fewer Americans Moving South

During the recession, that movement, or migration, from state to state decreased. Fewer jobs were to be had. People feared moving far from home.

People saw little reason to move then. But even though the recession is over, migration has not gone back to what it was.

The Census Bureau tracked state-to-state movement between July 2012 and July 2013. Results showed only small signs of increased migration.

"People were sort of frozen in place by the recession," said Kenneth M. Johnson. He teaches at the University of New Hampshire.

Johnson says that more Americans are moving than they did a few years ago. But not nearly as many as before the recession.

Before the recession, Americans often moved from the snowbelt states for ones in the sunbelt.

The snowbelt is a region in the northern part of the United States. Chilly states like Minnesota and New Hampshire are in the snowbelt.

The sunbelt stretches across the southern and southwestern U.S. It runs from Florida to California.

But fewer Americans now make that move south. Young Americans have been particularly cautious about moving.

"We're not back to normal," said William Frey. He's an expert on population change at the Brookings Institution.

## To, And From, California

States such as Florida, Arizona and Nevada used to bring in people from all over. Now those states aren't attracting as many people as before the recession.

Frey ran his own study. He found that the number of people moving to states like Florida, Nevada and Arizona from other states fell between 2012 and 2013.

Before the recession, Nevada used to draw more than 50,000 people a year from different states. But during the recession, Nevada lost people to other states.

After the recession, Nevada still only attracts a small number of Americans from other states.

In places like New York and California, immigration has been a big help. Foreigners have immigrated from other countries to the U.S. Their movement has made up for the loss of people to other states.

For example, the northeastern part of the country lost more than 208,000 people who once lived there. Those people moved to other parts of the country.

But the Northeast gained more than 227,000 people in the last year. Those newcomers traveled from different countries.

Hans Johnson is an immigration expert in California. He says that California used to be a state that people moved to from other states and around the world.

"Now it's a place that receives people from the rest of the world," Johnson said. "And sends people out to other parts of the U.S."
