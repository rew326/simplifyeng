A new program in Chicago found jobs for some teenagers. Then a study showed that if teens have jobs, the number of violent crimes they do may go down.

Scientists wanted to see if having a job changes the way somebody acts. So they picked teenagers. Then they gave each one a job for eight weeks. While they were working, the teens were arrested for violent crimes fewer times than teenagers who did not work. It was not just because they were too busy working to get in trouble. Even after the jobs ended, the teenagers did fewer violent crimes.

## Not Everything Improved

There were 1,634 teens who wanted to take part in the study. Only 730 were chosen. The scientists looked at the number of arrests by the teens in the study. Then they compared that to the number by the kids that were not chosen.

One thing did not improve. The amount of crimes that were not violent did not go down for the teens with jobs.

Sara Heller was in charge of the study. She is a college professor.

Most of the teenagers in the study were from families without a lot of money. Some of them had been in trouble with the law. One out of every five of the teens had been arrested before.

## An Adult Was There To Help

The teens learned many skills during their work. They learned how to handle difficult problems. They also learned how to control their moods and act like adults. Some of these skills may have helped keep them out of serious trouble.

The teens in the study also had an adult to help them out. The adult was a mentor. The mentor gave advice about work and life.

The Chicago program was called One Summer Plus. The teens in the program were paid $8.25 for every hour that they worked. They worked 25 hours each week.

One Summer Plus lasted a shorter time than other job programs. It also cost less money. Heller said it was too soon to know if the program was a good use of money. Researchers will need to collect information on the teenagers in the future. They will need to see if they find jobs and how long they work.

Teens in the study held many different kinds of jobs. They helped at day-camps, cleaned up Chicago, planted gardens and worked in offices. The jobs were not always exciting. The study wanted to teach teenagers that your first job is not always perfect.
