People dream about going to the stars. Scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky wrote that people will eventually live in space. He said that Earth was our "cradle." "You're not meant to stay in your cradle forever," said Tsiolkovsky.

Now we know more about space and ourselves. We might not be able to move into space after all.

A big problem is the size of space. Its size was not known when people first thought about going to the stars. One of the closest stars to Earth is billions of miles away. It is much farther away than the moon. People cannot travel so far in a spaceship. It would take too many years. Instead of a spaceship, we would have to make an ark. The ark would need to be big enough for people, plants, and animals.

## Staying Healthy In Space Wouldn't Be Easy

The size of the ark is a problem. The ark would have to be small enough to move at a high speed. Unfortunately, smallness also creates problems for the people, plants, and animals. 

Another problem is keeping our bodies healthy on the ark. Traveling to the stars means leaving Earth without knowing what might happen to our bodies. Any ark would be a test. The people would be lab animals. 

There would need to be rules to keep the test working. Having children would be required to keep enough people living in the ark. People would have to work. People might face many difficulties following the rules. 

## A Trip To The Stars Isn't Impossible, But It's Unlikely

Any planets the voyagers try to live in will be alive or dead. There might be life on the planet. The life could be harmless or it could be deadly. The planet might be dead. Then the people will have to make it livable. It would take many years. The ark would have to continue to work without failing.

A trip to the stars is not impossible. Still, there are many problems. It has a low chance of working. 

Several steps would need to happen before launching people into space on an ark. First, some people would need to live on Earth like they would on the ark. We would learn from how the people live. The first step is the most important. Second, there would need to be practice in an ark going around our sun. Third, machines would need to travel to other planets in space to see if people can live in any of them.
