Since last year millions of sea stars have died. A disease has killed the animals, also called starfish, from Alaska to Mexico. It's an epidemic — a disease that is out of control.

Scientists say they've never seen a disease this bad in the ocean.

Sea stars started dying in Washington state in 2013. The deaths spread south. They reached Oregon, California and Baja California. Starfish even died in city aquariums.

This week, a team of scientists announced a discovery. The team figured out what is killing the starfish. It is a virus.

The virus isn't new, they said. Sea stars in museums going back to 1942 have it. That means  the virus has been in the Pacific Ocean for 72 years.

## "Wasting Syndrome" Kills

In the past, the virus killed smaller numbers of starfish. No one knows what caused the virus to explode in the past year. It has killed up to 95 percent of the sea stars in some areas. In other words, only five out of every 100 starfish  in a group lived.

The disease that is killing starfish is known as "wasting syndrome." At least 20 different species of starfish have it.

A sea star with wasting syndrome moves more slowly. It develops white sores. Its arms begin to break off and crawl away. Finally, the starfish turns into a gooey mess and dies.

Wasting syndrome is caused by the virus scientists found. It's a type similar to one that affects insects, sea urchins, and other invertebrates — animals without a spine.

## Humans Not Affected

Scientists now know what is killing the starfish. But the mystery is still not solved.

"What started it all off?" asked Dr. Mike Murray of the Monterey Bay Aquarium. "Are there other problems in other species?'"

There are many more questions to answer. Still, the discovery is "a huge breakthrough," Murray said.

The scientists found that the virus spreads in seawater and sand. It does not affect humans.  There is no way to offer a cure for starfish.

"It would be nice if we could do that," Murray said. He compared the starfish disease to human epidemics. In the 1300s the Black Death killed millions of people in Europe.

## Modern Genetic Tools

The starfish die-off may or may not be caused by humans, Murray said. The die-off will continue on its own path, he said. Hopefully, the sea stars will get through this. But there is a chance all starfish could die off, he added.

Scientists at Cornell University discovered the virus using genetic tools.

"There are 10 million viruses in a drop of seawater," said Cornell scientist Ian Hewson. Discovering a virus "can be like looking for a needle in a haystack."

The Cornell scientists worked with 335 starfish collected on the West Coast. They exposed healthy starfish to infected ones. It taught them how the disease spreads.

Scientists now know what causes the disease. Now they need to find out made it spread so quickly. Too many starfish living close together is one explanation.

## More Baby Starfish

Other explanations blame humans: pollution and climate change.

Sea stars have an important job in tide pools and shallow waters near the shore. They eat mussels, clams and snails. Without starfish, the numbers of those other shellfish could get out of control.

Scientists have one cause for hope: sea stars in some areas had more babies than usual in the past year. All those baby starfish may be the species fighting back against this disease.

Still, big questions remain. How long will the disease continue to kill starfish? Will it affect other species? More study is needed, scientists say.
