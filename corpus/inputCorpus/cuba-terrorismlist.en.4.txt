WASHINGTON â€” The United States cut off contact with Cuba in 1961. This week, President Barack Obama cleared the way for building a new relationship between the two countries.

Obama said he plans to remove Cuba from the list of countries that support terrorism.

Congress has 45 days to consider the president's decision. Lawmakers would need to take a vote if they want to keep Cuba on the list. The Obama government thinks a vote is not likely.

Obama said most Americans agree with him about fixing the relationship.

## Cuba Says It Is Against Terrorism

Cuba is an island nation less than 100 miles from Florida. The United States ended its friendship after Cuban leader Fidel Castro grabbed power. Castro set up a communist form of government. Under communism, people have little freedom. They do not elect their leaders. The United States was worried about communism spreading here.

Cuba was put on the state terrorism list in 1982. At the time, Cuba wanted to spread its beliefs to other countries.

"Our hemisphere, and the world, look very different today than they did 33 years ago," said U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. He is in charge of the United States' relations with other countries.

If Cuba is taken off the terror list, only three countries remain. They are Iran, Sudan and Syria.

Josefina Vidal is a Cuban government official. She said the decision to take Cuba off the terror list is fair. Cuba never deserved to be on it in the first place, she said.

She said that Cuba is completely against terrorism.

Obama told Congress that Cuba is not currently supporting terrorism. Cuba has promised not to support terrorism in the future.

## It Could Take Years To Be Friends Again

Kerry said that the United States disagrees with a lot of what Cuba does. Still, Cuba's actions are not considered to be terrorism under American law.

U.S. officials said repairing the relationship could take years.

One of the first steps would be to exchange ambassadors. America's official representative in Cuba would be the ambassador. The two countries also need to agree on other issues. Right now, trade and travel to Cuba is limited.

Lawmakers in Congress passed the trade and travel rules. They wanted to pressure Cuba to end communism. Only Congress can lift them. The president, though, has the power to take Cuba off the terror list and build a new relationship.

A country on the terror list cannot buy weapons from the United States. It also cannot receive food and other kinds of help.

## A New Look At Change

Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois helped reach the agreement with Cuba. He said that he is not a fan of the Cuban government. But he said that opening up the island to American ideas and products is the best way to change Cuba. Ignoring Cuba did not work.

Not everyone agrees with Obama's decision. Two Cuban-American senators want to keep Cuba on the terror list. They do not want to be friends with Cuba while it is a communist country. They are Senator Robert Menendez from New Jersey, and Marco Rubio from Florida. Rubio is running for president.

In the past, some Americans fled to Cuba to escape criminal charges in the United States. The senators want Cuba to send them back. The senators say Cuba must stay on the terror list until it does.

Senator John McCain of Arizona agrees that Cuba should return the fugitives. "But it's not going to happen."
