Ryan Bennett of Kansas City does not demand much from his television entertainment.

But he wants his sports.

Chiefs on Sundays, plus the Royals and Missouri football and basketball when his schedule allows. "I don't really watch anything live, except sports," Bennett said.

Viewers like Bennett are critical in the world of sports. They help pay for the rising costs of running a team or a college conference.

Bennett's cable company pays for ESPN and other sports channels. The channels spend billions of dollars to show sports. These are called rights fees.

That cost gets passed on to customers. They pay whether they watch sports or not.

"I had no idea how much," Bennett said.

Cable customers paid an average of $5.06 a month for ESPN in 2012. It is the most expensive product on basic cable. By a lot.

## Sports Tax

Some have called it a sports tax on their cable bill.  Sen. John McCain wants a new law. It would let consumers pay only for what they want to watch. The idea would be to pick channels from a menu.

TNT got $1.21 per subscriber last year. For that, viewers got NBA playoff and NCAA men's basketball tournament games. But they also saw police shows like "Southland" and "Rizzoli &amp; Isles." Other channels cost even less. News station CNN received 57 cents and the Cartoon Network 20 cents.

The average monthly basic cable bill was about $90 in 2012.

ESPN was in 98.9 million households in 2012. It is one of the most seen cable networks. It took in more than $6 billion in yearly subscriber fees.

Professional athletes and college coaches keep getting bigger paychecks. Higher broadcast rights fees help this happen. Some of the costs make their way down to subscribers -- sports fans or not.

DirecTV makes new costumers pay extra in places with more than one area sports channel.

Time Warner viewers in Southern California probably will see their bills go up, too. The cable company is going to pay $7 billion for Los Angeles Dodgers games.

## People Watch Sports

The nine most-watched shows of 2012 involved live sports. And advertisers like live sports. It it is hard for people to skip commercials while they watch.

But A.J. Maestas said it all goes back to the cable company. "People will switch their cable carrier if they don't have what they want," Maestas said. He is president of a research company.

Another sports network is on the way. Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. is launching Fox Sports 1, a national sports network to challenge ESPN. Fox Sports 2 is in the works. Comcast and CBS also have sports networks.

All want cable dollars, and whether you want sports channels or not, you wind up paying for them.

McCain wants to change that. He wants to give cable subscribers the ability to pay as they go, pick channels from a menu.

Cable companies do not want this.  They like to sell popular channels like ESPN together with less desirable ones.

A growing trend -- cord-cutting -- could give the consumer the final word.

About 4.7 million American homes that paid for TV will dump cable by the end of the year. They get their entertainment from the Internet using services such as Netflix, iTunes and Hulu. That's up from about 3.74 million in 2012 who cut the cord.

Maestas tried cutting the cord himself last fall. But it didn't last. "I had to have my Washington Huskies," he said.
