WASHINGTON â€” What did your teachers do before they were teachers? Maybe they flew Black Hawk helicopters. Or they could have served on submarines. Or maybe they trained soldiers to use Stinger missiles to shoot down enemy jets and helicopters.

More than 15,000 people who served in the military have become teachers. They are part of a military program called Troops to Teachers that helps turn veterans into teachers.

The idea is that they already know how to lead. They also learned other things in the military that could be used in a classroom. Most teach in schools where there is a big need for teachers.

"A lot of times kids want to test me because I was in the military," said Anthony Kajencki. He is a former army air defense officer who teaches in Durham, N.C. "Look at this guy. Let's see how tough he is. Let's see if I can push him."

## "Captain K"

Kajencki is 41 and known to his students as "Captain K."At West Point and in the Army, he learned how to take whatever was thrown at him and carry on.

 He tries to pass that on to his students. Well, that and what it's like to jump out of a plane.

People in the program who agree to work in schools that serve low-income, high-needs students can get a $10,000 bonus.

Kajencki spent more than seven years in the Army. He trained soldiers to use missiles to shoot down enemy aircraft. He also was on the staff for a commanding general in Bosnia.

He left the military in 2001 to become a teacher. But he ended up working in large stores instead. In 2009 he looked into the Troops to Teachers program. Duke University also gave him the chance to earn an advanced degree in education. Kajencki agreed to teach at a poor school in return.

## "To Help People Succeed"

"I feel I have the ability to help people succeed," Kajencki said. "I did that in the Army. I did it in retail. Now I'm doing it in education. That's something that has given me a lot of joy."

John Helton is a 50-year-old retired Coast Guard commander. He teaches an all-boys class of fifth-graders in South Carolina. The students love to hear stories from his 30-year career. He tells about rescues at sea and being on submarines deep under water.

That is what gets students to listen, he said. Kids "want to hear someone who is excited about it and has something to say and really cares about them," he said

Helton enlisted in the Navy. He served for more than 10 years on submarines.

Then he spent 20 years as a Coast Guard engineer. The career took him to ports from Maine to the Midwest, as well as Puerto Rico.

"Pretty much everything I teach I have a story," Helton said.

## From Helicopter To Classroom

Helton worked very long days in his first year teaching last year.

He grew up without a father around most of the time, just like a lot of his students. He lived on welfare and didn't have somebody to guide him. This is why he got involved in Troops to Teachers after he retired from the Coast Guard in 2011.

Brandon Phillips' military career is also something he talks about occasionally in his fourth-grade class.

When he teaches math to his fourth-graders in Springfield, Ga., he might say, "I had to know how to do that when we would fly missions in Iraq. Pilots need to know how to do this."

Phillips, 40, was the Black Hawk flight leader on missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. He had to plan with his team, manage the work and keep everybody doing what was necessary to complete the mission.

In some ways, his classroom is no different.

"There's always multiple things going on," Phillips said. "Different people have different needs. My brain is just wired to be able to respond to that without getting too stressed out."
