WASHINGTON, D.C. â€” Government scientists have discovered a confusing new illness. It is like cancer, which can spread through a person's body. They found it in a man who was 41 years old. They believe the man got sick after he had a stomach problem.

The man's stomach problem was caused by a parasite. A parasite is a living thing that feeds off a person or animal. In this case, the parasite was a tapeworm.

It was the first time scientists had seen this problem. They had never seen cancer spread from a parasite to a person.

## Sick Man Lived In South America

The man who got sick was from South America. He lived in a country called Colombia.

Doctors in Colombia did not understand the man's illness. He had small growths in his body. They are called tumors. In some ways the tumors acted like cancer. In other ways they did not.

The doctors needed help. They asked a government health group in the United States called the CDC.

Doctors at the CDC studied tumors from the man's body. They were surprised to learn that the tumors contained DNA from a tapeworm. DNA is the building block of life.

Scientists think the Colombian man may have eaten tiny tapeworm eggs. They were probably inside food that was not clean. The tapeworms multiplied in his body.

## Case Raises Worries About Cancer

The case worries scientists for many reasons.

Until now, scientists did not think a tapeworm could have cancer. They also did not think tapeworms could spread cancer to people.

By the time doctors figured out what was wrong with the man, it was too late. The man died. It was hard to study his case after he died.

Tapeworms are very common. Doctors do not know if this tapeworm cancer illness is common. They say they need to study it more.
