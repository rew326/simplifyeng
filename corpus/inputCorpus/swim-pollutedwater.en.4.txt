Christopher Swain is about to swim in the Gowanus Canal in New York City. The canal has some of the most polluted water in America.

Swain has a purpose for swimming in the stinky water. He hopes to draw attention to it.

People have gathered around to watch.

"I'll jump in if you'll jump in," someone calls out to her friend across the canal. No one accepts the dare. Only Swain is crazy enough to go in the yucky water.

## This Water Is Really Gross

The canal is filled with many different kinds of pollution. Sewer pipes dump toilet waste right into the canal. Factories dump in poisonous waste.

Before jumping into the stinking water, Swain puts on special swim gear. Swimming cap. Goggles. Ear plugs. Thick gloves. A special suit to keep water out. Gel on his neck and face to block water.

"I don't ever worry about being in the water," says Swain. He is 47 years old and has gone swimming in polluted water before. He explained that his suit protects him like a bubble. Still, Swain carefully keeps his head above the water as he swims.

"It's just like swimming through a dirty diaper," he says.

## Tons Of Garbage In The Canal

The Gowanus Canal has been used as a dumping place for factories for more than 100 years.

The main thing polluting the canal is probably coal tar. Coal is mined from the earth. It was used to make gas for old street lamps. Coal tar was left over when the gas was made. People dumped the coal tar into the canal for many years.

## Not So Good Flavors

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is part of the government. It is in charge of protecting the environment. The agency plans to clean up the canal. It will dig up mud from the bottom. Then it will burn it.

The EPA warns people about the Gowanus Canal: do not touch the water or the mud!

Swain did both.

"I didn't drink the water," Swain explains. "It was in my mouth."

The water had many flavors, he said. They included mud, poop, chemicals and gasoline.

"We deserve a Gowanus Canal that sparkles like a jewel," Swain says.
