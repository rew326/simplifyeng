WASHINGTON â€” Genes are the building blocks of the human body. Traits get passed on through genes from one generation to the next. They decide what color eyes and hair someone has. They make a difference in how tall or thin someone is.

Genes also play a role in health. Having certain genes can put someone at risk of diseases, like cancer.

Scientific companies are trying to find such genes. If they can figure out which genes cause certain diseases, they can make tests. People can take the test to see if they have that type of gene. The companies can also make treatments for the diseases.

On Thursday, the Supreme Court said that nobody can have control over natural genes. The Supreme Court is the highest court in the United States. It has the final word on American laws.

## A Case About Patents

One company called Myriad Genetics had patents on two genes. The genes could show if someone was at risk of cancer.

A patent gives an inventor control over an invention. Only the person or company with the patent can make, use or sell the invention. The government has the power to give patents.

Some scientists felt Myriad's patents were making their work impossible. They wanted to study new ways to prevent cancer. But the patents meant they were not allowed to experiment with the genes. They decided to sue. Their case went all the way to the Supreme Court.

The court decided that just because Myriad found the genes does not mean it could control them. The judges said the company should not have been given the patents.

Many businesses and scientists were watching the case. Billions of dollars were at stake. Having the patents helped Myriad earn a lot of money. Myriad could charge more to screen for the genes since no other company could offer the same test.

## Ruling Affects Lots Of Genetic Research

Lawyer Sandra S. Park represented the scientists who sued.

"We are thrilled," Park said. "The question before the court was a simple one," but it affects lots of research in deep ways.

The ruling means that it will be easier for other companies to make cancer tests. Park said the ruling also could affect patents other genes.

Scientists said the ruling will be good for patients. The cost of the gene test will probably go down.

Myriad has been able to charge about $3,300 for its cancer test. The company said that most patients don't pay that amount. Their insurance covers much of the expense.

Myriad's lawyer said that the ruling will not harm the company in a major way. The company has many other patents and inventions.

Lawyer Vernon Winters said that the court's decision has limits. Scientists can still try to get patents. They can get them for discovering new ways of working with genes.

The court also said scientists can get patents for genes they make in a laboratory. Genes that are naturally in the human body cannot be patented.

## Balancing Reward And Roadblock

Attorney Barbara Rudolph said that it was "hard to predict" what the decision will mean for inventors. Patents should make people want to come up with new inventions. But patents can be a roadblock to more discovery. The court wanted to try to find balance between the two sides.

Justice Antonin Scalia's one-paragraph opinion showed how complicated the case was. He noted there were many scientific details in the court's decision.

Scalia said he didn't have enough knowledge to know if all the details were true.
