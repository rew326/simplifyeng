JENNINGS, Mo. — The schools in Jennings are making a change. The schools do more than just teach. They also help poor kids who do not have enough food or a place to stay at night.

Tiffany Anderson is in charge of all the schools in the city of Jennings. The city is in the state of Missouri. Anderson wants to help every student do well in school. She has been making many changes.

Many poor people live in Jennings. The kids do not always have food to eat. They do not always have a place to sleep or clean clothes. These problems can make it hard to do well in school.

Anderson said that schools should help poor kids. She thinks this will help the kids do better in school.

## Family's Food Box "Helps A Lot"

Anderson has worked to give food to poor families. Breanna Johnson is in sixth grade. Her mother does not have a job. Breanna and her mother get a box of food every two weeks. The box had canned food, vegetables and a turkey for the holidays. 

"It helps a lot," said Breanna's mother. 

Anderson has also helped homeless students. Kids who do not have a home in Jennings can stay at Hope House. 

Gwen McDile is 17 years old. She was not doing well in school earlier this year. She did not have a home. Gwen was missing one out of three days of school.

Gwen then moved into Hope House. Now she has her own bedroom. She has been eating much more.

"I've eaten more in the last two weeks than I've eaten in the last two years," Gwen said.

## More Students Finish High School

The school district in Jennings has helped many students like Gwen. More students are finishing high school.

The schools are getting better, too. Earlier, there were no music and dance classes. There was not enough money for them. Anderson thought art was important for students. She got rid of other wasteful things. She somehow found the money. 

The people in Jennings are proud of Anderson. They say she is the reason why the schools have gotten better.

"We just needed someone who believed in us," said Jeff Arnold, an art teacher.
