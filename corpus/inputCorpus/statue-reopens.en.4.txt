NEW YORK â€” The Statue of Liberty is one of America's most-loved monuments. But over and over, Lady Liberty has been kept apart from her adoring fans. The most recent breakup was caused by an uninvited guest. Her name was Sandy. She stormed through, leaving behind an awful mess.

Since Oct. 29, 2012, the statue stood alone in New York Harbor. She was shut down by Superstorm Sandy. It was the third closure since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. But the statue will be lonely no more. On Thursday, the Fourth of July, the monument reopened to visitors.

"I don't know about you, but I'm getting a little bit tired of reopening and closing the Statue of Liberty,"  David Luchsinger said. His job is to take care of the statue. "I think this time we'll just leave it alone," he said with a laugh.

Lady Liberty's home is Liberty Island. It takes just a short ferry ride to get there from Manhattan. The 127-year-old woman is the only one who lives there. She stands as a symbol of freedom.

## "Pictures Don't Do It Justice"

Visitors fell quiet as the boat circled the island. They got a close-up view of Liberty's strong jaw and steady-gazing eyes. Many lowered their cell phones, stopped taking pictures, and just stared.

"She's beautiful," said Rebecca Hines, of Byron, Ill. "This isn't something you can capture on an iPad."

"Pictures don't do it justice at all," said her 16-year-old son, Alex.

Workers labored night and day to get the statue reopened in time for Independence Day. A Fourth of July reopening had been their goal. The storm sent record waves over much of New York. Lady Liberty survived unharmed, but her home was trashed. The ferry docks were broken. There was no electricity or running water. The walkways and railings surrounding her base were a total loss.

The National Park Service was in charge of the repairs. It planned to spend about $56 million to fix Liberty Island and nearby Ellis Island. But the cost jumped to $77 million. Officials decided to use better materials. They hope to prevent the next big storm from causing so much damage.

The repairs to included 53,000 new paving stones and 2,000 feet of granite. "It was no small feat," said National Park Service Director Jonathan B. Jarvis.

## Sell-Out Crowd Of Visitors

The scramble paid off. Tickets to visit the statue's crown sold out months ago. Visitors must climb 354 stairs up a narrow, winding staircase. "It's worth it," said Bev Viger, a visitor from Canada. She came with her granddaughter, Makaela. They had managed to get crown tickets along with a friend, Danielle Williams. The three tourists were not held back by the hot and humid weather.

As they began their climb, VIPs and special guests gathered for a ribbon-cutting ceremony. There were all kinds of different people. They included three schoolteachers from Kendallville, Ind. Their pupils sold lollipops to raise money for the statue's repairs. Actor Dominic Chianese sang "God Bless America" to the crowd.

The statue has been closed several times since 1886. The past dozen years have been especially hard for visitors. Worries about security after the 2001 attacks kept Liberty Island shut down for three years. The island reopened in 2004, but the statue was kept closed for another two years. In 2006, visitors were once again allowed inside, but not up to the crown. It finally was reopened on July 4, 2009.

On Oct. 29, 2011 the statue was closed for one year as the inside was renovated. It reopened a year later, only to close after one day because of Superstorm Sandy.

"It's a highly important symbol, not just for New York but for the world," said Gil Thibault, visiting from Laguna Beach, Calif. His wife, Judy, and daughter, Sandee, agreed.

"It's not one of the seven or eight wonders of the world," he added, "but it should be."
