LOS ANGELES â€” A rocket plane traveling to the edge of space crashed during a test on Friday. The plane broke into several pieces in the middle of a California desert. One test pilot was killed and the other was injured.

The plane, called SpaceShipTwo, is not owned by NASA, the U.S. space agency. It is owned by a company called Virgin Galactic. The company has been working for almost 10 years to send people on short trips to space.

"Space is hard and today was a tough day," said George Whitesides. He is in charge of Virgin Galactic.

## Second Disaster In A Week

Two pilots were aboard SpaceShipTwo. One of the pilots used a parachute to escape the plane. Another person was found near the crash, police said.

Officials said the SpaceShipTwo crash area spread 2 to 3 miles in the desert.

Friday's test was Virgin's first rocket-powered test flight in nine months. A company called Scaled Composites helped Virgin Galactic organize the test. A leader at Scaled Composites said the flight was using a new type of fuel.

In January, SpaceShipTwo reached 71,000 feet. It was the highest it had ever flown.

The crash was the second disaster in the space business in a week. On Tuesday night, a rocket exploded just seconds after it launched in Virginia. It was carrying supplies to the space station. No one was hurt in the explosion.

## Something Went Wrong

Virgin Galactic's plans have been pushed back over and over. Branson said earlier this month that the plane was close to going to space. He did not say when it would happen.

Stuart Witt is in charge of Mojave Space and Air Port. Virgin conducted its testing there. He said he did not see an explosion or hear anything unusual.

"If there was a huge explosion, I didn't hear it," Witt said. Instead, he didn't hear anything for 90 seconds. That made him think something went wrong.

"It's when I wasn't hearing anything that I became concerned," he said.

A bigger plane called WhiteKnightTwo is supposed to carry SpaceShipTwo to 50,000 feet. It is a normal height for an airplane. From there, the spaceship separates from the carrier to blast off.

## 60 Miles Above Earth

Virgin has said that the rocket will power the spaceship extremely fast. It will go 250 times faster than a car. It can travel up to nearly 2,500 miles per hour (mph). The rocket plane is supposed to go to the edge of space, more than 60 miles above the Earth's surface. Six passengers and a pilot can fly on the rocket plane.

In space, passengers will feel weightless. There is no gravity there. They will see the curve of the Earth's surface. Then the spaceship will re-enter the atmosphere and glide back to a runway. The company planned to charge customers $250,000 for the trip.

Virgin Galactic said it has accepted more than $80 million from people who want tickets for the ride. Around 700 reservations have been made. Stars like Justin Bieber, Ashton Kutcher and Leonardo DiCaprio bought tickets. So did Jim Clash. He is a writer who lives in New York City. He reserved his ticket four years ago and says he still wants to take the trip.

"It's rocket science. It's dangerous, it's risky, it's complicated. Most of us who bought tickets know that," he said.
