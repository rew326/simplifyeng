WASHINGTON â€” Does your school know where you are now? In class? On the bus? Paying for lunch in the cafeteria?

Principals in thousands of schools know the answer. New technology lets schools keep track of students. Some schools have kids carry ID cards that have computer chips in them. Other schools track kids by their fingerprint. Or, they scan their eyeball or palm.

Schools use the devices to take attendance. They let parents know where their children get off the school bus. They can even speed up the lunch line.

## People Want To Learn More About It

The technology is supposed to make schools safer and run better. Not everyone thinks it is a good idea. Parents and lawmakers are worried about this technology. They want to know what information the schools have about students and how that information is protected. Several states are now stopping or limiting its use in schools.

This year, Florida became the first state to stop biometric technology in schools. Biometric devices recognize a person by a fingerprint or eyeball.

Other states have passed similar laws. New Hampshire and Missouri schools decided that students cannot be forced to carry cards that track them. The cards have computer chips inside. They use radio frequency identification (RFID). The chips can be read by a scanner or they send out a radio signal. The U.S. Postal Service uses RFID for tracking packages.

This year, at least 14 states passed laws stopping or limiting the tracking technology, says the Data Quality Campaign. It is a group that supports the new technology.

"Technology is moving so fast," said Paige Kowalski, who works for Data Quality Campaign. "I think that's why you're seeing these new laws. I think people are nervous about it. It's new."

## "You Can't Lose Your Finger"

Jay Fry used to be a school principal in Illinois. He came up with the idea of using biometrics in schools in 2002. He noticed students often lost their lunch money or their ID cards.

Fry said biometric technology is used in more than 1,000 school districts in 40 states. He said it is safer than a student ID card. If a student loses his ID card, someone else could pick it up. His company scans a student's finger print. "You can't lose your finger," he said.

However, some lawmakers do not like the idea. They question whether schools really need the technology.

## The Information Should Be Safe

Dorothy Hukill is lawmaker in Florida. She helped pass the law to stop the use of biometrics in Florida schools. She said students should not need it to buy a hot dog or check out a library book.

Hukill said she is not against technology. However, she is worried about keeping kids and their information safe.

Kowalski from Data Quality Campaign said the tracking technology should be allowed. But, lawmakers should make sure that parents know how their schools are using it and how it is protected.

If lawmakers stop RFIDs, "they may be taking something useful away," she said.
