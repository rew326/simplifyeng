Stories can be hard to remember. A company called StoryCorps helps people save their stories. It does not want any stories to get lost.

StoryCorps records people telling their stories. We can listen to them anytime.

Now StoryCorps is trying something new. It has a special job just for teens.

StoryCorps wants teens to be reporters. A reporter's job is to ask questions. Teens will ask their grandparents questions.

Older people have been around a long time. Some are very wise. Older people have lots of good stories.

## Sharing The Stories

Teens will ask their grandparents good questions. They will record the answers. This will save the stories.

StoryCorps has a free app that can help. It lets teens use their phones to make the recordings.

StoryCorps wants everyone to hear each other's stories. The company will put the recordings in a big library. The library is in Washington, D.C. Everyone will be able to listen to the stories.

## Families And Friends Have Fun

Thanksgiving is a very popular holiday. Families and friends share big meals. Some people travel a long way to be there.

Thanksgiving is a good day to catch up. People cook and eat and relax. They have time to talk.

StoryCorps wants teens to be reporters on Thanksgiving Day. It is OK if their grandparents are not there. They can ask someone else the questions.

StoryCorps has a special name for this project. It is called "The Great Thanksgiving Listen."

## Listening And Learning

StoryCorps has asked teachers for help. They need teachers to tell students about the project. Some teachers will make it part of their classes. The questions and stories will be fun homework.

Dave Isay started StoryCorps. He says being a reporter is not hard. Teens just have to be good listeners. They can learn a lot from their grandparents.

Going to the library is just one way to hear StoryCorps stories. Some people listen to them on the radio. They are on a popular radio show every Friday.

StoryCorps also make videos from the recordings. They use cartoons to act out what people say.
