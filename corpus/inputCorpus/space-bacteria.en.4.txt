Scientists have learned something new about the International Space Station. They found out there are more germs in space than they thought.

The space station flies about 200 miles above Earth. Astronauts live on the space station. They are working to learn more about space.

## Are Space Germs Bad For Astronauts?

NASA runs the U.S. space program. It may send people on long space trips one day. One long trip could be to the planet Mars. NASA wants to learn as much as possible about the germs on their spaceships. They do not want the germs to make the astronauts sick.

NASA has been keeping track of the germs that live on the space station. The scientists have been gathering dust from different parts of the station. Inside the dust are germs. Then the scientists grow the germs in labs. The idea was to see what types of germs are found.

There was a problem, though. Some germs are hard to grow in a lab, while other germs grow fine. This makes the results confusing. Scientists may not have been able to find out all the germs that were on the station.

## Scientists Study The Germs

So the scientists tried something different. They studied the DNA of the germs. DNA is part of every living thing. It contains the instructions for how each germ works. Looking at DNA helped scientists see all the types of germs.

The scientists looked at germs from two places. One type came from the air of the space station. The other came from surfaces. Surfaces are places like floors and table tops.

Most of the germs on the station comes from human skin. The scientists also found some germs that could make astronauts sick.

## A Healthy Trip To Mars

Astronauts in space are more likely to get sick than people on earth, said scientist Kasthuri Venkateswaran. He was in charge of the study. The reason is because the air in space is very different from earth.

Not all the germs make people sick, though. So scientists need to do more work. The next job is to find out exactly which of the germs are dangerous and will make people sick.

NASA may want to send astronauts to Mars someday. If they do, they want them to be healthy. So they need to learn more about space germs.
