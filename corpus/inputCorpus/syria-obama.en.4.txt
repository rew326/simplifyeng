ST. PETERSBURG, Russia â€” U.S. President Barack Obama said Wednesday that the world needs to punish Bashar Assad. The Syrian president supposedly ordered a poison gas attack on his people. Obama said if Assad is not punished, other leaders will not take future warnings seriously.

The Middle Eastern country of Syria is fighting a civil war. Assad is trying to hold on to power as rebels try to force him out. Thousands of people have been killed. Many of those killed were not part of the war.

Obama said a year ago that Assad would be crossing a "red line" if he used poison gas. He did not make up the red line, Obama said Wednesday. The whole world decides what is not acceptable, he explained.

President Obama was speaking in Sweden. He stopped there before heading to Russia for a meeting of world leaders.

Obama is trying to get other countries to agree with U.S. plans to use missiles to punish Assad's government. The United States says it is sure that Assad's forces were behind a gas attack on Aug. 21 near Syria's capital. More than 1,400 people were killed. Some of them were children.

## Assad Was Warned, Obama Says

Like "The Boy Who Cried Wolf," Obama argues that if you say something over and over and it doesn't come true, people stop listening. In this case, he says that Assad was warned he would be punished if he used poison gas. To do nothing would mean the world is going back on its word, he explained.

"What are you going to do about it?" the president asked about the innocent people who were poisoned.

But not many countries support Obama's plan to fire missiles at Syria. At least not yet. Some are worried about getting into another war in the area without knowing the facts. They say this happened in the Iraq war.

The United Nations is still testing samples from Syria. It plans to say if poison gas was used. But it will not say which sides used it.

Sweden's leader Fredrik Reinfeldt said his country wants the United Nations to be involved. It also wants to solve the civil war through talks or elections. It does not want a military solution.

"This small country will always say 'Let's put our hope into the United Nations, let us push on some more to get a better situation,' " Reinfeldt said. He was at the same news conference as President Obama.

## Russia Says U.S. Needs U.N. Approval

Obama says there is no doubt that poison gas was used by Assad's government. He also pointed out that he was against the war in Iraq.

"I'm not interested in repeating mistakes" by using bad information, Obama said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the United States against firing missiles at Syria. The United States should get U.N. approval first, he said. Putin was speaking to The Associated Press.

Russia usually stops the United Nations from punishing Syria. Putin said he could agree to a punishment this time. But the U.N. has to prove that Syria used poison gas.

Obama canceled a meeting he was supposed to have with Putin in Russia. The president is meeting with the leaders of Japan, China and France.

## An Uneasy Relationship

The White House said Obama and Putin should still have a chance to talk.

Putin has a frosty relationship Obama, but he tried not to let it show. Russia experts have said it is one of the worst ever between U.S. and Russian leaders.

"President Obama hasn't been elected by the American people in order to be pleasant to Russia," Putin said. Nor was he elected by the Russian people just to be pleasant, he added.

"We work, we argue about some issues. We are human." But the two countries have interests in common around the world to find solutions to their problems, he said.
