WASHINGTON, D.C. — The U.S. government says tanning beds are not safe. It says people under the age of 18 should not use them.

Tanning beds are machines that make people's skin darker. The machine makes people feel like they are lying in the sun. Some people think tanner skin makes them look better. 

## Doctors Are Worried

Many doctors say tanning beds are not safe. They say this because tanning beds can cause skin cancer. This is a very serious illness. Sometimes it kills people.  

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is part of the U.S. government. It helps make rules that keep people healthy. Now the FDA is asking for new rules. It wants to ban or stop young people from using them. It also wants adults who use tanning beds to sign a form. The form would talk about the dangers of tanning beds. When people sign the form, they are agreeing that they understand the dangers. 

## The Skin Cancer Problem

Dermatologists are skin doctors. They say more teenagers and people in their 20s are getting skin cancer. Women get skin cancer more often than men. They use tanning beds more than men.

One skin doctor compared indoor tanning to cigarettes. Both of these things can cause cancer.  

Twenty three states have laws about tanning beds. These laws say people under the age of 18 cannot use them. The government wants all 50 states to have this law. Some people think the government should not worry about this. They say it is not the government's job.

## What Do People Think?

This year, thousands of people will be told they have skin cancer. Some of them will die.    

Many American teenagers use tanning beds. There are many places that have them. They are in tanning salons, spas and other places.  

The FDA says it will listen to citizens. It will hear what people think about tanning beds. Then the government will think about the rules again. The FDA may change the rules after listening to the people.
