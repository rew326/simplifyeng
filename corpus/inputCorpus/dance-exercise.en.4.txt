Scientists have bad news for young dancers. They might be working hard, but fewer than 1 in 10 kids are getting enough exercise in their dance classes. For teens who dance, the numbers are even worse.

The scientists studying the dancers are from San Diego State University and the University of California in San Diego. More than 250 young dancers helped with their project.

Each girl wore a special belt while she was dancing. The girls took seven different kinds of dance classes. The belts kept track of how long the girls spent dancing. They could also tell how quickly the girls were moving.

## Dance Classes Miss Daily Exercise Goal

To stay healthy, students need 30 minutes of exercise during school. Doctors say students should get another 30 minutes of exercise after school.

The scientists said the dance classes they studied could not meet that goal. Every class lasted almost an hour, but students did not dance the whole time. None of the classes kept dancers moving long enough.

Some dance classes were better than others. High energy classes like hip-hop scored the highest. Dancers did 27 minutes of hard work in those classes.

Spanish dancing is pretty slow. Those classes only gave students six minutes of good exercise.

## Teen Dancers Move Less Than Kids

Scientists looked at two age groups for this study. They found one big surprise. Most teenage dancers get less exercise than younger dancers.

At first, that did not make sense to the scientists. Older students usually go to longer, harder classes. That gives them more chances to get exercise.

The scientists tried to find a reason why teens were dancing less than kids. They were taking the same classes, but the teens had harder dances. Maybe they had to stand around while they learned the moves.

Scientists also thought the younger students might just be moving more. Maybe they were not standing still in line.

## Soccer Is Better For Working Up A Sweat

When the study was finished, the scientists talked about what they had learned. They decided that team sports are better exercise than dance classes.

For example, dancers wind up standing around for about a third of each class. Soccer players stand still just as much. When they start moving, soccer players go faster and harder than dancers. Soccer players have to work up a sweat and give it their all.

Doctors say that type of exercise keeps kids from becoming overweight. Dancers hardly ever have to move that way.

Dance can be difficult, but it is challenging in a different way. It is fun to do and fun to watch. It just does not help kids stay as healthy as sports can.
