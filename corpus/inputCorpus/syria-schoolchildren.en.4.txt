MAJDAL ANJAR, Lebanon â€” Thirteen-year-old Anas and his family left Syria three years ago. His country was in the middle of a terrible war. It still is.

Now Anas makes his way through rain and cold to go to class. His school is in a tent in Syria's neighboring country of Lebanon. He goes there with 20 other Syrian children. The tent is home to a family that fled Syria. It also serves as a classroom for four hours each day.

There are no benches and no blackboard. There are no textbooks and no notebooks. Just sheets of paper and some pencils and crayons. Two young refugee women teach children like Anas how to read and write, count, draw and sing songs.

Nearly half of Syria's school-age children cannot get an education, the international group UNICEF recently reported. That is sad. Nearly all school-age children in Syria used to complete primary school.

## A Lack Of Schooling

Etaf Seif Abdel Samad said sad parents come to her every day. They beg her to let their children come to her school. Samad is the principal of a public grade school in Beirut.

The parents lost all that they had in Syria, she says. "All they have in Lebanon is the interest in their children's future," she said.

Some classrooms in Syria have been bombed. Others are used as shelters or turned into places for soldiers to sleep.

The suffering of the children is especially bad. They go hungry and get sick, which slows their growth; a lack of schooling stops their education; and the bloody war sears deep psychological scars.

Syrian refugees are desperate to get their children the most simple education. They plead with principals. They ask them to take their children into Lebanon's overcrowded public schools. Some parents send children to classes in tents. Others offer them to mosques to study with religious leaders.

## A Tent Classroom

Children's drawings hung on the plastic walls in Anas' tent classroom. An out-of-season Christmas tree decoration hung from the ceiling. Anas' feet were bare as he sat on a colorful carpet in the cold.

Anas was in fourth grade when his city of Homs in central Syria was attacked. That was nearly three years ago. Neither he nor his five older siblings have been to school since.

"My school was beautiful. It had walls and desks and doors. I had many friends there," Anas said.

In the tent classroom, there were toys and stuffed animals for younger children. The classroom also had some children's English books. The teachers told the children a fairy tale.

"It's not really a school, it's more of an entertainment," Hanadi said. She is one of two teachers.

They teach children between ages 5 and 15.

## "Somebody Smart"

"We are giving them the basics, letters and numbers," the 23-year-old Hanadi said. "We mostly try to bring some joy into their lives. They've seen too much bloodshed."

Naima Mohedeen brought her daughters to Samad's public school in Beirut. She left her youngest girl at home. She's too young to go to school. Mohedden's family fled to Lebanon only four months ago.

Mohedeen cannot read. She cried when she kissed her girls and said goodbye at the school's entrance.

"I want them to learn everything so they have a future," Mohedeen said. "I want them to become somebody. Somebody smart."
