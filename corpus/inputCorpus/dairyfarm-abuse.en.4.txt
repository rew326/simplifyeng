MILWAUKEE â€” A shocking video turned up this week. It showed farm workers slapping and poking sick and injured dairy cows. The workers used heavy machinery to force the cows to their feet. The video was taken secretly.  The workers are from the Wiese Brothers Farm in Wisconsin.

Farmers who saw the video say the treatment may not be unusual. They did not defend the way the workers treated the cows. But they did say that some actions in the video may have been necessary.

Quick action must be taken to get the cow on its feet. "Otherwise, the muscles in the back of her legs turn to mush and she will never get up again," Paul Rozadowski said. He is a dairy farmer.

You can sneak up behind the sick cow and scream, said Rozadowski. That may scare the animal into getting up. But it doesn't always work.

## A Video Of Abuse

Mercy for Animals is an animal-rights group. It hired an investigator to take the video in the fall. The video shows workers at Wiese Brothers Farm dragging downed cows. The workers pulled the cows by their legs and necks using chains attached to tractors. They whipped the cows, too.

The video also showed cows suffering from open wounds. Animal care experts call the treatment shockingly cruel.

Wiese Brothers Farm did not speak to reporters. The farm's owners released a statement instead. It said two workers were fired. The farm is helping with an investigation into animal cruelty.

Tim Carpenter is a Wisconsin state senator. Carpenter wants District Attorney David L. Lasee to look into the case. He wants Lasee to file criminal charges against the workers in the video.

Carpenter wrote a letter to Lasee asking him to take action. The letter calls the animal abuse shameful. "A clear message needs to be sent that it will not be tolerated in Wisconsin."

Lasee would not comment. His spokeswoman said the sheriff's department is still investigating the case.

## Dairy Leaders Respond To Shocking Video

Leaders from the Wisconsin dairy industry are speaking out. They say the practices shown in the video are shocking and cruel. They also say the treatment is not usual.

Farmers say some scenes in the video may have been mistaken for animal cruelty. They suggest Mercy for Animals might be promoting its own cause. The animal-rights group supports a vegan diet. Vegans don't eat animal products. They don't eat meat or eggs or dairy.

John Rosenow is a Buffalo County dairy farmer. He says large farms might have a disabled animal once a month. Workers on his farm use heavy equipment to move a downed cow. The animal is placed on a soft bed of sawdust. There it can get better.

Rosenow says kicking a downed cow won't get the animal on its feet. Using a stick won't help either. He has a way to make a cow move. He pokes the animal with an old ink pen.

A cow weighs 1,500 pounds. What can a farmer do if such a heavy animal won't get up? You have to convince the cow, says Rosenow.

The animal treatment in the video was unnecessary, says Temple Grandin. She is an expert on making sure animals are treated well. Her work has led to better treatment of animals.

## Asking For Help From Big Companies

A well-run dairy farm would never allow such things, Grandin said.

She agrees that it is hard to get a downed cow back on its feet. But you don't lift the animal into the air, she says. A machine should be used to bring the cow to a standing position.

Grandin says what she saw on the video was "terrible." But she also points out that not all dairy farms are behaving badly. "I have been on some very good dairy farms," she said.

Wiese Brothers Farm supplied milk to Foremost Farms and Nestle USA. Foremost Farms makes cheese and other dairy products. Nestle makes DiGiorno frozen pizzas. Both businesses stopped working with the farm after the video was released.

Nestle released a statement. The company said it was very angry and "deeply saddened by the mistreatment of animals shown in this video."

Mercy for Animals plans to meet with people who work for Nestle. The animal-rights group has a plan. It wants to ask Nestle to add anti-cruelty guidelines for its milk suppliers.

"We haven't heard anything from them yet," said Matt Rice. "But we are hopeful." He works for Mercy for Animals.
