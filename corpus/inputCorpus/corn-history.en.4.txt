Christopher Columbus returned to Europe from the New World in 1493. Back then, America was known as the New World.

Columbus had learned of many things during his travels. He wanted to bring them back to Europe.

One of the most exciting was a grain called corn.

Corn was delicious, Columbus said. It could help feed a lot of people.

Corn never did get much popular in Europe. Columbus did not bring back the information on how to grow and cook it.

## Corn In What We Eat And Drink

In the New World, things were very different. Corn grew more and more popular there. Today, it is in many of the things Americans eat and drink.

The United States uses far more corn than any other country. Corn is in the sodas Americans drink. It is in the potato chips they munch on. It is in hamburgers and french fries. It is in bread and cereal. It is in almost all chicken and turkey. Corn is even in most fish. There are more foods with some corn in them than there are foods without any.

It was not always that way. It took time for America to learn to like corn.

At first, mostly poor people ate corn. Over time, corn grew more popular. Soon, it was on dinner tables all over the country.

## Very Little Grown For Corn On The Cob

There are three main kinds of corn.

The first is sweet corn. Sweet corn is the most loved kind of corn. We often eat it on the cob. It is what most people think of when they hear the word "corn." Still, very little of the corn we grow is sweet corn.

A second type is called flint corn. Flint corn is the kind of corn used to make popcorn. Not much of the corn grown here is flint corn.

Then there is dent corn. It is the most important kind by far. Most of the corn grown in America today is dent corn.

Dent corn does not show up on the dinner table. It is fed to animals like cows, chicken and pigs.

Americans do eat a lot of dent corn without even knowing it, though. Dent corn is in most of the animals we eat. It is in their bodies because farmers feed it to them. Dent corn is also added to many drinks as a sweetener.

Today, corn makes up a huge part of what Americans eat. It is everywhere, even if we often do not notice it. Corn has come a long way since the days of Columbus.
