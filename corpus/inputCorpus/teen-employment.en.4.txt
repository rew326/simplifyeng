In 1999, slightly more than half of teens 16 to 19 worked a summer job. Less than a third of teens did this year.

"We have never had anything this low in our lives. This is a Great Depression for teens," said Andrew Sum. He studies the job market. "That's why it's such an important story."

The overall jobs picture is getting better in the United States. Just not for teens. Businesses are adding hundreds of thousands of jobs. But those jobs aren't going to teenagers.

## Worse For Black And Hispanic Teens

Summer is usually the time when the most teens work. They are off from school. For many, it's a chance to work for the first time. They get to learn the responsibilities that come with working.

The job picture looks even worse when broken down by race. Sum and his coworkers did just that. They compared June and July 2000 and the same two months of 2013. In 2000, about 6 of 10 white teens 16 to 19 held a job. That number fell to about 4 in 10 this summer.

A bit more than 3 of 10 black 16- to 19-year-olds held a job in 2000. That fell to below 2 in 10 this June and July. It wasn't much better for Hispanics. They saw the number fall from 4 of 10 in 2000 to less than 3 of 10 in 2013.

There was a big surprise in the research, too. Teens whose parents were rich were more likely to have a job than those whose parents made less money.

This is important. A large amount of research shows that teens who work do better socially and financially.

"Kids that get work experience when they are 17 or 18 end up graduating from college at a higher rate," said Michael Gritton. He runs the Workforce Investment Board. The group works to create jobs and for teen employment.

## Getting Harder To Find Work

"Almost every person you ask remembers their first job because they started to learn things from the world of work that they can't learn in the classroom."

The U.S. government keeps track of how many teens are working.

Workers aged 16 to 19 made up less of the workforce even before things got really bad in 2008. Part of the reason was that more people were going to college. This had been happening for many years. Also, universities now care less about work. They care more about things you have experienced in life and about community service.

But things got a lot worse for teens when businesses got hit bad in 2008. Older workers took more of the jobs that teens used to hold.

So people who want to get jobs in their 20s won't have any work experience, said Keith Hall. He worked for the U.S. government from 2008 to 2012. His department collected important information about the job market.

One problem is that business has not grown much since the Great Recession of 2008. That means older workers aren't moving up. So younger workers won't move up as fast as they used to, either, Hall said.
