Want a sweater that can change color depending on how you feel? How about a music player that matches the tunes to your heartbeat? Well, businesses are making more and more technology that you can wear.

Chaotic Moon Studios is a Texas company that is trying to come up with new "wearable tech." It's working on a product like Google's upcoming eyewear. Google Glass can log onto the Internet. It is also designing other wearable projects for several customers.

Chaotic Moon's William "Whurley" Hurley said wearable technology will be big business.

"It's just like when the iPhone came out and there was this mad gold rush. It's gonna be the same thing," Hurley said.

## Google Glass Gives A Push

Mutual Mobile is working on Google Glass programs for different kinds of customers. Doctors might use the glasses to get patient information. Warehouse workers could use them to scan codes on packages.

"People are starting to get into it," said Sam Gaddis, a company officer.

The devices depend on sensors that can measure all kinds of information. Gaddis says those sensors are becoming cheap. That helps more people develop the devices.

Mutual Mobile's developers created a football with a sensor that can measure the quality of the throw. They also made a boxing game. It measures how often you've hit the target.

Experts say that wearables are the next big thing in tech.

"I think we're going to see some very, very big leaps in just the next year," businessman Manish Chandra said. He was at a wearable technology gathering and fashion show in San Francisco. Hundreds of developers, engineers and designers were at the show.

## Extending Human Abilities

Google's glasses are making the wearable technology field more popular. So are rumors of Apple's iWatch. Analysts expect fast growth. Last year almost $9 billion in wearable technology was sold. That should climb to $30 billion by 2018, said analyst Shane Walker. Wearable technology includes everything from hearing aids to wristband pedometers.

Hurley says Google's public relations campaign for its glasses helped. Now investors are putting money into wearables.

The technology will also be used in video games. Take the Oculus Rift. It is a virtual reality headset for 3-D gaming. Virtual reality technology makes you feel like you are in the middle of a made-up world.

Robin Arnott created a program for the Rift. He showed it off at a recent meeting. Users strap on the headset. Then the program uses the sound of their voice to display a series of tunneling images.

Devices like Google's glasses place the Internet on top of the real world. Arnott describes them as "augmented reality."

Wearables "extend your abilities as a human, just as your phone does," he said.

## Not Everyone Will Adapt To It

Humans will need to adapt to the technology, said Georgia Institute of Technology professor Thad Starner. He advises Google on its glasses.

The glasses are lightweight frames. They have a hidden camera and a tiny display that responds to voice commands. The devices will cause a huge change, said Starner, offering "capabilities that people haven't thought of before."

But there are sure to be issues. Some people don't want to be secretly videoed or photographed. A new survey shows that some people don't like the idea of the new technology.

Forty-two percent of workers said they would not be willing to strap on wearable tech for their jobs. Older and more traditional workers were less willing than their younger counterparts. The survey by Cornerstone OnDemand polled 1,029 Americans aged 18 and over in August.

Then there's an issue of bandwidth, said Ritch Blasi. He writes about the wearable technology market. Right now, there simply isn't enough network service to support constant wireless use everywhere, he said. But that, too, will catch up.

"It almost makes you think everyone is going to turn into a cyborg," he said. Cyborg is a fictional, high tech comic book superhero.

Will they? "When you look at the world and everything people are doing?" Blasi said. "I think the answer to that is yes."
