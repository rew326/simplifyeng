DALLAS, Texas â€” A 14-year-old Muslim student took a homemade clock to school. Some teachers thought it looked like a bomb. On Wednesday, police said Ahmed Mohamed will not be charged with a crime.

Police do not think he meant to scare people, Chief Larry Boyd said.

The police chief said the case is over.

The teen explained that he likes to build things. He makes his own radios. He also repairs his own go-kart. On Sunday, he spent about 20 minutes before bed putting together the clock. He took a power supply and wired it to a clock.

## Principal And Police Ask Questions

On Monday, Ahmed wanted to show the clock to a teacher. He goes to a high school in Irving, Texas. He was warned to keep it in his backpack. It began beeping during another class. He let the teacher know. Soon afterward, he was taken out of the class. The principal and police officers questioned and searched him.

Then, he was put into handcuffs and taken to the police station.

Boyd said kids cannot bring things like that to school.

The boy's family says Ahmed was punished. He was suspended and had to stay home from school for three days.

Lesley Weaver is with the school district. She would not say if Ahmed was punished.

## President Calls Clock "Cool"

Many people heard about Ahmed's clock. President Barack Obama invited him to the White House.

Obama called Ahmed's clock "cool" on Twitter. He said that more kids should enjoy science like Ahmed. Obama said science makes America a great country.

The hashtag "#IStandWithAhmed" was tweeted more than 450,000 times.

Ahmed's father is Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed. He said his son just wants to invent good things to help people. He added that his son was treated badly because the family's last name is Mohamed. Mohamed is a Muslim name.

Weaver said school officials were worried about a bomb. They did not care about Ahmed's religion.

Texas lawmakers are trying to pass a new law. It says that judges can only use American law. They cannot use laws from other countries or religions. It would include Shariah, which is Muslim law. Some people are against this law. They think the law is not necessary. They say the law comes from anti-Muslim feelings. Earlier this spring, the City Council members of Irving thought the law was a good idea and gave their approval.
