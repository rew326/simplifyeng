UNITED NATIONS — Caribbean countries were European colonies 200 or more years ago, during the height of the African slave trade. Now they want money from European countries to make up for the problems caused by slavery.

Those payments are called reparations. They are meant to repair the damage that the Caribbean countries say continues today.

Almost every Caribbean leader who spoke at the United Nation last week brought up the issue.

The fight is many years old. Black scholars and others across the United States, Caribbean and Africa have unsuccessfully sought money from Britain, France and the Netherlands. But they were never supported by most citizens or political leaders. Now that has changed.

## Reparations To Fight Poverty

The push for reparations has been gaining steam in recent weeks. Leaders of the 15-member Caribbean Community group agreed to ask the former colonial powers to pay up. They have met with a British law firm and called for apologies. They might even go to the International Court of Justice if the Europeans will not deal with them. The court is the United Nations' main legal arm.

The leaders say what they want most is money for programs to help lift people out of poverty. The money could be used for things like building schools and making bridges and roads.

Ralph Gonsalves is prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. He is one of the leaders.

"It's a historic wrong that has to be righted," Gonsalves said. He noted that other groups have received payments for historic wrongs, especially during World War II.

"It's not a confrontation, it's a conversation" that the Caribbean nations are seeking for the 400-year-old problem, Gonsalves said. "It's not a protest. It's an engagement."

## European Leaders Resist Reparations

It is not clear if other nations will join the Caribbean's call. On Monday, the U.N. unveiled the winning design of a memorial to honor the victims of slavery. The memorial will be built at U.N. headquarters.

Gonsalves and other leaders say they welcome the memorial and the U.N.'s efforts. But more action is needed, he said.

Leaders of African countries like South Africa, Ghana and Ethiopia are "on board," Gonsalves said. "We're going to build the links. We have to build it inside of Europe, too, with ordinary Europeans."

But European governments might not listen.

French President François Hollande resists demands from Haiti to pay reparations. Haiti was a French colony. His refusal to that country matched that of Jacques Chirac.

He was the French president when Haiti was celebrating its 200th birthday almost 10 years ago. Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide demanded that France repay Haiti for the amount it was forced to pay for its freedom in 1804. Aristide had sent Paris a bill for the amount. He calculated it down to the last penny: $21,685,135,571.48. Chirac quickly said no.

Britain also still hasn't apologized for slavery, activists say.

## It Could Be A Long Fight

Blacks in America have not succeeded in their efforts, either. Attempts to have the courts force the U.S. to pay reparations for slavery have gone nowhere.

Still, Heather Russell says she is "cautiously hopeful" about the Caribbean Community's latest efforts. The Jamaican native is a professor of Caribbean and African-American literature.

"You have 15 heads of government who have signed on," said Russell. "This issue has never been squarely put on the table."

Verene Shepherd is a historian who has fought a long time for reparations. She said people are more aware about the effects of slavery today.

"Remember, slavery lasted 300 to 400 years. In the scheme of things, we have not been fighting a long time," she said.
