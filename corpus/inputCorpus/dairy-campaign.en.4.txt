Americans don't drink as much milk as they used to. Every year, they drink less and less milk. The people who make and sell milk have decided it is time to fight back. They are hoping to make milk a popular drink once again.

There are several ideas about what might help. One idea is to put milk in a new kind of container. Unlike regular containers, the new type will not need to be refrigerated until it is opened.

In 2013, U.S. milk sales were very low. The last time people were buying so little milk was in 1982.

## Three Reasons Why

Experts say there are three reasons why milk is not selling very well.

They say one reason is that people's shopping and eating habits have changed.

Another reason is that there are so many new drink choices. There are now all sorts of new sodas and juices. There are also new sports drinks.

A third reason is that milk has not changed. Some say new kinds of milk drinks should be offered.

Americans still buy as many gallons of drinks a year as they used to. They are just not drinking as much milk these days.

## Chocolate Milk, Move Over

Tom Gallagher runs a group called Dairy Management. His group works hard to get people to buy more milk. People may never drink as much milk as they did in the past, he said.

Gallagher says in the future, the average person may not even think about ordering milk to drink.

His group is working with seven other partners to make milk more popular. Dairy Farmers of America is one of the partners. It represents thousands of farmers nationwide.

Monica Massey is a vice president at Dairy Farmers of America. She thinks new kinds of milk drinks need to be created. She said flavored milk might help. She also likes the idea of making milk-based sports drinks.

## Let's Try This Again

Massey said milk companies have to understand what people look for when they choose a drink. For example, they may want something sweet. They may want a small, easy-to-carry container.

"We can't just put a gallon of milk on a shelf and hope someone buys it," she said.

Milk companies are trying to get children to drink more milk. They are guessing that funny containers might help. One new container is shaped like a cow's head.

Companies are also offering a new kind of packaging. It allows milk to be kept unrefrigerated. Businesses save money if they can keep milk without a refrigerator.

This is not the first time these groups have tried to get people to drink more milk. They have tried in the past, but failed.

Another problem is that people are eating fewer foods that use milk. People are eating less cold cereal, so they do not need as much milk.

Some companies are trying to help. Quaker Oats sells oatmeal. Its recipe used to say to mix the oats with water. Now it says to use milk instead.

A new way of making oatmeal doesn't sound like much. However, it could lead to a lot more milk being sold.
