COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France â€” On Friday, the sunny beaches of Normandy, France, celebrated peace.

Seventy years ago, the beaches were much different. On June 6, 1944, soldiers stormed the beaches in a mighty attack that helped change the course of World War II. It also helped shape our modern world.

In World War II, the Nazis and Hitler were trying to take over Europe. They had already taken parts of Europe, destroyed many cities and killed many people.

The United States joined a group of countries called the Allies to stop them. They attacked five Normandy beaches to push the Nazis out of France. Each beach was given a code name: Gold, Juno, Omaha, Sword and Utah.

## From Normandy To Paris

At least 4,400 Allied soldiers were killed the first day. Many thousands more died in the Battle of Normandy that followed.

Three months later, victory was finally won in Normandy. The Allies then marched to Paris to free the French capital from Nazi rule.

Not many of the 150,000 Allied soldiers who took part in D-Day are still alive. Some of the soldiers came to Normandy on Friday. They stood somber-faced and proud. With them were President Barack Obama, French President Francois Hollande and other world leaders.

All were there to honor the dead.

"Thank you for having been here in the summer of '44,'" said French President Hollande to the veterans. "Thank you for still being here on June 6, 2014." France's gratitude, he said, "will never be extinguished."

Earlier, Hollande had honored U.S. soldiers buried at the Normandy American Cemetery. "Long live the memory of those who fell here," he said. They fell "for our liberty."

## Honoring Their Sacrifice

President Obama spoke at Omaha Beach.

"Our commitment to liberty, to equality, to freedom," he said, "is written in blood on these beaches." It will last forever, he declared.

In all, 19 world leaders and more than 1,000 veterans gathered together on Friday. Many others joined them as well. They were all there to honor the troops who fell in battle. The sacrifice of those troops helped bring Europe peace and unity.

On Friday, several thousand veterans and family members gathered at the Normandy American Cemetery. The huge graveyard is a special place. Its 9,387 white marble tombstones sit on a hill overlooking Omaha Beach. It is where Americans come to honor U.S. troops killed in Normandy.

For the ceremony, small U.S. and French flags were placed in the ground at each grave.

Jeffrey McIllwain, an American teacher, brought 12 of his students to Normandy with him. McIllwain hopes to keep the memory of D-Day alive.

"I make them promise to bring their grandchildren," he said. They will "serve as a bridge to the next generation."
