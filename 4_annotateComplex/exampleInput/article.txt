WASHINGTON â€” National and state parks will be open this summer, but they won't be the same. The government is giving less money to parks. States will be sending fewer dollars too. The results won't be pretty. Trash cans may overflow. Visitors will have to wait in long lines to enter the parks. Children will miss out on campfire talks.

Millions of people visit state parks each year. Many had to cut staff and shorten hours back in 2008-2009. At that time, money was tight across the country. Some states have not undone those cuts. To make matters worse, even more cuts went into effect March 1. These cuts took away $150 million from the National Park Service.

The lost money will affect 401 national parks and monuments. The Park Service has put hiring on hold. Nine hundred jobs will go unfilled. The Park Service normally hires an extra 10,000 people to handle summer crowds. But this year, it will cut that number by 1,000. Fewer workers means less frequent mowing. It may also mean messy restrooms and not as many tours.

State parks have been dealing with tough times for several years.  However, some are in better shape than others.

## Donors Keep California Parks Open

In some states, donations have helped. California was able to keep open all of its state beaches, reserves and parks. Donors raised more than $3 million.

Even with the donations, California's state parks must do less. Repairs and mowing cannot happen as often. It must also trim park hours. Five hundred fewer rangers, scientists and other workers will be on the job, said Roy Stearns, a state parks spokesman.

Virginia Painter works for the parks commission in Washington. State parks there will have shorter hours and fewer guided tours, Painter said. Some park upkeep will be delayed, she added. Washington had to charge visitors a new entrance fee. But the fee has brought in only about half of the money that was expected. The park system has had to make other cuts to make do with less money.

National parks will face tough times too. At Grand Canyon National Park, the visitor center will open an hour later and close an hour earlier. Lines at the gates will be longer since there will be fewer workers. "We're going to do less with less," said park spokeswoman Maureen Oltrogge.

## Towns Hurt By Park Cutbacks

A study examined what parks do for the communities they surround. National parks bring billions of dollars to their nearby towns, the study found. Parks create 162,400 jobs. And that's not counting the jobs inside the parks.

Yellowstone National Park announced it would wait an extra two weeks to open two park entrances this year. The entrances were blocked by snow. Local businesses came to the rescue. The towns of Cody and Jackson earn millions of dollars from Yellowstone visitors. The towns figured the two-week closure would mean no visitors spending money in the hotels and restaurants. The communities would lose as much as $4 million. So people and businesses raised $175,000. They paid for snowplowing themselves and got the roads open on time.

After the snowplow savings, Yellowstone was still short $1.75 million. It met the gap by cutting jobs. Visitors at the huge park probably won't notice, said spokesman Dan Hottle.

Yosemite National Park is leaving about 20 jobs unfilled, said park spokesman Scott Gediman. Visitor centers will close an hour earlier. There will be no rangers in Mariposa Grove to show visitors the giant sequoia trees.

## Even Fourth Of July Affected

The Fourth of July will be quieter in Washington, D.C. A concert at the Washington Monument will be canceled. Litter will take longer to collect since the park cannot afford overtime cleanup.

At Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, six buildings will be closed. The park doesn't have the $1.2 million it needs to keep them open. Visitors will not be able to see where Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence. The Liberty Bell and Independence Hall are canceling evening visitor hours.

The Gulf Islands National Seashore in Florida and Mississippi is short $359,000. It plans to shut three visitor centers a few days each week.  Even some restrooms will be closed. Trash cans are history. Visitors will have to pack and take out their own garbage.
