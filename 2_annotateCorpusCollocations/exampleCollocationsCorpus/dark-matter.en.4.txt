lead
d
scientists
have
been
searching
for
something
for
years
and
years
they
believe
there
is
so
much
of
it
that
it
makes
up
a
quarter
of
the
<collocation>entire universe</collocation>
the
problem
is
they
don
t
know
what
it
looks
like
and
they
don
t
know
where
to
find
it
they
do
have
a
name
for
it
though
they
call
it
<collocation>dark matter</collocation>


the
idea
of
<collocation>dark matter</collocation>
was
suggested
by
scientists
to
explain
the
difference
between
how
they
expected
the
universe
to
behave
and
how
it
actually
acts


many
<collocation>modern theories</collocation>
about
the
universe
are
based
on
the
idea
that
<collocation>dark matter</collocation>
is
real
the
scientists
are
very
eager
to
find
even
the
tiniest
speck
of
it


the
<collocation>latest attempt</collocation>
to
find
<collocation>dark matter</collocation>
started
a
few
months
ago
it
is
happening
nearly
a
mile
underground
in
an
abandoned
gold
mine
on
wednesday
scientists
there
announced
what
they
had
found
nothing



no
wimps
here
yet

but
the
scientists
were
satisfied
anyway
they
said
they
had
developed
a
new
and
better
way
of
searching
for
the
<collocation>mysterious material</collocation>
so
they
plan
to
keep
looking


the
experiment
is
known
as
the
large
underground
<collocation>xenon experiment</collocation>
or
lux
it
is
the
most
advanced
search
for
<collocation>dark matter</collocation>
on
earth
a
detector
in
space
has
so
far
failed
to
find
any
of
the
stuff
either


the
<collocation>lux experiment</collocation>
is
taking
place
in
an
abandoned
gold
mine
in
south
dakota
the
lab
is
in
a
bright
clean
space
at
the
end
of
an
<collocation>old tunnel</collocation>
it
is
reached
by
a
minute
ride
in
an
elevator
that
once
carried
miners


there
a
<collocation>big advantage</collocation>
to
being
underground
some
feet
of
earth
help
screen
out
<collocation>background radiation</collocation>
<collocation>such radiation</collocation>
can
ruin
experiments


there
are
many
theories
about
what
<collocation>dark matter</collocation>
is
the
lux
team
hopes
to
find
it
in
a
form
with
a
strange
name
weakly
interacting
<collocation>massive particles</collocation>
the
particles
are
known
as
wimps


to
find
the
wimps
the
scientists
put
in
a
<collocation>large tank</collocation>
of
cooled
<collocation>xenon gas</collocation>
they
hope
to
spot
a
wimp
bouncing
off
the
center
of
one
of
the
xenon
<collocation>tiniest particles</collocation>



we
have
no
clue


but
nothing
has
been
found
yet
the
team
will
continue
looking
for
another
year
it
plans
to
build
better
equipment
and
to
use
a
<collocation>bigger tank</collocation>
of
xenon


the
biggest
problem
is
that
scientists
are
not
sure
what
<collocation>dark matter</collocation>
is
the
experiment
has
shown
that
some
ideas
were
wrong
though
and
there
are
a
lot
more
ideas
to
go
through



it
ghost
like
matter
<collocation>scientist daniel</collocation>
mckinsey
said


researchers
are
really
searching
in
the
dark
in
a
way
said
<collocation>scientist avi</collocation>
loeb
we
have
no
clue
we
don
t
know
what
this
matter
is


still
scientists
believe
about
one
quarter
of
the
universe
is
<collocation>dark matter</collocation>
this
is
five
times
as
much
as
<collocation>ordinary matter</collocation>
<collocation>ordinary matter</collocation>
is
what
makes
up
everything
we
see



which
way
to
go


scientists
are
pretty
sure
<collocation>dark matter</collocation>
exists
but
they
are
not
certain
what
it
is
made
of
and
they
don
t
know
how
it
interacts
with
<collocation>ordinary matter</collocation>
still
theories
about
how
the
universe
is
expanding
are
based
on
the
idea
that
<collocation>dark matter</collocation>
is
real
so
are
ideas
about
how
<collocation>galaxies move</collocation>
and
interact



we
know
there
stuff
out
there
that
is
something
else
said
<collocation>scientist neal</collocation>
weiner
and
that
makes
these
searches
hugely
important
because
we
know
we
are
missing
most
of
the
universe


so
why
hasn
t
<collocation>dark matter</collocation>
been
found
yet
it
could
be
that
the
scientists
machines
aren
t
good
enough


or
it
could
be
that
scientists
aren
t
looking
in
the
right
way
or
for
the
right
thing



perhaps
we
re
going
in
the
<collocation>wrong direction</collocation>
