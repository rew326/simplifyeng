syria
a
terrible
fight
has
been
going
on
inside
syria
a
country
in
the
<collocation>middle east</collocation>
the
war
has
now
lasted
for
five
years


fighters
are
trying
to
remove
<collocation>president bashar</collocation>
assad
the
country
leader
assad
and
his
men
have
been
fighting
back
the
fighting
happens
in
places
where
people
live


the
city
of
homs
in
syria
was
once
crowded
and
busy
now
not
much
of
it
is
left


everywhere
buildings
have
been
blown
up
the
streets
are
filled
with
broken
bits
and
pieces


many
people
have
left
the
city
some
have
moved
to
safer
parts
of
syria
or
to
other
countries


there
are
some
people
who
have
remained
in
homs
for
them
the
city
feels
strangely
empty
it
is
almost
a
<collocation>bit spooky</collocation>



friends
families
move
away

elia
samman
grew
up
in
homs
he
now
lives
in
another
syrian
city


samman
says
his
family
was
friendly
with
nine
other
families
in
homs
now
only
three
of
those
families
are
still
in
syria
the
rest
left
for
other
countries


the
same
thing
is
true
all
over
syria
more
than
million
people
have
left
the
country
another
million
have
moved
to
a
different
part
of
syria


in
some
parts
of
syria
life
has
not
changed
much
damascus
is
the
main
city
of
syria
it
is
still
crowded
with
people
people
still
fill
the
shops
and
families
still
go
out
for
<collocation>ice cream</collocation>

just
outside
damascus
things
are
very
different
shops
have
been
blown
up
gunfire
can
be
heard
on
the
streets
drivers
passing
through
on
roads
are
told
not
to
stop


things
are
bad
in
the
city
of
aleppo
too


fighting
goes
on
right
inside
aleppo
most
of
the
people
who
have
been
killed
were
not
even
fighters
they
just
happened
to
get
hit


many
of
the
stores
in
aleppo
have
closed
the
owners
were
afraid
they
would
get
killed


<collocation>mahmoud badawi</collocation>
is
different
he
still
keeps
his
small
shop
open


these
days
badawi
mostly
sells
to
assad
fighters
they
line
up
to
buy
food
and
drinks

says
he
will
be
staying

my
home
