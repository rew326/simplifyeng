still
waiting

the

people
are

it

heartbreak
hotel

the
resort
used
to
<collocation>host thousands</collocation>
of
people
each
day
now
the
number
is
usually
in
the
dozens
the
ruined
hotel
was
a
striking
white
modern
building
with
a
<collocation>curved roof</collocation>
it
was
different
from
the
typical
<collocation>boxy buildings</collocation>
found
in
pakistan
inside
the
lobby
were
fireplaces
<collocation>wood panels</collocation>
and
dark
<collocation>red carpeting</collocation>
guests
could
skate
on
the
<collocation>ice rink</collocation>
after
skiing
a
<collocation>souvenir shop</collocation>
sold
jars
of
honey
made
in
swat



it
was
a
beautiful
huge
hotel
and
it
was
always
full
ali
said
he
and
his
family
fled
swat
during
the
fighting
they
returned
four
months
later
to
find
the
hotel
destroyed
when
i
saw
it
my
heart
sank
it
was
so
beautiful
but
it
also
meant
we
had
jobs



tourists
remain
wary

the
military
is
still
guarding
swat
bases
and
checkpoints
ensure
that
the
taliban
doesn
t
return
swat
is
now
totally
cleared
of
the
taliban
said
syed
aqil
shah
<collocation>tourism minister</collocation>
for
the
<collocation>swat valley</collocation>
what
happened
to
malala
was
just
one
incident
that
made
people
start
talking
again
about
<collocation>swat security</collocation>



but
i
assure
you
that
swat
is
as
safe
as
any
other
place
in
pakistan
right
now


nonetheless
tourism
is
not
what
it
used
to
be


about
<collocation>tourists visit</collocation>
swat
per
year
said
zahid
khan
he
is
the
president
of
the
all
swat
<collocation>hotels association</collocation>
before
the
<collocation>taliban takeover</collocation>
there
were
visitors
a
year
almost
everyone
in
swat
earned
a
living
from
tourism
the
drop
in
visitors
has
hurt
nearly
<collocation>everyone khan</collocation>
said
<collocation>hotel workers</collocation>
cooks
taxi
drivers
and
<collocation>souvenir makers</collocation>
are
all
losing
money


according
to
khan
nobody
in
the
government
is
helping
his
requests
to
meet
with
top
officials
get
ignored
he
said
so
are
his
pleas
for
funding



more
bad
luck
for
swat

making
<collocation>matters worse</collocation>
the
valley
was
flooded
in
more
than
hotels
in
swat
were
damaged
or
destroyed
only
have
been
rebuilt


the
local
government
said
reconstruction
of
the
hotel
should
begin
this
summer
people
in
swat
say
they
have
heard
<collocation>such promises</collocation>
before
they
are
just
scraping
by



skiing
against
all
odds

the
resort
still
brings
some
joy
to
residents
skiing
is
all
they
have
to
fill
their
days
on
a
<collocation>recent cloudless</collocation>
afternoon
a
few
dozen
people
spent
hours
on
the
mountain
doing
jumps
one
skier
in
an
overcoat
whizzed
down
without
poles



it
such
a
<collocation>beautiful sport</collocation>
that
i
can
t
help
but
ski
every
day
said
saeed
alam
he
pushed
off
down
the
slope
on
the
back
of
his
jacket
were
the
words
ski
and
smile
in
swat
