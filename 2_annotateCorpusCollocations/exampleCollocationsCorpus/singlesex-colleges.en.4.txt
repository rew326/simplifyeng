<collocation>sweet briar</collocation>
and
<collocation>deep springs</collocation>
colleges
are
single
gender
schools
that
means
<collocation>sweet briar</collocation>
only
lets
women
enroll
<collocation>deep springs</collocation>
allows
only
men
there
are
not
many
colleges
like
these
left
in
the
united
states
many
are
struggling
to
stay
open
including
<collocation>sweet briar</collocation>
and
<collocation>deep springs</collocation>


some
people
wonder
if
single
gender
colleges
are
still
necessary


over
the
last
years
women
colleges
have
been
going
away
some
have
let
men
in
classes
others
have
just
closed
there
were
women
colleges
years
ago
now
there
are
only
the
information
comes
from
a
group
that
supports
women
colleges
called
the
women
<collocation>college coalition</collocation>
a
lot
of
the
women
only
colleges
went
away
in
the
late
and
early
that
was
when
many
men
only
schools
started
to
let
in
women



too
<collocation>few students</collocation>
at
<collocation>sweet briar</collocation>

the
people
who
run
<collocation>sweet briar</collocation>
said
in
february
that
the
school
would
close
this
summer
the
school
has
been
around
for
years
the
<collocation>announcement surprised</collocation>
teachers
at
the
school
administrators
said
the
fewer
students
were
attending
they
also
said
it
was
hard
to
get
<collocation>high schoolers</collocation>
interested
in
a
single
gender
college
another
problem
was
that
the
school
is
far
away
from
shops


people
later
learned
that
the
school
owes
a
lot
of
money
its
leaders
were
worried
about
not
being
able
to
pay
the
money
back
they
said
that
even
letting
male
students
go
to
the
school
would
not
help


the
teachers
from
the
school
went
to
court
they
asked
a
judge
to
stop
the
school
from
closing
graduates
of
the
school
also
are
protesting



schools
need
<collocation>good leaders</collocation>

some
single
sex
colleges
have
problems
but
they
can
still
stay
open
said
<collocation>david l</collocation>
warren
he
runs
a
group
that
represents
colleges
and
universities


the
people
who
run
the
schools
will
need
to
show
<collocation>good leadership</collocation>
for
the
schools
to
survive
he
said
they
must
want
to
keep
the
colleges
single
gender
he
said
they
will
also
need
<collocation>smart business</collocation>
plans
and
interesting
classes
warren
added


women
colleges
are
important
said
michele
ozumba
she
runs
the
women
<collocation>college coalition</collocation>
the
schools
can
help
women
become
leaders
she
said
minorities
and
students
who
are
the
first
in
their
families
to
go
to
college
may
especially
need
women
colleges
she
said



<collocation>deep springs</collocation>
college
is
unusual

unlike
<collocation>sweet briar</collocation>
<collocation>deep springs</collocation>
is
not
in
danger
of
closing
still
there
is
a
plan
for
the
school
to
change


the
tiny
two
year
school
has
been
around
since
its
male
students
do
not
pay
for
classes
they
follow
an
unusual
program
they
spend
their
time
reading
famous
books
and
pitching
hay
on
a
<collocation>big ranch</collocation>
many
later
go
to
top
colleges
for
four
year
degrees


in
the
people
who
run
<collocation>deep springs</collocation>
decided
to
let
women
in
a
men
only
school
was
no
longer
<collocation>good preparation</collocation>
for
the
students
futures
officials
said


those
plans
however
are
on
hold
for
now
some
graduates
of
the
school
are
taking
the
school
to
court
they
argue
that
the
school
should
not
be
allowed
to
enroll
women
the
school
was
started
to
educate
promising
young
men



judge
says
the
school
should
change

in
november
a
judge
ruled
that
the
<collocation>legal papers</collocation>
that
set
up
the
school
could
be
changed
the
school
mission
could
be
expanded
to
educating
promising
young
people


the
case
will
now
be
heard
by
a
<collocation>higher court</collocation>
the
school
says
there
are
no
plans
right
now
to
let
women
in
class


some
officials
at
the
few
men
colleges
left
defend
keeping
women
out
in
the
last
years
fewer
men
are
going
to
college
and
finishing
men
are
falling
behind
women
men
only
colleges
they
argue
can
help
fix
that
they
can
give
special
attention
to
those
male
students
the
officials
said
