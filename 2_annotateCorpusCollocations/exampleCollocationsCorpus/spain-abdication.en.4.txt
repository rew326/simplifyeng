who

there
have
also
been
clouds
for
the

carlos

reigned
since
more
than
other
<collocation>european kings</collocation>
he
has
had
to
fight
for
his
popularity



winning
the

of
spaniards

of
<collocation>don juan</collocation>
of
bourbon
and
battenberg
the
bourbon
family
was
overthrown
in
<collocation>francisco franco</collocation>
became
the
sole
ruler
of
spain
after
a
<collocation>civil war</collocation>


franco
decided
that
the
country
should
have
a
king
after
his
death
he
picked
<collocation>juan carlos</collocation>
<collocation>juan carlos</collocation>
was
at
the
time
and
returned
to
a
homeland
he
did
not
know


<collocation>juan carlos</collocation>
went
to
school
at
military
colleges
and
the
university
of
madrid
but
he
was
not
a
popular
choice
people
thought
he
would
do
whatever
franco
told
him
to
do
they
called
him
franco
puppet
<collocation>juan carlos</collocation>
was
once
attacked
with
tomatoes
when
touring
spain
when
he
was
crowned
most
people
didn
t
especially
care


still
<collocation>juan carlos</collocation>
won
the
hearts
of
spaniards
he
fought
for
democracy
he
supported
the
<collocation>democratic heads</collocation>
of
spanish
government
in
he
helped
defeat
an
attempted
takeover
of
spain
government
by
members
of
the
army


of
all
the
<collocation>modern european</collocation>
kings
or
queens
he
had
the
<collocation>greatest effect</collocation>
on
his
country



<collocation>good sense</collocation>
of
humor


you
have
to
earn
your
crown
every
day
<collocation>juan carlos</collocation>
told
his
<collocation>son felipe</collocation>


<collocation>juan carlos</collocation>
lived
a
low
key
lifestyle
in
the
zarzuela
palace
the
palace
is
not
much
bigger
than
a
large
home


<collocation>juan carlos</collocation>
was
friendly
and
easy
going
he
rule
was
not
very
formal
he
loved
sports
and
fast
cars
and
had
a
<collocation>good sense</collocation>
of
humor


his
relaxed
style
was
balanced
by
his
more
<collocation>formal wife</collocation>
his
wife
queen
sofia
was
born
in
greece
they
have
three
children
prince
felipe
and
princesses
elena
and
cristina


the
press
was
grateful
for
the
<collocation>democratic freedoms</collocation>
they
felt
the
king
was
partly
responsible
so
at
first
they
protected
the
<collocation>royal family</collocation>
they
did
not
publicize
their
mistakes


but
recently
the
press
stopped
protecting
the
king
in
news
about
an
<collocation>expensive hunting</collocation>
expedition
to
africa
appeared
in
spain
newspapers
the
elephant
<collocation>hunting trip</collocation>
took
place
in
the
middle
of
an
economic
crisis
nearly
one
quarter
of
spanish
workers
lost
their
jobs
<collocation>juan carlos</collocation>
apologized



not
in
<collocation>good health</collocation>

but
earlier
this
year
his
daughter
cristina
was
charged
with
cheating
on
her
taxes


there
were
also
questions
about
how
much
money
the
<collocation>royal family</collocation>
got
from
the
government
so
earlier
this
year
they
were
given
salaries


nor
was
his
position
as
king
always
appreciated
groups
in
several
parts
of
spain
want
to
separate
and
form
their
own
countries
for
them
he
is
a
symbol
of
a
country
to
which
they
do
not
want
to
belong


<collocation>juan carlos</collocation>
is
not
in
<collocation>good health</collocation>
but
even
as
it
became
worse
the
king
insisted
he
would
not
be
forced
off
the
throne


through
it
all
the
king
remained
popular
he
was
called
a
<collocation>role model</collocation>
for
other
<collocation>european royals</collocation>
he
knew
something
that
every
<collocation>royal family</collocation>
should
remember
that
kings
are
not
born
but
made
by
the
people
