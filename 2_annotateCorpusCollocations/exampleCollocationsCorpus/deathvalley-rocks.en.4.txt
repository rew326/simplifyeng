calif
the
cracking
sounds
were
loud
under
sunny
skies
an
ankle
deep
<collocation>frozen lake</collocation>
was
breaking
apart


the
<collocation>shallow lake</collocation>
here
in
<collocation>death valley</collocation>
<collocation>national park</collocation>
is
normally
dry
it
is
known
as
the
racetrack
playa
a
playa
is
an
area
of
flat
dried
up
land


<collocation>death valley</collocation>
is
the
hottest
<collocation>driest place</collocation>
on
earth
on
dec
of
last
year
though
the
playa
was
anything
but
dry


<collocation>cousins richard</collocation>
norris
and
<collocation>james norris</collocation>
were
observing
the
scene
both
are
scientists
as
they
watched
a
<collocation>light wind</collocation>
began
moving
<collocation>huge sheets</collocation>
of
ice
across
the
lake
surface



it
happening


soon
that
ice
was
ramming
into
large
rocks
pushed
by
the
ice
the
rocks
began
to
move
they
slid
slowly
across
the
lake
slick
<collocation>muddy bottom</collocation>



my
god
jim
it
happening
richard
yelled


<collocation>james norris</collocation>
grabbed
a
camera


their
photos
solved
a
mystery
that
had
puzzled
scientists
for
a
long
time
what
is
it
that
moves
the
rocks
across
the
racetrack
playa


the
rocks
that
are
sprinkled
around
the
playa
are
big
some
weigh
pounds
or
more


the
proof
that
the
rocks
are
moving
is
what
they
leave
behind
trails
in
the
dirt
the
trails
are
deep
but
no
other
tracks
are
visible


<collocation>different explanations</collocation>
of
how
the
rocks
move
had
been
suggested
however
until
that
day
last
december
no
one
had
been
able
to
prove
anything



ice
in
the
desert


i
m
amazed
<collocation>james norris</collocation>
said
the
playa
is
a
place
where
rainfall
averages
inches
a
year
yet
rocks
are
being
shoved
around
by
ice


scientists
have
been
studying
the
moving
rocks
since


one
reason
the
mystery
remained
is
that
the
rocks
only
move
occasionally
they
can
stay
still
for
many
years
until
certain
things
happen


the
first
<collocation>necessary step</collocation>
is
rain
falling
on
the
playa
next
temperatures
must
fall
low
enough
to
freeze
the
water
before
it
evaporates
then
the
sun
has
to
come
out
and
thaw
the
ice
once
the
<collocation>ice breaks</collocation>
into
chunks
wind
has
to
move
it
across
the
shallow
water
even
a
<collocation>light wind</collocation>
is
enough
to
get
the
ice
moving


the
norrises
began
trying
to
solve
the
mystery
in


over
the
next
two
years
they
placed
some
measuring
devices
around
the
playa
the
devices
would
show
them
whether
the
rocks
moved


on
dec
the
two
cousins
returned
to
inspect
their
devices
we
found
the
playa
covered
with
ice
<collocation>richard norris</collocation>
recalled
we
also
noticed
<collocation>fresh rock</collocation>
trails



rocks
get
a
push

the
following
afternoon
a
<collocation>light wind</collocation>
kicked
up
and
the
ice
started
cracking
<collocation>richard norris</collocation>
said
suddenly
everything
unfolded
before
our
eyes


the
cousins
later
learned
that
there
had
been
a
<collocation>rare winter</collocation>
storm
in
late
november
it
had
dropped
rain
and
snow
on
the
playa


following
that
storm
the
playa
was
turned
into
a
<collocation>shallow lake</collocation>
the
new
lake
froze
overnight
when
temperatures
dropped
on
<collocation>sunny days</collocation>
the
ice
began
to
break
into
sheets
as
<collocation>light winds</collocation>
sprung
up
the
ice
began
to
move
soon
the
stones
too
began
to
move


<collocation>james norris</collocation>
photos
make
everything
clear
large
but
<collocation>thin sheets</collocation>
of
ice
blew
into
rocks
pushed
by
the
ice
the
rocks
slid
along
the
slushy
<collocation>slippery mud</collocation>


the
paths
of
the
stones
were
set
by
the
direction
and
force
of
the
winds
once
the
lake
disappeared
those
paths
would
remain
as
trails


the
<collocation>norris cousins</collocation>
are
not
only
scientists
themselves
both
are
also
the
sons
of
famous
scientists
their
fathers
have
passed
away



wouldn
t
our
fathers
have
loved
to
have
known
this
<collocation>james norris</collocation>
said
about
their
discovery
