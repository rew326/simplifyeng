are
trying
to

they
want
to
find
out
why
there

starfish

get
involved


rangers
at
<collocation>olympic national</collocation>
park

noticed
the
problem
in
the
sickness
has
affected
different
types
of
starfish
the
animals
are
also
known
as
<collocation>sea stars</collocation>


the
<collocation>sea stars</collocation>
get
wounds
on
their
bodies
they
begin
curling
up
then
they
lose
their
legs
eventually
the
<collocation>sea stars</collocation>
turn
into
mush



they
are
dying
in
warmer
waters

scientists
say
a
disease
has
attacked
the
starfish
they
think
<collocation>climate change</collocation>
has
caused
the
disease
<collocation>climate change</collocation>
is
the
strange
changes
in
the
earth
weather
it
includes
the
earth
getting
warmer
over
time
the
starfish
disease
is
spreading
the
fastest
in
<collocation>warmer ocean</collocation>
waters


drew
harvell
is
a
professor
at
<collocation>cornell university</collocation>
she
has
been
studying
the
starfish
deaths
she
said
she
does
not
think
there
has
been
a
disease
that
has
hit
such
a
large
group
of
animals
before


congressman
denny
heck
wants
the
government
to
call
the
problem
an
emergency
he
wants
the
decision
to
be
made
before
the
starfish
all
die


right
now
there
is
no
way
for
the
government
to
handle
the
deaths
he
said



money
is
needed
now

heck
has
asked
congress
to
pass
a
law
it
is
called
the
<collocation>marine disease</collocation>
<collocation>emergency act</collocation>
it
would
force
u
government
agencies
to
make
a
plan
to
try
to
stop
the
starfish
deaths
the
government
would
also
have
to
give
scientists
money
for
research
it
is
not
clear
how
much
heck
plan
would
cost


heck
first
wants
congress
to
set
aside
million
that
money
will
be
used
to
get
government
agencies
to
<collocation>share research</collocation>
he
said
the
law
would
create
a
national
place
to
keep
information
then
research
could
be
shared
quickly


if
the
law
is
passed
it
also
would
set
up
a
<collocation>national volunteer</collocation>
group
to
advise
the
government
on
<collocation>marine disease</collocation>
emergencies
heck
plan
also
would
set
up
a
way
for
people
to
give
money
to
help
the
starfish



<collocation>bigger fish</collocation>
need
the
starfish
too

<collocation>congressman derek</collocation>

goo
he
said
making
sure
the
starfish
live
is
important
they
help
<collocation>bigger fish</collocation>

been
found
all
along
the
<collocation>west coast</collocation>

found
them
from

the
problem
had
not
been
studied
as

reported
in
many
states
there
maine
massachusetts
