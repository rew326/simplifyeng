genes
are
the
<collocation>building blocks</collocation>
of
the
<collocation>human body</collocation>
traits
get
passed
on
through
genes
from
one
generation
to
the
next
they
decide
what
<collocation>color eyes</collocation>
and
hair
someone
has
they
make
a
difference
in
how
tall
or
<collocation>thin someone</collocation>
is


genes
also
play
a
role
in
health
having
certain
genes
can
put
someone
at
risk
of
diseases
like
cancer


<collocation>scientific companies</collocation>
are
trying
to
find
such
genes
if
they
can
figure
out
which
genes
cause
<collocation>certain diseases</collocation>
they
can
make
tests
people
can
take
the
test
to
see
if
they
have
that
type
of
gene
the
companies
can
also
make
treatments
for
the
diseases


on
thursday
the
supreme
court
said
that
nobody
can
have
control
over
natural
genes
the
supreme
court
is
the
<collocation>highest court</collocation>
in
the
united
states
it
has
the
<collocation>final word</collocation>
on
american
laws



a
case
about
patents

one
company
called
<collocation>myriad genetics</collocation>
had
patents
on
two
genes
the
genes
could
show
if
someone
was
at
risk
of
cancer


a
patent
gives
an
<collocation>inventor control</collocation>
over
an
invention
only
the
person
or
company
with
the
patent
can
make
use
or
sell
the
invention
the
government
has
the
power
to
give
patents


some
scientists
felt
myriad
patents
were
making
their
work
impossible
they
wanted
to
study
new
ways
to
prevent
cancer
but
the
patents
meant
they
were
not
allowed
to
experiment
with
the
genes
they
decided
to
sue
their
case
went
all
the
way
to
the
supreme
court


the
court
decided
that
just
because
myriad
found
the
genes
does
not
mean
it
could
control
them
the
judges
said
the
company
should
not
have
been
given
the
patents


many
businesses
and
scientists
were
watching
the
case
billions
of
dollars
were
at
stake
having
the
patents
helped
myriad
earn
a
lot
of
money
myriad
could
charge
more
to
screen
for
the
genes
since
no
other
company
could
offer
the
same
test



ruling
affects
lots
of
<collocation>genetic research</collocation>

<collocation>lawyer sandra</collocation>
park
represented
the
scientists
who
sued



we
are
thrilled
park
said
the
question
before
the
court
was
a
simple
one
but
it
affects
lots
of
research
in
deep
ways


the
<collocation>ruling means</collocation>
that
it
will
be
easier
for
other
companies
to
make
cancer
tests
park
said
the
ruling
also
could
affect
patents
other
genes


scientists
said
the
ruling
will
be
good
for
patients
the
cost
of
the
<collocation>gene test</collocation>
will
probably
go
down


myriad
has
been
able
to
charge
about
for
its
cancer
test
the
company
said
that
most
patients
don
t
pay
that
amount
their
<collocation>insurance covers</collocation>
much
of
the
expense


myriad
lawyer
said
that
the
ruling
will
not
harm
the
company
in
a
major
way
the
company
has
many
other
patents
and
inventions


lawyer
vernon
winters
said
that
the
court
decision
has
limits
scientists
can
still
try
to
get
patents
they
can
get
them
for
discovering
new
ways
of
working
with
genes


the
court
also
said
scientists
can
get
patents
for
genes
they
make
in
a
laboratory
genes
that
are
naturally
in
the
<collocation>human body</collocation>
cannot
be
patented



balancing
reward
and
roadblock

attorney
barbara
rudolph
said
that
it
was
hard
to
predict
what
the
decision
will
mean
for
inventors
patents
should
make
people
want
to
come
up
with
new
inventions
but
patents
can
be
a
roadblock
to
more
discovery
the
court
wanted
to
try
to
find
balance
between
the
two
sides


justice
antonin
scalia
one
paragraph
opinion
showed
how
complicated
the
case
was
he
noted
there
were
many
<collocation>scientific details</collocation>
in
the
court
decision


scalia
said
he
didn
t
have
enough
knowledge
to
know
if
all
the
details
were
true
