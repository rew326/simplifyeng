his

going

his
<collocation>father russell</collocation>
yelled
have
fun


the
popes
live
in
<collocation>overland park</collocation>
kansas
there
has
been
very
little
snow
in
their
city
all
winter
<collocation>last week</collocation>
they
finally
got
a
chance
to
go
sledding


in
other
parts
of
the
country
too
little
snow
is
not
the
only
problem
something
else
has
been
keeping
many
kids
from
sledding
the
law


many
cities
these
days
are
passing
laws
against
sledding



maybe
wearing
helmets
will
help

dubuque
iowa
is
the
latest
city
to
do
that
in
january
sledding
was
not
allowed
in
almost
all
of
dubuque
parks
people
who
try
to
sled
anyway
will
have
to
pay
a
fine
other
cities
have
not
gone
that
far
some
are
banning
sledding
only
on
the
most
<collocation>dangerous hills</collocation>
others
are
making
<collocation>sledders wear</collocation>
helmets


sledding
is
risky
said
dubuque
city
lawyer
it
not
unusual
for
people
to
talk
about
their
accidents
or
near
accidents


thousands
of
kids
have
<collocation>sledding accidents</collocation>
each
year
some
of
those
accidents
are
very
serious



people
will
sled
anyway

some
cities
have
had
a
hard
time
banning
sledding


omaha
nebraska
outlawed
sledding
at
a
popular
hill
people
simply
ignored
the
new
law
the
city
then
decided
to
drop
it


instead
the
city
posted
warning
signs
it
put
bundles
of
hay
around
trees
and
pads
around
posts


<collocation>overland park</collocation>
has
also
tried
to
make
sledding
safer
padding
is
being
put
in
front
of
possibly
dangerous
things
on
monday
<collocation>hay bundles</collocation>
were
in
front
of
streetlights
near
the
<collocation>sledding hill</collocation>


<collocation>russell pope</collocation>
said
he
appreciates
the
added
safety
however
he
<collocation>hopes overland</collocation>
park
will
never
ban
sledding


the
safety
of
kids
is
the
most
important
thing
for
parents
he
said
however
some
fun
things
are
worth
taking
a
bit
of
a
chance



you
can
t
take
all
the
joy
out
of
being
a
kid
he
said
if
kids
don
t
go
sledding
in
the
winter
all
you
ve
got
is
your
ipad
and
spongebob
i
d
rather
they
get
out
there
and
get
some
exercise



parks
are
safer
for
sledding

some
say
the
new
ban
in
dubuque
has
made
sledding
more
dangerous
there
the
city
has
many
<collocation>steep streets</collocation>
kids
may
decide
to
sled
down
them
if
they
are
kept
out
of
parks



parents
ought
to
be
getting
out
there
yelling
said
law
<collocation>professor craig</collocation>
lawson
the
city
has
made
sledding
more
dangerous
for
kids


indeed
children
who
sled
on
the
street
are
much
more
likely
to
be
hurt


dubuque
sledding
ban
has
led
to
many
protests
for
example
two
grownup
brothers
slid
down
a
hill
holding
signs
the
words
don
t
tread
on
my
sled
were
written
on
one
sign


eleven
year
old
<collocation>lydia pope</collocation>
said
she
agrees
with
her
father
she
also
hopes
sledding
will
not
be
banned
in
<collocation>overland park</collocation>



i
wouldn
t
like
it
she
said
sledding
is
what
you
do
when
there
is
snow
