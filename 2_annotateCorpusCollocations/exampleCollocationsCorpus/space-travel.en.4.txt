people
dream
about
going
to
the
stars
scientist
konstantin
tsiolkovsky
wrote
that
people
will
eventually
live
in
space
he
said
that
earth
was
our
cradle
you
re
not
meant
to
stay
in
your
cradle
forever
said
tsiolkovsky


now
we
know
more
about
space
and
ourselves
we
might
not
be
able
to
move
into
space
after
all


a
big
problem
is
the
size
of
space
its
size
was
not
known
when
people
first
thought
about
going
to
the
stars
one
of
the
closest
stars
to
earth
is
billions
of
miles
away
it
is
much
farther
away
than
the
moon
people
cannot
travel
so
far
in
a
spaceship
it
would
take
too
many
years
instead
of
a
spaceship
we
would
have
to
make
an
ark
the
ark
would
need
to
be
big
enough
for
people
plants
and
animals



staying
healthy
in
space
wouldn
t
be
easy

the
size
of
the
ark
is
a
problem
the
ark
would
have
to
be
small
enough
to
move
at
a
high
speed
unfortunately
smallness
also
creates
problems
for
the
people
plants
and
animals


another
problem
is
keeping
our
<collocation>bodies healthy</collocation>
on
the
ark
traveling
to
the
stars
means
leaving
earth
without
knowing
what
might
happen
to
our
bodies
any
ark
would
be
a
test
the
people
would
be
lab
animals


there
would
need
to
be
rules
to
keep
the
test
working
having
children
would
be
required
to
keep
enough
people
living
in
the
ark
people
would
have
to
work
people
might
face
many
difficulties
following
the
rules



a
trip
to
the
stars
isn
t
impossible
but
it
unlikely

any
planets
the
voyagers
try
to
live
in
will
be
alive
or
dead
there
might
be
life
on
the
planet
the
life
could
be
harmless
or
it
could
be
deadly
the
planet
might
be
dead
then
the
people
will
have
to
make
it
livable
it
would
take
many
years
the
ark
would
have
to
continue
to
work
without
failing


a
trip
to
the
stars
is
not
impossible
still
there
are
many
problems
it
has
a
low
chance
of
working


<collocation>several steps</collocation>
would
need
to
happen
before
launching
people
into
space
on
an
ark
first
some
people
would
need
to
live
on
earth
like
they
would
on
the
ark
we
would
learn
from
how
the
people
live
the
first
step
is
the
most
important
second
there
would
need
to
be
practice
in
an
ark
going
around
our
sun
third
machines
would
need
to
travel
to
other
planets
in
space
to
see
if
people
can
live
in
any
of
them
