the
united
states
cut
off
contact
with
cuba
in
this
week
<collocation>president barack</collocation>
obama
cleared
the
way
for
building
a
new
relationship
between
the
two
countries


obama
said
he
plans
to
remove
cuba
from
the
list
of
countries
that
<collocation>support terrorism</collocation>


congress
has
days
to
consider
the
president
decision
lawmakers
would
need
to
take
a
vote
if
they
want
to
keep
cuba
on
the
list
the
obama
government
thinks
a
vote
is
not
likely


obama
said
most
americans
agree
with
him
about
fixing
the
relationship



cuba
says
it
is
against
terrorism

cuba
is
an
<collocation>island nation</collocation>
less
than
miles
from
florida
the
united
states
ended
its
friendship
after
cuban
<collocation>leader fidel</collocation>
castro
grabbed
power
castro
set
up
a
<collocation>communist form</collocation>
of
government
under
communism
people
have
little
freedom
they
do
not
elect
their
leaders
the
united
states
was
worried
about
communism
spreading
here


cuba
was
put
on
the
state
terrorism
list
in
at
the
time
cuba
wanted
to
spread
its
beliefs
to
other
countries



our
hemisphere
and
the
world
look
very
different
today
than
they
did
years
ago
said
u
secretary
of
<collocation>state john</collocation>
kerry
he
is
in
charge
of
the
united
states
relations
with
other
countries


if
cuba
is
taken
off
the
<collocation>terror list</collocation>
only
three
countries
remain
they
are
iran
sudan
and
syria


josefina
vidal
is
a
cuban
government
official
she
said
the
decision
to
take
cuba
off
the
<collocation>terror list</collocation>
is
fair
cuba
never
deserved
to
be
on
it
in
the
first
place
she
said


she
said
that
cuba
is
completely
against
terrorism


obama
told
congress
that
cuba
is
not
currently
supporting
<collocation>terrorism cuba</collocation>
has
promised
not
to
<collocation>support terrorism</collocation>
in
the
future



it
could
take
years
to
be
friends
again

kerry
said
that
the
united
states
disagrees
with
a
lot
of
what
cuba
does
still
cuba
actions
are
not
considered
to
be
terrorism
under
american
law


u
officials
said
repairing
the
relationship
could
take
years


one
of
the
first
steps
would
be
to
exchange
ambassadors
america
<collocation>official representative</collocation>
in
cuba
would
be
the
ambassador
the
two
countries
also
need
to
agree
on
other
issues
right
now
trade
and
travel
to
cuba
is
limited


lawmakers
in
congress
passed
the
trade
and
travel
rules
they
wanted
to
pressure
cuba
to
<collocation>end communism</collocation>
only
congress
can
lift
them
the
president
though
has
the
power
to
take
cuba
off
the
<collocation>terror list</collocation>
and
build
a
new
relationship


a
country
on
the
<collocation>terror list</collocation>
cannot
buy
weapons
from
the
united
states
it
also
cannot
receive
food
and
other
kinds
of
help



a
new
look
at
change

<collocation>senator richard</collocation>
j
durbin
of
illinois
helped
reach
the
agreement
with
cuba
he
said
that
he
is
not
a
fan
of
the
cuban
government
but
he
said
that
opening
up
the
island
to
american
ideas
and
products
is
the
best
way
to
change
cuba
ignoring
cuba
did
not
work


not
everyone
agrees
with
obama
decision
two
cuban
american
senators
want
to
keep
cuba
on
the
<collocation>terror list</collocation>
they
do
not
want
to
be
friends
with
cuba
while
it
is
a
communist
country
they
are
<collocation>senator robert</collocation>
menendez
from
<collocation>new jersey</collocation>
and
marco
rubio
from
florida
rubio
is
running
for
president


in
the
past
some
americans
fled
to
cuba
to
<collocation>escape criminal</collocation>
charges
in
the
united
states
the
senators
want
cuba
to
send
them
back
the
senators
say
cuba
must
stay
on
the
<collocation>terror list</collocation>
until
it
does


<collocation>senator john</collocation>
mccain
of
arizona
agrees
that
cuba
should
return
the
fugitives
but
it
not
going
to
happen
