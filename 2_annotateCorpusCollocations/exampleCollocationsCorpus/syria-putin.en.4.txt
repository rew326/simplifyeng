wrote
a
message
to
the
american
people
on
thursday
he
said
some
tough
things
about
<collocation>president barack</collocation>
obama
speech
on
syria
he
also
basically
called
the
united
states
a
bully
the
article
appeared
in
the
<collocation>new york</collocation>
times


the
russian
president
mentioned
god
he
mentioned
the
pope
and
the
rule
of
law
he
wrote
about
when
the
united
states
and
russia
were
on
the
same
side
they
<collocation>beat nazi</collocation>
germany
in
<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii


he
said
he
studied
what
obama
said
<collocation>tuesday night</collocation>
he
disagrees
with
the
president


but
putin
also
said
trust
between
him
and
obama
is
growing
he
welcomed
obama
willingness
to
work
with
russia
the
two
countries
are
working
on
a
plan
to
deal
peacefully
with
syria
supply
of
<collocation>poison gas</collocation>
syria
would
give
up
the
gas
it
would
eventually
be
destroyed



u
and
russia
not
talking
enough

avoiding
force
in
syria
will
strengthen
the
trust
between
russia
and
the
united
states
he
wrote
it
will
be
our
shared
success
and
open
the
door
to
cooperation
on
other
important
problems


the
article
was
published
in
the
newspaper
<collocation>opinion section</collocation>
the
section
is
separate
from
where
the
news
is
published


<collocation>foreign leaders</collocation>
do
not
usually
write
in
an
american
newspaper
to
try
to
change
what
the
u
public
thinks
but
it
happens
putin
said
that
the
anger
over
syrian
<collocation>chemical weapons</collocation>
prompted
me
to
speak
directly
to
the
american
people
and
their
<collocation>political leaders</collocation>


people
in
the
two
countries
are
not
talking
to
each
other
enough
he
said


putin
warned
the
united
states
against
attacking
syria
on
its
own
obama
has
threatened
to
do
so
because
of
the
syrian
government
supposed
use
of
<collocation>chemical weapons</collocation>
in
its
<collocation>civil war</collocation>
few
countries
support
an
attack
the
united
nations
would
seem
less
important
if
the
united
states
acted
on
its
own
putin
said
an
attack
would
also
be
against
international
law
he
wrote



says
<collocation>america relies</collocation>
on
<collocation>brute force</collocation>


the
law
is
still
the
law
and
we
must
follow
it
whether
we
like
it
or
not
he
said
<collocation>human rights</collocation>
campaigners
in
russia
will
take
a
close
look
at
those
words
they
say
putin
government
bends
the
law
to
serve
its
<collocation>own purposes</collocation>


putin
said
it
has
become
commonplace
for
the
united
states
to
get
involved
in
other
countries
and
their
fights
he
did
not
see
this
as
a
good
thing
saying
millions
around
the
world
increasingly
see
america
not
as
a
model
of
democracy
but
as
relying
solely
on
<collocation>brute force</collocation>


the
russian
president
ended
by
talking
about
obama
speech
the
american
president
laid
out
the
reasons
for
attacking
syria
obama
also
said
he
wanted
to
explore
russia
idea
for
a
peaceful
end
to
the
crisis
too
he
explained
that
the
united
states
had
a
history
it
was
a
leader
when
there
were
<collocation>serious global</collocation>
problems
obama
said



that
what
makes
america
different
the
u
president
said
that
what
makes
us
exceptional


putin
said
he
did
not
agree
with
the
case
he
made
on
<collocation>american exceptionalism</collocation>
it
is
extremely
dangerous
to
encourage
people
to
see
themselves
as
exceptional
whatever
the
motivation
he
concluded
that
we
must
not
forget
that
god
created
us
equal
