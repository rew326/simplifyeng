zwickau
germany
in
a
town
in
germany
four
young
people
walk
around
a
<collocation>christmas market</collocation>
music
and
the
smell
of
cookies
floats
through
the
air


the
little
group
is
part
of
the
<collocation>habashieh family</collocation>
they
are
from
syria
a
country
in
the
<collocation>middle east</collocation>
the
family
moved
to
germany
because
it
is
safer
than
syria
there
is
a
war
in
syria
many
people
have
escaped
and
are
looking
for
a
better
life
in
germany


the
habashiehs
are
refugees
a
refugee
is
someone
who
leaves
their
country
because
it
is
unsafe
for
them
to
live
there
there
are
many
refugees
in
germany
many
of
them
came
from
syria
they
are
looking
for
safer
lives


a
violent
group
called
the
<collocation>islamic state</collocation>
is
trying
to
take
over
the
<collocation>middle east</collocation>
it
has
already
taken
over
part
of
syria
and
iraq
the
people
who
live
there
are
in
danger
many
of
them
leave
trying
to
find
a
new
home



family
journey
was
dangerous

life
in
germany
is
safer
life
there
is
not
easy
though
when
many
refugees
first
arrive
it
is
hard
to
adjust
when
the
habashiehs
entered
germany
life
was
hard
they
lived
in
a
small
shelter
crowded
with
people
there
was
no
school
for
the
children
they
lived
in
fear
of
being
attacked


now
life
for
their
family
is
good
they
have
a
<collocation>small apartment</collocation>
for
themselves
they
even
decorated
for
christmas
little
by
little
the
habashiehs
are
settling
into
their
new
life


the
habashiehs
journey
to
get
to
germany
was
not
easy
they
had
to
risk
their
lives
to
escape
syria
all
that
feels
like
a
bad
dream
now



some
germans
unhappy
about
refugees

today
the
habashiehs
are
fixing
up
their
new
home
they
spend
time
together
as
a
family
they
even
go
to
school
together
and
are
learning
german


germans
have
different
feelings
about
the
refugees
at
first
they
were
nice
germans
welcomed
the
refugees
to
their
country
some
now
feel
differently
many
germans
have
become
unhappy
that
so
many
outsiders
are
moving
to
their
country


even
though
it
has
been
hard
the
habashiehs
are
making
the
most
of
their
life
in
germany
they
lived
in
berlin
a
big
city
for
their
first
two
weeks
in
germany
there
were
more
syrians
there
they
hope
to
one
day
make
their
home
in
berlin
