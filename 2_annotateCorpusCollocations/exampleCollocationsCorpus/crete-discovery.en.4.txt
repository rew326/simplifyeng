kavousi
greece
in
june
the
digging
began
again
slowly
but
surely
an
ancient
city
lost
for
thousands
of
years
is
being
uncovered
the
city
is
in
crete
an
island
off
greece
in
the
<collocation>mediterranean sea</collocation>


archaeologists
scientists
who
study
<collocation>ancient peoples</collocation>
and
american
students
were
at
the
dig
they
were
there
in
hopes
of
discovering
clues
about
life
in
the
city
of
azoria
the
ancient
city
was
destroyed
by
fire
about
years
ago
very
little
is
known
about
it
now


bits
of
writing
have
been
found
on
pottery
at
the
dig
while
interesting
to
see
the
writing
isn
t
much
help
because
the
language
of
azoria
has
been
lost
clues
must
be
gathered
from
what
remains
of
the
city
the
students
and
<collocation>archaeologists look</collocation>
at
parts
of
buildings
pots
tools
and
food


the
project
is
the
life
work
of
archaeologist
<collocation>donald haggis</collocation>



directing
the
digging

digging
is
only
allowed
for
six
weeks
a
year
but
haggis
has
been
at
it
since
a
lot
of
work
has
already
been
done


today
on
the
hilltop
there
are
a
couple
of
dozen
students
and
archaeologists
they
are
<collocation>busy digging</collocation>
around
the
remains
of
several
buildings



it
fun
whacking
away
joked
<collocation>student chelsea</collocation>
bright
who
plans
to
become
an
archaeologist
it
like
you
re
a
lumberjack


so
far
<collocation>several houses</collocation>
and
public
buildings
have
been
unearthed
haggis
serves
as
leader
directing
the
digging


azoria
was
first
discovered
in
but
wasn
t
considered
very
important
as
a
result
no
one
paid
much
attention
to
it
for
years



<collocation>ancient azorian</collocation>
pottery

but
in
haggis
decided
that
azoria
might
be
worth
a
closer
look


what
gave
haggis
that
idea
was
some
<collocation>azorian pottery</collocation>
he
discovered
the
pottery
convinced
him
that
the
city
was
much
older
than
people
thought
it
was
he
concluded
that
azoria
would
be
important
to
study


azoria
was
a
small
city
with
a
population
of
to
people


there
had
been
settlements
on
the
mountaintop
of
azoria
for
centuries
however
a
full
blown
city
did
not
develop
until
around
b
c


around
b
c
the
city
was
destroyed
by
a
<collocation>terrible fire</collocation>
probably
set
by
invaders
eventually
it
became
lost
in
time



olives
grapes
and
grains

among
the
discoveries
made
so
far
is
a
building
where
shared
public
meals
were
probably
eaten
the
building
includes
dining
rooms
and
kitchens
storerooms
contain
the
remains
of
foods
grapes
olives
and
grains


the
dig
has
also
uncovered
something
called
the
monumental
civic
building
it
has
a
<collocation>large hall</collocation>


it
is
the
first
time
that
two
large
public
buildings
of
the
period
have
been
unearthed
they
suggest
that
many
of
the
men
ate
together
perhaps
they
shared
meals
because
all
were
soldiers


each
year
american
students
most
of
them
<collocation>future archaeologists</collocation>
come
to
dig
at
azoria
this
summer
of
them
are
here


the
work
the
students
do
is
not
easy
the
sun
gets
very
hot
and
they
end
up
covered
from
head
to
toe
with
dirt
and
dust



a
hard
day
work

most
students
start
work
at
a
m
and
finish
by
midafternoon
by
then
the
sun
is
too
hot
to
work
under
still
the
more
experienced
students
work
late
into
the
afternoon
their
job
is
to
carefully
record
the
day
findings


most
students
find
the
work
very
difficult
but
some
really
enjoy
it



i
love
the
history
and
the
experience
said
<collocation>student julie</collocation>
juhasz
also
she
added
there
is
something
satisfying
about
swinging
a
<collocation>huge pick</collocation>


for
those
working
at
the
dig
uncovering
the
past
is
an
<collocation>exciting experience</collocation>
juhasz
found
that
out
when
she
discovered
a
pot


her
find
made
her
feel
close
to
the
past
it
was
like
being
connected
to
someone
who
died
years
ago
