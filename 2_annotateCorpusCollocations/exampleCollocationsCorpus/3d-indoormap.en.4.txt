the
young
scientists
in
this
<collocation>basement laboratory</collocation>
are
all
gathered
around
a
smartphone
they
aren
t
on
break
this
is
their
work


their
<collocation>computer science</collocation>
professor
is
holding
the
phone
he
is
walking
through
the
university
of
minnesota
walter
library


as
he
walks
a
d
map
of
the
library
appears
on
the
phone
screen


the
professor
and
his
students
are
working
with
google
to
develop
smartphones
that
can
easily
make
d
maps
google
gave
the
university
million
to
work
on
this
technology



advanced
map
technology

nowadays
many
people
use
<collocation>google maps</collocation>
for
directions
indoor
d
maps
would
have
many
possibilities


these
maps
could
help
you
find
your
classroom
in
a
huge
school
or
find
a
<collocation>coffee shop</collocation>
in
an
airport


there
are
also
other
uses
people
trying
to
sell
their
house
could
make
<collocation>digital tours</collocation>
the
technology
could
help
blind
people
walk
through
a
building


the
technology
is
new
and
very
advanced
still
the
scientists
hope
it
can
work
on
smartphones
people
already
own


professor
stergios
roumeliotis
has
been
working
on
map
technology
since
he
says
this
new
technology
could
be
as
important
as
<collocation>google maps</collocation>



this
new
software
could
become
the
<collocation>google maps</collocation>
of
the
<collocation>indoor world</collocation>
roumeliotis
said
this
is
where
we
spend
most
of
our
time


the
university
of
minnesota
software
is
important
for
two
reasons
first
it
creates
a
map
almost
instantly
second
it
does
this
without
slowing
down
the
phone
or
using
too
much
<collocation>battery power</collocation>


to
do
that
the
university
of
minnesota
team
had
to
try
some
creative
<collocation>design ideas</collocation>



cellphone
camera
and
sensor

most
<collocation>map software</collocation>
<collocation>uses global</collocation>
positioning
satellite
gps
signals
this
new
software
doesn
t
instead
it
uses
the
phone
camera
and
built
in
motion
sensor


scientists
at
the
university
of
minnesota
worked
with
nasa
in
the
past
to
help
navigate
mars
<collocation>landing vehicles</collocation>
now
they
are
using
that
knowledge
for
the
d
<collocation>mapping project</collocation>


it
not
unusual
for
google
to
reach
out
to
universities
for
help
in
creating
new
technology
explained
<collocation>scott strawn</collocation>
strawn
job
is
to
closely
follow
what
tech
companies
like
google
are
doing


there
is
a
lot
of
brainpower
at
universities
strawn
said
that
what
google
needs
to
move
these
projects
forward


mapping
the
mall
of
america
today
would
take
many
computers
and
a
lot
of
time
roumeliotis
said



our
plan
is
to
do
that
on
a
cellphone
in
almost
real
time
he
added
we
re
on
the
frontier
of
this
kind
of
mapping
