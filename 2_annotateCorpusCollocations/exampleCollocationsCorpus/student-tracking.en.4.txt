the
cafeteria


principals
in
thousands
of
schools
know
the
answer
new

lets
schools
keep
track
of
students
some

have
kids
carry
<collocation>id cards</collocation>
that
have
<collocation>computer chips</collocation>
in
them
other
schools
track
kids
by
their
fingerprint
or
they
scan
their
eyeball
or
palm


schools
use
the
devices

take
attendance
they
let
parents
know
where
their
children
get
off
the
school
bus
they
can
even
speed

people
want
to
learn
more
about
it

the
technology
is
supposed
to
make
schools
safer
and
run
better
not
everyone
thinks
it
is
a
<collocation>good idea</collocation>
parents
and
lawmakers
are
worried
about
this
technology
they
want
to
know
what
information
the
schools
have
about
students
and
how
that
information
is
protected
several
states
are
now
stopping
or
limiting
its
use
in
schools


this
year
florida
became
the
first
state
to
stop
<collocation>biometric technology</collocation>
in
schools
<collocation>biometric devices</collocation>
recognize
a
person
by
a
fingerprint
or
eyeball


other
states
have
passed
similar
laws
<collocation>new hampshire</collocation>
and
missouri
schools
decided
that
students
cannot
be
forced
to
carry
cards
that
track
them
the
cards
have
<collocation>computer chips</collocation>
inside
they
use
<collocation>radio frequency</collocation>
identification
rfid
the
chips
can
be
read
by
a
scanner
or
they
send
out
a
<collocation>radio signal</collocation>
the
u
<collocation>postal service</collocation>
<collocation>uses rfid</collocation>
for
<collocation>tracking packages</collocation>


this
year
at
least
states
passed
laws
stopping
or
limiting
the
<collocation>tracking technology</collocation>
says
the
data
quality
campaign
it
is
a
group
that
supports
the
new
technology



technology
is
moving
so
fast
said
paige
kowalski
who
works
for
data
quality
campaign
i
think
that
why
you
re
seeing
these
new
laws
i
think
people
are
nervous
about
it
it
new



you
can
t
lose
your
finger


jay
fry
used
to
be
a
school
principal
in
illinois
he
came
up
with
the
idea
of
using
biometrics
in
schools
in
he
noticed
students
often
lost
their
lunch
money
or
their
<collocation>id cards</collocation>


fry
said
<collocation>biometric technology</collocation>
is
used
in
more
than
<collocation>school districts</collocation>
in
states
he
said
it
is
safer
than
a
<collocation>student id</collocation>
card
if
a
student
loses
his
<collocation>id card</collocation>
someone
else
could
pick
it
up
his
company
scans
a
student
<collocation>finger print</collocation>
you
can
t
lose
your
finger
he
said


however
some
lawmakers
do
not
like
the
idea
they
question
whether
schools
really
need
the
technology



the
information
should
be
safe

dorothy
hukill
is
lawmaker
in
florida
she
helped
pass
the
law
to
stop
the
use
of
biometrics
in
florida
schools
she
said
students
should
not
need
it
to
buy
a
<collocation>hot dog</collocation>
or
check
out
a
<collocation>library book</collocation>


hukill
said
she
is
not
against
technology
however
she
is
worried
about
keeping
kids
and
their
information
safe


kowalski
from
data
quality
campaign
said
the
<collocation>tracking technology</collocation>
should
be
allowed
but
lawmakers
should
make
sure
that
parents
know
how
their
schools
are
using
it
and
how
it
is
protected


if
lawmakers
stop
rfids
they
may
be
taking
something
useful
away

said
