u
<collocation>teen clothing</collocation>
retailers
are
closing
stores
lots
of
stores


for
years
teens
have
hung
out
at
the
stores
in
the
malls
they
were
looking
for
<collocation>trendy clothes</collocation>
now
retailers
such
as
<collocation>american eagle</collocation>
outfitters
abercrombie
amp
fitch
and
aeropostale
don
t
think
they
need
so
<collocation>many stores</collocation>


the
stores
used
to
be
hot
they
set
the
fashion
trends
for
<collocation>high schoolers</collocation>
now
they
are
trying
to
change
how
and
where
they
sell
clothes


teens
today
use
smartphones
to
shop
they
buy
things
online
just
as
easily
as
in
stores
so
retailers
need
to
help
them
shop
by
phone
they
also
need
to
sell
new
styles
faster
their
prices
have
to
be
what
teens
will
pay


the
retailers
may
have
been
slow
to
act
but
they
are
taking
the
problem
seriously



lots
of
clothes
are
still
being
sold

<collocation>brian tunick</collocation>
is
an
expert
on
retail
for
the
banking
firm
jpmorgan
he
said
lower
priced
chains
picked
up
sales
from
to
so
did
fast
fashion
retailers
like
forever
h
amp
m
and
uniqlo
they
ve
done
well
by
selling
<collocation>inexpensive fashion</collocation>
they
also
change
the
clothes
they
sell
frequently


many
of
these
retailers
are
based
in
other
countries
they
ve
now
opened
lots
of
stores
in
the
united
states


meanwhile
the
american
<collocation>teen clothing</collocation>
retailers
were
following
the
example
of
some
of
those
<collocation>international retailers</collocation>
they
opened
a
lot
of
stores
around
the
world
their
stores
in
other
countries
have
done
well
most
u
retailers
plan
to
open
more
overseas


but
they
still
have
lots
of
stores
in
north
america
and
they
need
to
figure
out
what
to
do
with
them
teens
spent
less
from
to
that
period
was
known
as
the
<collocation>great recession</collocation>
many
people
lost
jobs
and
had
less
money
to
spend
lately
there
are
not
a
lot
of
new
<collocation>clothing styles</collocation>
that
teens
want
that
has
also
hurt
sales



maybe
there
are
too
<collocation>many stores</collocation>

the
answer
seems
clear
more
stores
aren
t
always
the
way
to
sell
more


<collocation>american eagle</collocation>
said
it
has
stores
to
close
in
north
america
in
the
next
three
years
it
is
closely
watching
more
the
stores
have
leases
which
are
contracts
to
rent
the
stores
because
the
leases
are
ending
the
stores
can
be
closed


tunick
said
that
abercrombie
had
closed
locations
since
<collocation>pacific sun</collocation>
had
closed
stores
aeropostale
is
expected
to
close
up
to
in
the
next
few
years
he
said


the
cuts
aren
t
done
abercrombie
recently
said
it
is
on
track
to
close
to
stores
this
year
as
<collocation>leases end</collocation>
thomas
a
<collocation>filandro works</collocation>
for
a
company
called
susquehanna
<collocation>financial group</collocation>
he
<collocation>watches retail</collocation>
companies
he
pointed
out
that
more
than
of
abercrombie
<collocation>store leases</collocation>
end
by
after
the
<collocation>leases end</collocation>
the
company
can
close
the
stores
if
it
wants


<collocation>randal j</collocation>
konik
is
another
expert
on
retail
he
said
almost
one
third
of
<collocation>teen store</collocation>
space
could
be
closed
over
the
next
three
years



people
will
always
want
to
walk
into
a
store

still
things
aren
t
all
bad
for
companies
that
own
<collocation>shopping centers</collocation>
things
hit
a
<collocation>low point</collocation>
in
and
now
most
<collocation>shopping center</collocation>
space
is
full
said
jesse
tron
he
works
for
a
group
that
<collocation>supports shopping</collocation>
centers


tron
noted
percent
of
sales
in
the
united
states
are
still
made
in
stores
the
rest
are
made
online
or
through
smartphones
or
tablets


retailers
are
looking
to
combine
online
and
<collocation>offline stores</collocation>
that
may
lead
to
more
stores
closing
but
tron
says
other
retailers
like
uniqlo
and
h
amp
m
are
opening
stores
also
some
online
only
sellers
are
finding
they
want
physical
spaces
to
get
more
attention
and
give
customers
a
different
<collocation>shopping experience</collocation>



experience
is
likely
to
be
a
popular
word
going
forward
<collocation>retailers hope</collocation>
to
make
stores
welcoming
and
the
<collocation>visits worth</collocation>
the
effort
