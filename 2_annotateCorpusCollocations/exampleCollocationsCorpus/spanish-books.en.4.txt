<collocation>los angeles</collocation>
for
many
years
finding
spanish
language
books
in
the
u
was
tough


bookstores
sold
few
titles
and
those
they
had
were
very
expensive
take
for
example
a
<collocation>paperback copy</collocation>
of
don
quixote
in
the
<collocation>original spanish</collocation>
that
could
easily
cost
three
times
the
price
of
a
fancy
hardcover
translation
in
english
if
it
could
be
found
at
all


booksellers
said
the
high
prices
were
unavoidable
importing
books
printed
in
spain
and
<collocation>latin america</collocation>
was
expensive


for
a
time
u
publishers
tried
translating
<collocation>english language</collocation>
bestsellers
into
spanish
but
these
books
were
done
poorly
often
they
had
<collocation>translation mistakes</collocation>
so
they
didn
t
sell
well
soon
many
u
publishers
pretty
much
gave
up
trying
to
reach
the
spanish
speaking
market



<collocation>spanish titles</collocation>
up
costs
down

it
became
frustrating
readers
of
spanish
language
books
could
find
little
to
buy
and
this
was
true
even
in
cities
such
as
<collocation>los angeles</collocation>
where
there
are
many
latinos



there
was
a
tremendous
appetite
for
spanish
language
books
said
<collocation>los angeles</collocation>
<collocation>bookseller david</collocation>
kipen
and
it
wasn
t
being
met


but
lately
the
nation
million
<collocation>spanish speakers</collocation>
have
a
lot
more
to
read
the
internet
is
mostly
to
thank
for
it
and
the
<collocation>quick spread</collocation>
of
<collocation>portable digital</collocation>
reading
devices
these
include
amazon
kindle
and
barnes
amp
noble
nook


for
the
first
time
spanish
language
<collocation>electronic books</collocation>
or
e
books
can
be
found
easily
in
the
u
and
they
are
often
cheap
compared
to
printed
books


the
last
two
years
have
seen
a
lot
of
change
the
number
of
spanish
language
titles
has
tripled
at
some
<collocation>online booksellers</collocation>


and
costs
have
gone
way
down
imported
hardcovers
once
could
sell
for
more
than
now
<collocation>digital versions</collocation>
can
be
bought
online
for
less
than



more
latinos
with
e
readers

spanish
language
<collocation>book sales</collocation>
in
the
u
are
still
small
overall
they
make
up
a
very
small
amount
of
the
nation
<collocation>book sales</collocation>
each
year
but
they
are
growing
rapidly


consider
one
eager
reader
luis
alcaraz
a
native
of
mexico
now
living
in
las
vegas
he
bought
his
kindle
four
years
ago
at
the
time
he
said
there
was
practically
<collocation>nothing available</collocation>
to
download
in
spanish


alcaraz
said
that
things
are
very
different
now
he
can
easily
find
many
<collocation>interesting electronic</collocation>
titles
in
spanish
these
include
specialized
books
on
computers
and
also
the
<collocation>science fiction</collocation>
stories
he
likes
to
read
during
<collocation>airplane flights</collocation>



there
just
been
an
<collocation>incredible change</collocation>
said
alcaraz


his
experience
is
not
unusual
latinos
are
buying
<collocation>tablet computers</collocation>
and
e
readers
far
faster
than
the
u
population
as
a
whole
in
about
in
hispanics
owned
such
a
device
in
the
number
had
jumped
to
nearly
in



inquebrantable
hits
no


before
there
were
only
about
spanish
language
books
offered
online
this
was
out
of
a
total
of
about
<collocation>spanish titles</collocation>
worldwide


today
many
more
spanish
language
books
can
be
found
online
there
are
nearly
e
books
in
spanish
on
barnes
amp
noble
website
and
the
story
is
the
same
over
on
amazon
spanish
language
page
it
now
has
more
than
titles
that
more
than
double
the
number
it
had
in
april


and
all
this
growth
has
had
a
<collocation>surprising effect</collocation>
it
has
helped
sales
of
printed
books
in
spanish
go
up
as
well
publishers
and
booksellers
now
realize
that
many
people
are
eager
for
books
in
spanish
the
old
fashioned
printed
kind
too


take
the
independent
<collocation>publishers group</collocation>
it
has
seen
sales
of
spanish
language
print
books
go
way
up
they
have
made
a
lot
more
money
over
the
last
five
years


and
in
july
the
paperback
version
of
inquebrantable
written
by
singer
jenni
rivera
hit
the
no
spot
on
all
of
amazon
com
it
outsold
every
other
book
that
month
