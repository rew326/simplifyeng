<collocation>christopher swain</collocation>
is
about
to
swim
in
the
<collocation>gowanus canal</collocation>
in
<collocation>new york</collocation>
city
the
canal
has
some
of
the
most
<collocation>polluted water</collocation>
in
america


swain
has
a
purpose
for
swimming
in
the
<collocation>stinky water</collocation>
he
hopes
to
<collocation>draw attention</collocation>
to
it


people
have
gathered
around
to
watch



i
ll
jump
in
if
you
ll
jump
in
someone
calls
out
to
her
friend
across
the
canal
no
one
accepts
the
dare
only
swain
is
crazy
enough
to
go
in
the
<collocation>yucky water</collocation>



this
water
is
really
gross

the
canal
is
filled
with
many
different
kinds
of
pollution
sewer
pipes
dump
toilet
waste
right
into
the
canal
factories
dump
in
<collocation>poisonous waste</collocation>


before
jumping
into
the
stinking
water
swain
puts
on
special
swim
gear
swimming
cap
goggles
ear
plugs
thick
gloves
a
<collocation>special suit</collocation>
to
keep
water
out
gel
on
his
neck
and
face
to
block
water



i
don
t
ever
worry
about
being
in
the
water
says
swain
he
is
years
old
and
has
gone
swimming
in
<collocation>polluted water</collocation>
before
he
explained
that
his
suit
protects
him
like
a
bubble
still
swain
carefully
keeps
his
head
above
the
water
as
he
swims



it
just
like
swimming
through
a
dirty
diaper
he
says



tons
of
garbage
in
the
canal

the
<collocation>gowanus canal</collocation>
has
been
used
as
a
dumping
place
for
factories
for
more
than
years


the
main
thing
polluting
the
canal
is
probably
<collocation>coal tar</collocation>
coal
is
mined
from
the
earth
it
was
used
to
make
gas
for
old
<collocation>street lamps</collocation>
<collocation>coal tar</collocation>
was
left
over
when
the
gas
was
made
people
dumped
the
<collocation>coal tar</collocation>
into
the
canal
for
many
years



not
so
<collocation>good flavors</collocation>

the
u
environmental
protection
agency
is
part
of
the
government
it
is
in
charge
of
protecting
the
environment
the
<collocation>agency plans</collocation>
to
clean
up
the
canal
it
will
dig
up
mud
from
the
bottom
then
it
will
burn
it


the
epa
warns
people
about
the
<collocation>gowanus canal</collocation>
do
not
touch
the
water
or
the
mud


swain
did
both



i
didn
t
drink
the
water
swain
explains
it
was
in
my
mouth


the
water
had
many
flavors
he
said
they
included
mud
poop
chemicals
and
gasoline



we
deserve
a
<collocation>gowanus canal</collocation>
that
sparkles
like
a
jewel
swain
says
