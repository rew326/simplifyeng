c
people
get
rid
of
tons
of
old
<collocation>electronic devices</collocation>
each
year
some
are
thrown
out
others
are
recycled
many
are
things
like
<collocation>old televisions</collocation>
there
are
old
cellphones
too


states
have
been
trying
to
get
the
makers
of
the
electronics
to
pay
for
recycling
half
of
the
states
still
do
not
have
recycling
programs
states
that
do
might
have
to
change
the
programs
one
reason
is
that
electronics
are
getting
smaller


many
<collocation>electronic devices</collocation>
should
not
be
thrown
away
with
<collocation>regular garbage</collocation>
they
have
dangerous
materials
inside
the
materials
can
poison
the
water
they
are
bad
for
the
soil
plus
the
metal
plastic
and
glass
in
the
devices
can
be
recycled



many
recycling
rules
and
laws

recycling
electronics
is
called
e
cycling
california
passed
the
first
state
law
requiring
e
cycling
the
law
passed
in
people
there
pay
extra
money
when
they
buy
electronics
the
money
pays
for
e
cycling
another
states
tell
the
companies
that
make
the
electronics
to
pay
for
e
cycling
programs
in
some
states
how
much
they
pay
is
based
on
how
much
they
sell


there
are
lots
of
different
laws
and
rules
this
makes
it
hard
for
manufacturers
to
follow
the
rules
said
walter
alcorn
he
works
at
the
consumer
<collocation>electronics association</collocation>
cea
the
group
is
made
up
of
electronics
companies


there
is
also
a
problem
with
some
state
laws
said
resa
domina
she
works
for
a
group
it
looks
at
how
electronics
affect
the
earth
some
laws
make
<collocation>manufacturers pay</collocation>
for
a
certain
weight
of
e
cycling
each
year
that
can
be
a
problem
she
said
manufacturers
can
stop
paying
once
they
have
met
their
goal
then
cities
or
states
have
to
pay
instead
if
they
do
not
recycling
stops


dimino
said
that
rules
could
be
changed
manufacturers
could
be
told
to
keep
paying
for
recycling



electronics
keep
changing

<collocation>electronic devices</collocation>
are
also
becoming
smaller
people
keep
them
longer
too
that
makes
it
harder
for
companies
to
collect
enough
recycled
materials
said
allison
schumacher
at
the
cea


televisions
have
also
changed
so
have
<collocation>computer screens</collocation>
they
used
to
be
made
with
big
tubes
the
tubes
had
glass
that
had
lead
in
it
now
most
tvs
and
screens
do
not
have
the
tubes
the
tubes
were
heavy
it
is
hard
to
meet
recycling
goals
based
on
weight
without
the
tubes
schumacher
said


<collocation>recycled electronics</collocation>
can
be
fixed
up
and
sold
again
if
not
they
are
taken
apart
then
the
pieces
are
sold
