beijing
china
is
building
islands
in
the
south
<collocation>china sea</collocation>
the
government
hopes
the
islands
will
help
the
country
<collocation>gain power</collocation>
however
building
islands
may
hurt
the
environment
people
are
especially
concerned
about
the
sea
<collocation>coral reefs</collocation>


the
south
<collocation>china sea</collocation>
is
located
between
china
vietnam
the
philippines
malaysia
and
brunei
the
sea
is
home
to
many
different
types
of
fish
and
<collocation>marine life</collocation>
the
reefs
are
very
shallow
fish
swim
around
the
<collocation>shallow areas</collocation>
and
live
in
the
coral
there
are
currently
many
reefs
in
the
south
<collocation>china sea</collocation>
without
the
reefs
many
fish
would
also
disappear


youna
lyons
and
wong
hiu
<collocation>fung work</collocation>
at
the
university
of
singapore
they
study
the
reefs
and
the
islands
in
the
south
<collocation>china sea</collocation>
they
believe
china
is
hurting
the
reefs
in
the
south
<collocation>china sea</collocation>



china
wants
to
own
it
all

the
process
of
making
<collocation>new islands</collocation>
is
called
dredging
<collocation>china digs</collocation>
up
sand
from
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
then
experts
believe
china
is
dumping
the
sand
on
top
of
the
reefs
if
this
is
true
the
<collocation>underwater life</collocation>
is
in
danger


china
has
already
created
<collocation>square miles</collocation>
of
man
made
land
for
many
countries
more
land
can
mean
more
power
this
might
help
explain
why
china
is
building
more
islands
the
nations
in
the
area
all
want
control
of
the
south
<collocation>china sea</collocation>
having
control
of
the
sea
can
protect
a
country
and
help
with
trade
one
challenge
is
that
all
the
countries
that
border
the
south
<collocation>china sea</collocation>
can
say
that
part
of
the
water
is
theirs
china
wants
to
own
the
entire
sea


ouyang
yujing
works
for
a
chinese
government
group
he
said
it
is
not
against
the
law
for
china
to
build
islands
using
dredging



<collocation>new islands</collocation>
serve
<collocation>many purposes</collocation>

china
uses
the
islands
for
many
different
things
the
islands
can
help
china
in
an
important
way
china
sends
its
people
to
work
on
the
islands


the
people
can
keep
others
safe
and
<collocation>rescue anyone</collocation>
in
danger
also
workers
can
do
<collocation>science experiments</collocation>
study
the
weather
and
watch
for
pirates
while
staying
on
the
islands
the
islands
help
china
protect
its
mainland
as
well


yujing
said
the
country
is
very
serious
about
the
dredging
and
is
careful
he
said
the
government
studied
the
environment
around
the
land
and
sea



humans
cause
a
lot
of
the
damage
to
reefs

still
the
reefs
are
in
danger
humans
are
responsible
for
a
lot
of
the
problem
chemicals
in
the
air
can
be
a
threat
to
reefs
and
coral
there
is
a
lot
of
carbon
dioxide
in
the
atmosphere
around
china
the
carbon
dioxide
is
killing
the
coral
china
also
blames
<collocation>fishing boats</collocation>
from
other
countries
nearby
for
causing
damage
to
the
reefs


haiwen
said
it
is
normal
for
countries
to
build
islands
in
this
way
she
said
china
is
following
all
of
the
international
rules
