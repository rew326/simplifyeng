many
people
here
in
seoul
<collocation>south korea</collocation>
are
wearing
facemasks
this
week
they
want
to
protect
themselves
from
a
terrible
disease
<collocation>middle east</collocation>
<collocation>respiratory syndrome</collocation>
mers


the
disease
first
showed
up
here
in
may
a
man
who
caught
mers
in
the
<collocation>middle east</collocation>
brought
it
with
him
when
he
returned
to
seoul
soon
the
disease
began
spreading
quickly



many
questions
about
mers

<collocation>south korea</collocation>
is
the
first
place
outside
the
<collocation>middle east</collocation>
to
have
a
<collocation>mers outbreak</collocation>


in
<collocation>south korea</collocation>
people
have
caught
mers
so
far
people
have
many
questions
about
the
disease
how
easy
is
it
to
catch
has
the
disease
changed
will
the
number
of
cases
in
seoul
go
up


<collocation>south korean</collocation>
scientists
kee
jong
hong
and
sung
han
kim
told
reporters
what
is
known
about
the
disease
there
is
no
cure
yet
they
said
some
people
who
catch
it
die


still
the
two
scientists
did
have
some
good
news


it
is
not
clear
how
<collocation>mers spreads</collocation>
the
scientists
said
however
many
diseases
change
over
time
or
mutate
once
they
mutate
diseases
sometimes
become
much
easier
to
catch
the
good
news
is
that
mers
has
not
mutated
yet
said
hong
still
the
disease
could
mutate
at
any
time
he
added



some
with
mers
don
t
get
sick

so
far
mers
has
mostly
spread
inside
hospitals
people
in
<collocation>south korea</collocation>
have
not
caught
it
on
the
street
or
from
their
family


the
disease
takes
some
time
to
spread
within
a
person
body
around
out
of
people
who
<collocation>catch mers</collocation>
never
become
sick
as
for
the
rest
they
only
begin
to
show
signs
of
illness
after
the
disease
has
spread
through
much
of
their
bodies
by
that
point
they
are
usually
very
sick
they
are
likely
to
end
up
going
to
a
hospital


experts
do
not
think
the
<collocation>disease spreads</collocation>
through
the
air
however
it
has
been
passed
from
one
<collocation>hospital patient</collocation>
to
another
this
has
happened
even
when
the
patients
were
more
than
feet
apart



are
hospital
tools
spreading
virus


doctors
think
they
have
an
explanation
they
believe
the
disease
is
spread
by
the
tools
used
to
<collocation>treat patients</collocation>
sometimes
such
tools
are
used
on
both
mers
patients
and
those
with
other
illnesses


kim
said
that
up
to
out
of
people
with
mers
have
died
however
most
already
had
another
illness
their
illness
may
have
made
their
<collocation>bodies unable</collocation>
to
fight
off
the
disease
fewer
than
in
hospital
workers
with
mers
have
died
usually
hospital
workers
who
<collocation>catch mers</collocation>
do
not
have
another
illness


if
the
disease
has
only
spread
in
hospitals
why
is
korea
<collocation>closing schools</collocation>
if
it
is
not
spread
through
the
air
why
should
people
wear
a
facemask


kim
said
both
things
are
wise
they
are
a
<collocation>good idea</collocation>
because
scientists
do
not
know
exactly
how
the
<collocation>disease spreads</collocation>



wear
a
facemask
<collocation>good idea</collocation>


keeping
yourself
from
catching
mers
is
not
the
only
reason
to
wear
a
facemask
kim
said
people
who
feel
sick
should
wear
a
facemask
too
even
if
it
just
feels
like
a
cold
it
is
the
safe
thing
to
do


<collocation>closing schools</collocation>
is
a
<collocation>good idea</collocation>
too
kim
said
the
disease
has
only
spread
in
hospitals
until
now
but
that
could
change
so
far
<collocation>south korean</collocation>
schools
have
been
closed


hong
thinks
things
will
start
to
get
better
over
the
next
week
or
two
the
number
of
new
cases
of
mers
in
<collocation>south korea</collocation>
will
probably
start
to
go
down
he
said
