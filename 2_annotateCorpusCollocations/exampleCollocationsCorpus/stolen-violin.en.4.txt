searching
<collocation>pawn shops</collocation>
where
people
sell
their
valuables

are

the
man
behind
the
lipinski

almond
is
recovering
from
the
attack
he
will
not
be
performing
this
weekend


almond
was
borrowing
the
instrument
from
its
owners
it
unknown
who
they
are
often
the
owners
of
famous
<collocation>instruments loan</collocation>
them
to
the
very
best
<collocation>performers such</collocation>
as
almond


the
violin
early
owners
included
the
talented
giuseppe
tartini
he
known
to
listeners
for
his
devil
trill
sonata
the
instrument
has
also
belonged
to
polish
violinist
<collocation>karol lipinski</collocation>
his
name
became
attached
to
the
violin


<collocation>music writer</collocation>
elaine
schmidt
got
to
hold
the
instrument
in
she
was
interviewing
almond
the
violin
seemed
to
be
far
lighter
than
one
would
expect
she
described
the
lipinski
as
a
<collocation>gorgeous example</collocation>
of
craftsmanship


during
that
interview
almond
explained
that
the
lipinski
is
affected
by
temperature
the
<collocation>violin sounds</collocation>
differently
some
days
than
others
<collocation>wet weather</collocation>
can
cause
it
to
play
differently



a
violin
that
makes
musicians
better


one
of
the
really
mysterious
things
about
these
instruments
is
that
they
really
maximize
our
strengths
almond
said
he
began
playing
the
lipinski
in
the
way
it
makes
sound
is
not
what
one
would
expect


it
like
a
fast
car
he
said
you
have
to
learn
to
drive
it


almond
was
told
the
violin
had
been
stored
in
a
<collocation>bank vault</collocation>
he
met
the
violin
owners
at
the
bank
and
they
asked
him
if
he
wanted
to
play
it
on
loan
he
said
yes


niehaus
said
that
because
the
violin
is
made
of
wood
it
needs
to
be
touched
it
needs
to
be
played


he
added
the
vibrations
of
the
music
keep
it
alive


in
british
police
recovered
a
stolen
year
old
stradivarius
that
violin
had
been
missing
for
more
than
two
years
