depending
on
how
you
feel
how
about
a
music
player
that

to
your
heartbeat
well
businesses
are
making
more
and
more

that
is
trying
to
come
up
with
new
<collocation>wearable tech</collocation>
it
working
on
a
product
like
google
upcoming
eyewear
<collocation>google glass</collocation>
can
log
onto
the
internet
it
is
also
designing
other
<collocation>wearable projects</collocation>
for
several
customers

william

hurley
said
<collocation>wearable technology</collocation>
will
be
big
business



it
just
like
when
the
iphone
came
out
and
there
was
this
<collocation>mad gold</collocation>
rush
it
gonna
be
the
same
thing
hurley
said



<collocation>google glass</collocation>
gives
a
push

mutual
mobile
is
working
on
<collocation>google glass</collocation>
programs
for
different
kinds
of
customers
doctors
might
use
the
glasses
to
get
patient
information
<collocation>warehouse workers</collocation>
could
use
them
to
scan
codes
on
packages



people
are
starting
to
get
into
it
said
sam
gaddis
a
company
officer


the
devices
depend
on
sensors
that
can
measure
all
kinds
of
information
gaddis
says
those
sensors
are
becoming
cheap
that
helps
more
people
develop
the
devices


mutual
mobile
developers
created
a
football
with
a
sensor
that
can
measure
the
quality
of
the
throw
they
also
made
a
<collocation>boxing game</collocation>
it
measures
how
often
you
ve
hit
the
target


experts
say
that
wearables
are
the
next
big
thing
in
tech



i
think
we
re
going
to
see
some
very
very
<collocation>big leaps</collocation>
in
just
the
next
year
businessman
manish
chandra
said
he
was
at
a
<collocation>wearable technology</collocation>
gathering
and
fashion
show
in
<collocation>san francisco</collocation>
hundreds
of
developers
engineers
and
designers
were
at
the
show



extending
human
abilities

google
glasses
are
making
the
<collocation>wearable technology</collocation>
field
more
popular
so
are
rumors
of
apple
iwatch
analysts
expect
fast
growth
last
year
almost
billion
in
<collocation>wearable technology</collocation>
was
sold
that
should
climb
to
billion
by
said
analyst
shane
walker
<collocation>wearable technology</collocation>
includes
everything
from
<collocation>hearing aids</collocation>
to
wristband
pedometers


hurley
says
google
<collocation>public relations</collocation>
campaign
for
its
glasses
helped
now
investors
are
putting
money
into
wearables


the
technology
will
also
be
used
in
video
games
take
the
oculus
rift
it
is
a
<collocation>virtual reality</collocation>
headset
for
d
gaming
<collocation>virtual reality</collocation>
technology
makes
you
feel
like
you
are
in
the
middle
of
a
made
up
world


robin
arnott
created
a
program
for
the
rift
he
showed
it
off
at
a
<collocation>recent meeting</collocation>
users
strap
on
the
headset
then
the
program
uses
the
sound
of
their
voice
to
display
a
series
of
tunneling
images


devices
like
google
glasses
place
the
internet
on
top
of
the
real
world
arnott
describes
them
as
<collocation>augmented reality</collocation>


wearables
extend
your
abilities
as
a
human
just
as
your
phone
does
he
said



not
everyone
will
adapt
to
it

humans
will
need
to
adapt
to
the
technology
said
georgia
institute
of
<collocation>technology professor</collocation>
thad
starner
he
advises
google
on
its
glasses


the
glasses
are
lightweight
frames
they
have
a
hidden
camera
and
a
<collocation>tiny display</collocation>
that
responds
to
<collocation>voice commands</collocation>
the
devices
will
cause
a
huge
change
said
starner
offering
capabilities
that
people
haven
t
thought
of
before


but
there
are
sure
to
be
issues
some
people
don
t
want
to
be
secretly
videoed
or
photographed
a
new
<collocation>survey shows</collocation>
that
some
people
don
t
like
the
idea
of
the
new
technology


forty
two
percent
of
workers
said
they
would
not
be
willing
to
strap
on
<collocation>wearable tech</collocation>
for
their
jobs
older
and
more
traditional
workers
were
less
willing
than
their
<collocation>younger counterparts</collocation>
the
survey
by
cornerstone
ondemand
polled
<collocation>americans aged</collocation>
and
over
in
august


then
there
an
issue
of
bandwidth
said
ritch
blasi
he
writes
about
the
<collocation>wearable technology</collocation>
market
right
now
there
simply
isn
t
enough
<collocation>network service</collocation>
to
<collocation>support constant</collocation>
<collocation>wireless use</collocation>
everywhere
he
said
but
that
too
will
catch
up



it
almost
makes
you
think
everyone
is
going
to
turn
into
a
cyborg
he
said
cyborg
is
a
fictional
high
<collocation>tech comic</collocation>
<collocation>book superhero</collocation>


will
they
when
you
look
at
the
world
and
everything
people
are
doing
blasi
said
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
yes
