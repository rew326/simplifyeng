are

<collocation>england patriots</collocation>
football
<collocation>biggest cheaters</collocation>


the
<collocation>super bowl</collocation>
is
this
sunday
it
is
the
most
important
football
game
of
the
year
this
year
the
patriots
are
playing
against
the
<collocation>seattle seahawks</collocation>


to
get
to
the
<collocation>super bowl</collocation>
the
<collocation>patriots beat</collocation>
the
indianapolis
colts
on
january
th
they
won
the
game
to
after
the
game
some
people
said
that
the
patriots
had
cheated



a
case
of
cheating


each
team
brings
its
own
footballs
to
games
the
teams
then
use
the
footballs
that
they
brought
for
example
when
it
was
the
patriots
turn
to
throw
and
catch
and
try
to
score
points
they
used
their
own
footballs


it
seems
that
the
balls
that
the
patriots
brought
did
not
have
the
right
amount
of
air
in
them
they
were
deflated
deflated
balls
are
easier
to
grab
and
throw
if
the
patriots
deflated
their
balls
on
purpose
it
would
be
cheating


people
have
nicknamed
the
question
deflategate
everyone
wants
to
know
how
those
balls
got
to
be
deflated
was
it
on
purpose


<collocation>patriots coach</collocation>
<collocation>bill belichick</collocation>
says
it
wasn
t
he
says
that
his
team
did
not
do
anything
wrong
he
spoke
to
reporters
on
<collocation>saturday afternoon</collocation>
we
feel
like
we
followed
the
rules
of
the
game
he
said
we
try
to
do
everything
right



belichick
blames
the
weather

at
first
belichick
said
that
he
had
no
idea
why
the
balls
were
deflated
on
saturday
however
he
had
a
guess
he
thought
it
might
be
because
of
the
weather


if
you
take
a
ball
from
a
<collocation>warm place</collocation>
to
a
cool
place
it
loses
some
of
the
air
inside
it
the
footballs
were
inflated
in
a
<collocation>warm room</collocation>
by
nfl
officials
then
they
were
used
in
the
game
which
was
on
a
cold
day


he
also
said
that
the
team
rubs
the
footballs
before
the
game
they
do
it
to
break
them
in
like
a
new
set
of
shoes
it
makes
them
easier
to
hold
onto
he
said
when
they
rubbed
them
it
could
have
made
the
footballs
warmer
then
when
they
were
taken
outside
the
footballs
got
colder
maybe
that
made
the
footballs
lose
some
air


he
does
not
know
for
sure
if
that
was
the
reason
i
m
not
a
scientist
i
m
not
an
expert
he
said
i
m
just
telling
you
what
i
know


not
everyone
believes
him
some
people
think
that
the
patriots
took
the
air
out
of
their
footballs
on
purpose



pointing
fingers
at
patriots

some
think
belichick
or
someone
else
with
the
patriots
deflated
the
balls
others
are
suspicious
of
<collocation>patriots quarterback</collocation>
<collocation>tom brady</collocation>
the
quarterback
is
the
player
who
throws
the
football
having
a
soft
football
is
most
helpful
to
the
quarterback
it
helps
the
quarterback
get
a
<collocation>good grip</collocation>
on
the
ball
and
throw
it
better


like
belichick
brady
has
said
he
did
not
cheat
he
said
that
he
didn
t
know
how
the
footballs
got
to
be
deflated



deflategate
has
gotten
a
lot
of
attention
some
people
are
talking
about
it
even
more
than
they
are
talking
about
sunday
<collocation>super bowl</collocation>
game


belichick
complained
that
trying
to
explain
what
happened
has
taken
up
a
lot
of
time
instead
of
preparing
for
the
<collocation>super bowl</collocation>
he
has
had
to
answer
questions
about
the
deflated
footballs


the
nfl
is
looking
into
the
matter
like
many
mysteries
this
one
may
not
be
solved
anytime
soon


either
way
the
patriots
will
play
in
the
<collocation>super bowl</collocation>
this
sunday
and
the
nfl
will
make
sure
that
all
of
the
footballs
are
properly
inflated
