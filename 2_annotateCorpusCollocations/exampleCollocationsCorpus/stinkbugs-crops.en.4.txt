rinehart
has
a
problem
in
his
orchard
stink
bugs
are
damaging
his
apples
and
peaches


rinehart
first
noticed
the
problem
five
years
ago
he
<collocation>saw brownish</collocation>
spots
on
his
apples
and
peaches
rinehart
thought
the
fruit
was
low
in
calcium
but
spraying
the
fruit
with
calcium
didn
t
help


university
of
maryland
scientists
cut
open
his
fruit
and
examined
it
then
it
became
clear
that
the
problem
was
stink
bugs
the
bugs
are
more
damaging
to
fruit
than
a
lack
of
calcium
they
are
also
more
unpredictable


rinehart
owns
<collocation>rinehart orchards</collocation>
in
maryland
he
said
stink
bugs
damage
between
one
tenth
and
one
fifth
of
his
crop
every
year



they
are
a
major
<collocation>major issue</collocation>
in
our
orchards
rinehart
said
it
nothing
that
you
can
take
lightly



surviving
the
winter


the
stink
bugs
do
not
belong
here
they
came
to
north
america
in
the
late
the
bugs
caused
bad
damage
in
and
some
<collocation>maryland growers</collocation>
are
still
dealing
with
damage
from
stink
bugs
the
problem
can
almost
ruin
the
worth
of
a
<collocation>fruit crop</collocation>
rinehart
said
but
others
have
seen
<collocation>damage ease</collocation>


stink
<collocation>bugs pierce</collocation>
fruit
with
their
mouths
and
<collocation>suck sugar</collocation>
out
the
damage
may
have
decreased
since
and
but
there
no
reason
to
believe
the
insect
is
going
away
said
gerry
brust
he
is
an
expert
in
pest
management



that
what
insect
populations
do
it
goes
up
down
he
said


even
<collocation>extreme weather</collocation>
won
t
get
rid
of
the
bugs
so
the
<collocation>record low</collocation>
temperatures
in
many
parts
of
the
nation
this
winter
are
not
solving
the
problem


stink
bugs
can
escape
the
cold
by
living
in
places
like
dead
or
rotting
trees
said
<collocation>donald weber</collocation>
he
studies
bugs
for
the
u
department
of
agriculture
usda



they
re
perfectly
capable
of
surviving
the
winter
weber
said



<collocation>scientists test</collocation>
samples

rinehart
said
he
has
to
look
hard
for
stink
<collocation>bug damage</collocation>
he
can
spray
something
to
keep
the
bugs
away
the
spray
is
safe
for
the
fruit
but
it
also
keeps
away
insects
that
help
the
fruit


guy
moore
is
<collocation>vice president</collocation>
at
<collocation>larriland farm</collocation>
he
said
that
stink
bugs
caused
a
lot
of
damage
in
and
but
they
did
not
<collocation>cause significant</collocation>
damage
after
that


usda
scientists
take
samples
of
apples
and
peaches
from
his
farm
they
have
been
able
to
help
watch
over
the
stink
<collocation>bug population</collocation>
<collocation>moore hopes</collocation>
the
stink
bugs
will
only
be
a
small
problem
in
the
future


stink
bugs
have
been
in
north
america
for
a
short
period
of
time
scientists
haven
t
had
time
to
find
out
how
their
population
changes
weber
said



we
ve
only
had
a
few
years
there
a
lot
of
other
things
that
can
happen
he
said
we
had
a
big
<collocation>cold snap</collocation>
this
year
maybe
that
does
nothing
to
them
we
just
don
t
know
the
<collocation>safe bet</collocation>
is
they
re
not
going
away



bringing
in
predators

some
animals
in
the
area
are
slowly
starting
to
recognize
stink
bugs
as
food
weber
said
scientists
are
thinking
about
bringing
in
<collocation>natural enemies</collocation>
to
feed
on
the
stink
bugs


but
that
could
take
a
long
time
introducing
a
stink
<collocation>bug enemy</collocation>
could
take
three
to
five
years
scientists
from
the
u
canada
and
mexico
would
have
to
agree
to
let
it
happen
weber
said


tiny
wasps
could
be
the
chosen
enemy
weber
said
the
wasps
lay
their
eggs
on
other
insects
eggs
then
the
newly
hatched
wasps
eat
the
eggs
of
their
prey
including
stink
bugs


chemists
have
also
made
a
copy
of
the
stink
bug
pheromones
or
scent
weber
said
growers
could
use
the
fake
scent
it
would
draw
the
insects
away
from
their
fruit


but
for
now
growers
will
have
to
continue
to
use
short
term
measures
like
pesticides
doing
this
can
limit
the
damage



in
this
business
you
are
at
the
mercy
of
nature
stink
bugs
are
something
that
have
definitely
added
to
that
and
added
in
a
very
strong
way
rinehart
said
yeah
stink
bugs
are
a
bummer
man
