kids

t
keep
up
with
their
parents
why
because

aren
t
getting
enough
exercise


grant
tomkinson
job
is
to
<collocation>study fitness</collocation>


for
years
children
around
the
world
have
been
timed
on
how
fast
they
can
run
they
were
also
measured
on
how
far
they
could
go
tomkinson
gathered
all
those
running
times
and
he
and
his
team
compared
them


the
results
were
not
pretty
kids
today
are
slower
and
weaker
than
kids
years
ago



kids
are
less
active


tomkinson
said
that
for
both
boys
and
girls
of
all
ages
fitness
levels
have
dropped



it
makes
sense
we
have
kids
that
are
less
active
than
before

children
and
older
should
get
at
least
one
hour
of
exercise
per
day
right
now
only
one
third
of
american
kids
are
getting
that
much
exercise


there
are
many
reasons
why
kids
today
are
less
fit
tomkinson
and
daniels
said
that
weight
might
be
the
problem
many
children
in
the
united
states
are
at
an
unhealthy
weight

obesity
being
very
overweight
makes
it
harder
to
run
or
do
any
heart
pumping
exercise


television
and
video
games
may
be
a
problem
too
many
kids
may
be
spending
time
in
front
of
screens
instead
of
playing
they
said
also
some
kids
live
in
<collocation>unsafe neighborhoods</collocation>
they
cannot
go
outdoors
to
play
they
added



heavier
and
slower

there
no
more
<collocation>gym class</collocation>

daniels
said
for
some
kids
recess
is
the
only
chance
they
get
to
exercise
during
school

history
he
said


american
