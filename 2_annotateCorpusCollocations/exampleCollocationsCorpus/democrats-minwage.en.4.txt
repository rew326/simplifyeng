night
debates
allow
candidates
to
say
why
they
are
the

person
for

job
that
also
means
saying
why
the
others
are
not
the
right
person


tuesday
debate
was
shown
on
tv
millions
of

watched
it


the

martin
o
malley

hillary
<collocation>rodham clinton</collocation>
right
now

is
in
the
lead



<collocation>candidates want</collocation>
pay
rate
to
be


on
tuesday
the
candidates
talked
about
many
things
they
each
have
different
ideas
about
how
to
make
the
country
better


they
skipped
over
one
important
thing
though
they
did
not
talk
about
the
<collocation>minimum wage</collocation>


the
<collocation>minimum wage</collocation>
sets
what
people
are
paid
for
working
bosses
must
pay
workers
the
<collocation>minimum wage</collocation>
<collocation>anything less</collocation>
is
against
the
law


right
now
the
<collocation>minimum wage</collocation>
is
an
hour
the
law
covers
the
whole
country


sanders
o
malley
and
clinton
all
want
to
raise
the
<collocation>minimum wage</collocation>
they
have
different
ideas
about
how
much
it
should
be
raised
though


sanders
and
o
malley
want
to
raise
it
to
an
hour



clinton
keeping
quiet
about
her
thoughts
on
pay

clinton
also
thinks
the
<collocation>minimum wage</collocation>
should
be
higher
she
has
not
said
how
much
it
should
be
raised
though
she
probably
wants
it
to
be
less
than
an
hour


clinton
might
have
good
reasons
for
not
saying


if
the
<collocation>minimum wage</collocation>
is
too
high
there
might
be
problems
bosses
might
find
it
hard
to
pay
their
workers
they
might
stop
giving
new
people
jobs
many
people
would
have
a
harder
time
finding
work


some
people
say
an
hour
is
worth
a
try
though
it
could
make
life
easier
for
many
people
