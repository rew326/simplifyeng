denver
on
<collocation>wednesday afternoon</collocation>
near
denver
about
students
gathered
in
the
streets
they
came
from
several
high
schools
new
teaching
rules
may
soon
shape
what
they
learn
in
their
history
classes
students
were
there
to
stop
that
from
happening


a
new
plan
was
proposed
to
change
<collocation>history standards</collocation>
the
new
standards
would
try
to
make
students
more
patriotic
and
love
their
country
they
would
be
taught
more
<collocation>positive lessons</collocation>
about
america
history
<collocation>fewer lessons</collocation>
would
teach
information
that
makes
the
united
states
look
bad


most
of
the
<collocation>young protesters</collocation>
gathered
at
a
<collocation>busy street</collocation>
corner
they
waved
signs
and
american
flags
the
demonstration
lasted
about
three
hours


later
about
another
students
walked
out
of
<collocation>alameda international</collocation>
<collocation>high school</collocation>
they
had
met
with
school
superintendent
dan
mcminimee
students
were
not
happy
with
what
he
had
to
say
about
the
new
plan



picking
and
choosing
parts
of
history

the
plan
was
suggested
by
school
<collocation>board member</collocation>
<collocation>julie williams</collocation>
she
is
a
conservative
meaning
that
she
<collocation>supports traditional</collocation>
ideas
many
conservatives
think
some
schoolbooks
say
too
many
bad
things
about
america
they
believe
that
reading
<collocation>such material</collocation>
will
change
students
thinking
students
they
fear
will
become
rebellious
they
will
no
longer
feel
proud
of
their
country


williams
plan
was
created
because
of
a
change
in
how
history
is
taught
in
schools
across
the
country
the
change
is
to
look
at
both
the
bad
in
<collocation>american history</collocation>
along
with
the
good
williams
and
other
conservatives
do
not
agree
with
that


supporters
of
the
new
approach
to
history
say
it
gives
a
more
<collocation>balanced view</collocation>
they
say
both
sides
of
the
story
should
be
heard
they
think
that
honesty
about
our
country
problems
in
history
and
mistakes
is
a
good
thing


many
conservatives
think
the
new
history
lessons
will
focus
too
much
on
problems
students
might
start
hating
america
and
its
leaders
they
say
williams
and
others
want
all
<collocation>history readings</collocation>
to
be
reviewed
they
only
want
to
allow
those
that
make
students
proud
of
the
united
states



student
demonstrations
go
on

so
far
schools
have
not
tried
to
stop
<collocation>student demonstrators</collocation>


at
wednesday

students
gathered
peacefully
most
came
from
two
high
schools
chatfield
and
<collocation>dakota ridge</collocation>


some
kids
were
just
skipping
class
<collocation>student organizer</collocation>
<collocation>scott romano</collocation>
admitted
however
he
said
most
were
there
for
the
right
reasons


<collocation>teacher protests</collocation>
began
on
friday
then
students
joined
in
teachers
staged
a
so
called
sick
out
they
called
in
sick
at
the
same
time
causing
two
schools
to
shut
down


students
began
walking
out
of
classes
on
monday
hundreds
have
done
so
by
now


not
everyone
thinks
the
students

what
they
are
doing
superintendent
mcminimee
said
he
worries
that
students
were
not
fully
informed


students
he
said
don
t
necessarily
have
the
<collocation>whole picture</collocation>
