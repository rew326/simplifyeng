nineteen
year
old
celestelle
webster
and
year
old
<collocation>christelle roach</collocation>
pour
out
their
feelings
they
are
both
fierce
and
startling
as
they
recite
poetry



the
bones
in
my
body
are
like
needles
in
my
skin
i
am
a
bomb
take
shelter


the
two
are
in
a
<collocation>small auditorium</collocation>
facing
each
other
onstage
they
speak
the
words
that
they
wrote
together


webster
and
roach
are
members
of
something
called
wordspeak
based
in
miami
wordspeak
is
a
spoken
word
poetry
program
designed
for
teens


what
happening
today
is
just
a
<collocation>practice run</collocation>
in
july
wordspeak
will
send
webster
roach
and
five
others
to
a
national
<collocation>poetry contest</collocation>


wordspeak
teaches
young
people
the
craft
of
poetry
at
the
same
time
it
aims
to
give
them
confidence
and
a
sense
of
purpose



coaching
the
team
to
the
top

coach
<collocation>teo castellanos</collocation>
is
key
to
that
goal


castellanos
is
an
award
winning
writer
and
teacher
his
life
didn
t
start
out
promisingly
he
grew
up
around
drugs
and
gangs
this
kind
of
past
helps
him
reach
kids
with
the
same
kind
of
<collocation>tough background</collocation>
<collocation>castellanos shifts</collocation>
easily
between
<collocation>street slang</collocation>
and
<collocation>careful teaching</collocation>


the
poetry
team
will
need
to
be
at
the
top
of
its
game
later
this
month
it
will
be
heading
to
the
<collocation>brave new</collocation>
<collocation>voices contest</collocation>
in
philadelphia
there
the
members
will
face
off
against
other
teens
the
other
kids
will
be
coming
from
across
the
united
states
and
from
other
countries


at
the
<collocation>practice run</collocation>
<collocation>castellanos offers</collocation>
encouragement
to
roach
and
webster
he
urges
them
not
to
forget
your
goals
your
rhythms


next
up
are
wesly
oviedo
steffon
dixon
and
al
alexandre
their
poem
is
about
<collocation>gun deaths</collocation>
the
boys
are
african
american
and
they
take
the
subject
personally
saying
with
anger
i
feel
like
florida
is
the
<collocation>gunshine state</collocation>
and
i
m
living
in
the
bottom
of
the
barrel


castellanos
is
pleased
but
pushes
for
improvement
he
suggests
they
start
with
a
feeling
of
celebration
if
they
begin
that
way
it
will
make
the
shift
to
<collocation>gun deaths</collocation>
more
shocking



it
gonna
be
crazy
he
says



everybody
here
loves
poetry


the
seven
members
of
the
team
were
selected
from
a
group
of
around
wordspeak
members
each
had
won
<collocation>smaller poetry</collocation>
contests
these
are
held
to
help
choose
the
team
for
the
<collocation>national contest</collocation>


the
goal
of
wordspeak
is
not
just
to
sharpen
writing
and
speaking
skills
the
program
also
aims
to
give
teens
more
confidence


maylin
enamorado
started
performing
her
poetry
when
she
was
in
<collocation>ninth grade</collocation>
at
first
she
was
afraid
of
getting
onstage
when
she
was
chosen
for
the
wordspeak
team
the
following
year
she
was
shocked


once
she
arrived
at
that
earlier
contest
though
she
quickly
became
excited
it
was
great
to
be
around
hundreds
of
other
kids
who
love
poetry



for
the
first
time
i
was
like
poetry
is
normal
enamorado
says
i
felt
completely
at
home
and
the
creativity
the
subjects
were
eye
opening


it
can
be
a
big
help
for
these
teens
to
find
others
who
think
like
them
roach
says
she
the
only
artist
in
a
family
focused
on
sports
and
business
she
is
she
says
the
pen
in
the
box
of
pencils
growing
up
she
wrote
poetry
at
her
brother
<collocation>basketball games</collocation>


this
is
roach
second
year
with
the
wordspeak
team



everyone
has
<collocation>such vast</collocation>
knowledge
i
feel
like
i
have
so
many
books
open
to
me
says
roach
i
ve
changed
in
that
i
know
how
to
say
what
i
m
feeling
