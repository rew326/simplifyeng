americans
don
t
drink
as
much
milk
as
they
used
to
every
year
they
drink
less
and
less
milk
the
people
who
make
and
sell
milk
have
decided
it
is
time
to
fight
back
they
are
hoping
to
make
milk
a
popular
drink
once
again


there
are
several
ideas
about
what
might
help
one
idea
is
to
put
milk
in
a
new
kind
of
container
unlike
<collocation>regular containers</collocation>
the
new
type
will
not
need
to
be
refrigerated
until
it
is
opened


in
u
milk
sales
were
very
low
the
last
time
people
were
buying
so
little
milk
was
in



three
reasons
why

experts
say
there
are
three
reasons
why
milk
is
not
selling
very
well


they
say
one
reason
is
that
people
shopping
and
eating
habits
have
changed


another
reason
is
that
there
are
so
many
new
<collocation>drink choices</collocation>
there
are
now
all
sorts
of
new
sodas
and
juices
there
are
also
new
sports
drinks


a
third
reason
is
that
milk
has
not
changed
some
say
new
kinds
of
milk
drinks
should
be
offered


americans
still
buy
as
many
gallons
of
drinks
a
year
as
they
used
to
they
are
just
not
drinking
as
much
milk
these
days

<collocation>tom gallagher</collocation>
runs
a
group
called
dairy
management
his
group
works
hard
to
get
people
to
buy
more
milk
people
may
never
drink
as
much
milk
as
they
did
in
the
past
he
said


gallagher
says
in
the
future
the
average
person
may
not
even
think
about
ordering
milk
to
drink


his
group
is
working
with
seven
other
partners
to
make
milk
more
popular
<collocation>dairy farmers</collocation>
of
america
is
one
of
the
partners
it
represents
thousands
of
<collocation>farmers nationwide</collocation>


monica
massey
is
a
<collocation>vice president</collocation>
at
<collocation>dairy farmers</collocation>
of
america
she
thinks
new
kinds
of
milk
drinks
need
to
be
created
she
said
flavored
milk
might
help
she
also
likes
the
idea
of
making
milk
based
sports
drinks



let
try
this
again

massey
said
<collocation>milk companies</collocation>
have
to
understand
what
people
look
for
when
they
choose
a
drink
for
example
they
may
want
something
sweet
they
may
want
a
small
easy
to
carry
container



we
can
t
just
put
a
gallon
of
milk
on
a
shelf
and
hope
<collocation>someone buys</collocation>
it
she
said


<collocation>milk companies</collocation>
are
trying
to
get
children
to
drink
more
milk
they
are
guessing
that
<collocation>funny containers</collocation>
might
help
one
new
container
is
shaped
like
a
cow
head


companies
are
also
offering
a
new
kind
of
packaging
it
allows
milk
to
be
kept
unrefrigerated
businesses
save
money
if
they
can
keep
milk
without
a
refrigerator


this
is
not
the
first
time
these
groups
have
tried
to
get
people
to
drink
more
milk
they
have
tried
in
the
past
but
failed


another
problem
is
that
people
are
eating
fewer
foods
that
use
milk
people
are
eating
less
<collocation>cold cereal</collocation>
so
they
do
not
need
as
much
milk


some
companies
are
trying
to
help
quaker
oats
sells
oatmeal
its
recipe
used
to
say
to
mix
the
oats
with
water
now
it
says
to
use
milk
instead


a
new
way
of
making
oatmeal
doesn
t
sound
like
much
however
it
could
lead
to
a
lot
more
milk
being
sold
