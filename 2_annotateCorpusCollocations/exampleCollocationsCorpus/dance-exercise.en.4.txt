scientists
have
bad
news
for
young
dancers
they
might
be
working
hard
but
fewer
than
in
kids
are
getting
enough
exercise
in
their
<collocation>dance classes</collocation>
for
teens
who
dance
the
numbers
are
even
worse


the
scientists
studying
the
dancers
are
from
<collocation>san diego</collocation>
state
university
and
the
university
of
california
in
<collocation>san diego</collocation>
more
than
young
dancers
helped
with
their
project


each
girl
wore
a
<collocation>special belt</collocation>
while
she
was
dancing
the
girls
took
seven
different
kinds
of
<collocation>dance classes</collocation>
the
belts
kept
track
of
how
long
the
girls
spent
dancing
they
could
also
tell
how
quickly
the
girls
were
moving



<collocation>dance classes</collocation>
miss
daily
exercise
goal

to
stay
healthy
students
need
minutes
of
exercise
during
school
doctors
say
students
should
get
another
minutes
of
exercise
after
school


the
scientists
said
the
<collocation>dance classes</collocation>
they
studied
could
not
meet
that
goal
every
class
lasted
almost
an
hour
but
students
did
not
dance
the
whole
time
none
of
the
classes
kept
dancers
moving
long
enough


some
<collocation>dance classes</collocation>
were
better
than
others
<collocation>high energy</collocation>
classes
like
hip
hop
scored
the
highest
dancers
did
minutes
of
<collocation>hard work</collocation>
in
those
classes


<collocation>spanish dancing</collocation>
is
pretty
slow
those
classes
only
gave
students
six
minutes
of
good
exercise



<collocation>teen dancers</collocation>
move
less
than
kids

scientists
looked
at
two
age
groups
for
this
study
they
found
one
<collocation>big surprise</collocation>
most
<collocation>teenage dancers</collocation>
get
less
exercise
than
<collocation>younger dancers</collocation>


at
first
that
did
not
make
sense
to
the
scientists
older
students
usually
go
to
longer
harder
classes
that
gives
them
more
chances
to
get
exercise


the
scientists
tried
to
find
a
reason
why
teens
were
dancing
less
than
kids
they
were
taking
the
same
classes
but
the
teens
had
<collocation>harder dances</collocation>
maybe
they
had
to
stand
around
while
they
learned
the
moves


scientists
also
thought
the
younger
students
might
just
be
moving
more
maybe
they
were
not
standing
still
in
line



soccer
is
better
for
working
up
a
sweat

when
the
study
was
finished
the
scientists
talked
about
what
they
had
learned
they
decided
that
team
sports
are
better
exercise
than
<collocation>dance classes</collocation>


for
example
<collocation>dancers wind</collocation>
up
standing
around
for
about
a
third
of
each
class
<collocation>soccer players</collocation>
stand
still
just
as
much
when
they
start
moving
<collocation>soccer players</collocation>
go
faster
and
harder
than
dancers
<collocation>soccer players</collocation>
have
to
work
up
a
sweat
and
give
it
their
all


doctors
say
that
type
of
exercise
keeps
kids
from
becoming
overweight
dancers
hardly
ever
have
to
move
that
way


dance
can
be
difficult
but
it
is
challenging
in
a
different
way
it
is
fun
to
do
and
fun
to
watch
it
just
does
not
help
kids
stay
as
healthy
as
sports
can
