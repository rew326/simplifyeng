anchorage
alaska
at
the
<collocation>anchorage museum</collocation>
the
starfish
cling
to
the
rocks
in
the
tank
the
five
armed
creatures
wait
to
be
lifted
out
for
petting


these
<collocation>slow animals</collocation>
don
t
seem
ready
for
quick
surprises
but
last
fall
these
starfish
got
a
disease
this
illness
is
now
killing
them
up
and
down
the
<collocation>west coast</collocation>


the
disease
is
called
<collocation>sea star</collocation>
wasting
syndrome
it
is
shown
by
a
strange
twisting
of
the
starfish
arms
the
animal
gets
<collocation>white marks</collocation>
on
its
skin
the
animal
dies
quickly
after
its
arms
fall
off
and
its
body
softens
the
disease
has
killed
huge
numbers
of
<collocation>sea stars</collocation>


scientists
are
worried
by
the
number
of
deaths
they
haven
t
yet
found
a
cause
for
the
illness



a
huge
outbreak

tens
of
millions
of
starfish
live
on
the
<collocation>west coast</collocation>
scientists
don
t
know
how
many
have
died
from
this
disease
<collocation>pete raimondi</collocation>
is
a
professor
at
the
university
of
california
<collocation>santa cruz</collocation>
he
said
between
tens
of
thousands
and
millions
of
<collocation>sea stars</collocation>
could
have
died


big
die
offs
have
happened
before
but
none
have
been
as
large
as
this
one
the
syndrome
has
been
seen
as
far
south
as
<collocation>san diego</collocation>
which
is
nearly
miles
from
anchorage


in
alaska
the
disease
was
first
found
last
summer
on
<collocation>kayak island</collocation>
raimondi
was
working
with
a
group
surveying
the
sea
life
on
the
coast


they
discovered
a
number
of
<collocation>diseased sea</collocation>
stars
on
the
cold
island
scientists
had
thought
that
the
disease
happened
in
warmer
water
it
was
the
last
place
on
earth
where
we
would
have
expected
to
see
it
<collocation>professor raimondi</collocation>
explained


scientists
took
pictures
of
the
animals
and
left
the
island
then
the
starfish
illness
started
showing
up
all
over
the
<collocation>west coast</collocation>



suffering
starfish
killed

the
scientists
went
to
whittier
alaska
on
aug
there
they
found
one
<collocation>sea star</collocation>
twisted
and
looking
deflated
that
<collocation>sea star</collocation>
was
so
ill
that
the
scientists
had
to
kill
the
animal
to
stop
its
suffering


the
museum
killed
a
total
of
eight
suffering
starfish
between
august
and
november
one
<collocation>sea star</collocation>
lost
two
arms
in
a
single
day
the
scientists
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
but
since
november
the
disease
seems
to
have
vanished
again


greg
<collocation>danner works</collocation>
at
the
museum
of
anchorage
he
said
that
it
may
have
helped
the
starfish
when
the
museum
cooled
the
water
in
the
tanks
but
it
is
hard
to
tell
we
re
in
the
same
mystery
boat
as
the
rest
of
the
world
he
said


raimondi
said
the
disease
is
more
common
in
starfishes
kept
in
museums
this
could
be
a
sign
that
the
animals
get
ill
more
quickly
outside
the
ocean


but
<collocation>professor raimondi</collocation>
explained
that
the
<collocation>sea stars</collocation>
are
still
getting
the
disease
in
the
wild
these
are
not
<collocation>unlucky animals</collocation>
that
have
been
washed
up
on
a
beach
they
are
starfish
in
their
<collocation>usual homes</collocation>



the
real
question


the
scientists
say
that
the
starfish
are
affected
differently
depending
on
where
they
live
<collocation>sea stars</collocation>
that
live
in
<collocation>tide pools</collocation>
next
to
the
beach
get
<collocation>white marks</collocation>
on
their
skin
first
they
can
be
ill
for
many
weeks
before
they
die
and
sometimes
they
don
t
die
at
all


but
the
disease
acts
quicker
for
<collocation>underwater starfish</collocation>
it
is
also
much
more
deadly
these
<collocation>sea stars</collocation>
can
lose
their
arms
in
hours
rather
than
weeks


raimondi
said
scientists
are
now
close
to
finding
the
cause
of
the
disease
he
thinks
the
illness
is
caused
by
an
infection


there
does
not
seem
to
be
a
link
between
the
disease
and
a
disaster
in
japan
in
a
<collocation>power plant</collocation>
exploded
there
and
leaked
radiation
into
the
ocean
some
experts
believed
this
could
have
caused
the
starfish
disease


but
if
a
cause
of
the
disease
is
found
another
problem
for
the
<collocation>future remains</collocation>
how
do
we
stop
it
is
it
the
type
of
thing
that
will
heal
itself
over
time
that
the
real
question
raimondi
said
