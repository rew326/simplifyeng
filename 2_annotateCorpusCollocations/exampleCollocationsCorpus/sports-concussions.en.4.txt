a
new
study
has
looked
at
how
hits
to
the
head
affect
college
athletes
athletes
may
get
through
the
season
without
a
concussion
but
they
could
still
show
bad
changes
in
their
brains
the
study
shows
a
concussion
is
a
bad
type
of
<collocation>brain injury</collocation>
it
is
caused
by
a
hard
hit
to
the
head


football
and
<collocation>ice hockey</collocation>
players
may
have
shown
no
<collocation>visible signs</collocation>
of
<collocation>brain injuries</collocation>
but
they
still
showed
changes
in
how
the
brain
looked
the
changes
are
a
reason
to
worry
the
athletes
also
did
worse
on
brain
tests
following
the
season
athletes
in
other
sports
did
not
have
those
changes


a
season
of
small
hits
may
cause
the
brain
to
change
other
studies
have
found
almost
the
same
thing
those
brain
changes
cause
problems
with
memory
mood
or
the
ability
to
learn
years
later
none
of
the
<collocation>single hits</collocation>
are
hard
enough
to
send
someone
to
a
doctor
but
the
brain
can
change
from
all
the
hits
anyway


players
may
heal
after
the
sports
season
is
over
scientists
are
still
trying
to
figure
out
how
easily
the
brain
recovers
from
injury
they
also
want
to
know
if
there
is
a
point
when
the
damage
cannot
be
reversed



hits
add
up
to
damage

the
new
results
don
t
answer
the
questions
but
they
do
suggest
one
thing
repeated
blows
to
the
head
can
cause
damage
this
even
could
be
true
when
an
athlete
is
able
to
get
up
and
keep
playing

mcallister
said
but
it
may
not
be
enough
he
added


the
study
looked
at
students
at
<collocation>dartmouth college</collocation>
the
students
played
on
top
teams
they
played
between
and


the
athletes
who
played
<collocation>contact sports</collocation>
wore
devices
in
their
helmets
football
and
hockey
are
<collocation>contact sports</collocation>


the
devices
measured
the
number
of
blows
to
the
head
they
also
measured
how
hard
the
hits
were
the
athletes
also
got
<collocation>mri brain</collocation>
scans
an
mri
takes
detailed
pictures
of
the
body
the
athletes
ability
to
learn
and
memorize
things
was
also
tested
the
mris
and
tests
were
done
before
the
season
then
they
were
done
again
after
the
season


the
researchers
only
looked
at
certain
athletes
they
were
athletes
who
didn
t
have
<collocation>brain injuries</collocation>
during
the
season
scientists
said
there
were
links
between
blows
to
the
head
and
changes
in
parts
of
the
brain
they
also
found
changes
in
the
athletes
ability
to
learn
and
memorize
things
the
changes
were
there
weeks
after
the
season
ended



<collocation>higher risk</collocation>
of
concussions


the
scans
showed
football
and
<collocation>hockey players</collocation>
had
changes
in
their
brains
the
changes
were
worse
than
anything
seen
in
the
brains
of
the
athletes
who
played
<collocation>noncontact sports</collocation>
the
changes
happened
after
only
one
season
the
players
who
had
the
biggest
changes
in
their
brain
also
showed
something
else
they
did
the
worst
on
learning
and
memory
tests
after
the
season
was
over


mcallister
said
there
was
good
news
the
brains
of
contact
sport
athletes
at
the
start
of
their
seasons
were
about
the
same
as
that
of
athletes
in
<collocation>noncontact sports</collocation>
this
happened
even
though
they
had
played
their
sports
for
years
so
brains
of
college
athletes
may
get
better


but
there
could
be
athletes
who
don
t
heal
as
well
there
could
also
be
athletes
who
have
<collocation>larger problems</collocation>
from
small
changes
in
the
brain
those
effects
could
also
not
show
up
until
later


scientists
want
to
find
a
line
for
when
hits
that
were
safe
and
hits
that
caused
concussions
but
they
have
not
been
able
to
yet



and
players
may
be
at
<collocation>higher risk</collocation>
for
a
concussion
after
taking
several
<collocation>smaller hits</collocation>



we
know
some
of
them
heal
but
some
of
them
don
