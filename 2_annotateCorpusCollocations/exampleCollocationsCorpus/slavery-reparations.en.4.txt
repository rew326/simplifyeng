united
nations
caribbean
countries
were
<collocation>european colonies</collocation>
or
more
years
ago
during
the
height
of
the
<collocation>african slave</collocation>
trade
now
they
want
money
from
european
countries
to
make
up
for
the
problems
caused
by
slavery


those
payments
are
called
reparations
they
are
meant
to
repair
the
damage
that
the
caribbean
countries
say
continues
today


almost
every
caribbean
leader
who
spoke
at
the
united
<collocation>nation last</collocation>
week
brought
up
the
issue


the
fight
is
many
years
old
<collocation>black scholars</collocation>
and
others
across
the
united
states
caribbean
and
africa
have
unsuccessfully
sought
money
from
britain
france
and
the
netherlands
but
they
were
never
supported
by
most
citizens
or
<collocation>political leaders</collocation>
now
that
has
changed



reparations
to
fight
poverty

the
push
for
reparations
has
been
gaining
steam
in
<collocation>recent weeks</collocation>
leaders
of
the
member
<collocation>caribbean community</collocation>
group
agreed
to
ask
the
<collocation>former colonial</collocation>
powers
to
pay
up
they
have
met
with
a
british
<collocation>law firm</collocation>
and
called
for
apologies
they
might
even
go
to
the
<collocation>international court</collocation>
of
justice
if
the
europeans
will
not
deal
with
them
the
court
is
the
united

<collocation>main legal</collocation>
arm


the
leaders
say
what
they
want
most
is
money
for
programs
to
help
lift
people
out
of
poverty
the
money
could
be
used
for
things
like
building
schools
and
making
bridges
and
roads

is
prime
minister
of
st

the

he
is
one
of
the
leaders



it
a
<collocation>historic wrong</collocation>
that
has
to
be
righted
gonsalves
said
he
noted
that
other
groups
have
received
payments
for
historic
wrongs
especially
during

ii



it
not
a
confrontation
it
a
conversation
that
the
<collocation>caribbean nations</collocation>
are
seeking
for
the
year
old
problem
gonsalves
said
it
not
a
protest
it
an
engagement



<collocation>european leaders</collocation>
resist
reparations

it
is
not
clear
if
other
nations
will
join
the
caribbean
call
on
monday
the
u

the
winning
design
of
a
memorial
to
honor
the
victims
of
slavery
the
memorial
will
be
built
at
u
n
headquarters


gonsalves
and
other
leaders
say
they
welcome
the
memorial
and
the
u
n
efforts
but
more
action
is
needed
he
said


leaders

african
countries
like
<collocation>south africa</collocation>
ghana
and
ethiopia
are
on
board
gonsalves
said

re
going
to
build
the
links
we
have
to
build
it
inside
of
europe
too
with
<collocation>ordinary europeans</collocation>


but
<collocation>european governments</collocation>
might
not
listen


french
president
fran
ois
hollande
resists
demands
from
haiti
to
<collocation>pay reparations</collocation>
haiti
was
a
<collocation>french colony</collocation>
his
refusal
to
that
country
matched
that
of
jacques
chirac


he
was
the
french
president
when
haiti
was
celebrating
its
th
birthday
almost
years
ago
<collocation>haitian president</collocation>
jean
bertrand
aristide
demanded
that
france
repay
haiti
for
the
amount
it
was
forced
to
pay
for
its
freedom
in
aristide
had
sent
paris
a
bill
for
the
amount
he
calculated
it
down
to
the
<collocation>last penny</collocation>
chirac
quickly
said
no


britain
also
still
hasn
t
apologized
for
slavery
activists
say



it
could
be
a
<collocation>long fight</collocation>

blacks
in
america
have
not
succeeded
in
their
efforts
either
attempts
to
have
the
<collocation>courts force</collocation>
the
u
to
<collocation>pay reparations</collocation>
for
slavery
have
gone
nowhere


still

says
she
is
cautiously
hopeful
about
the
<collocation>caribbean community</collocation>
<collocation>latest efforts</collocation>
the
jamaican

is
a
professor
of

you
have
heads

said
russell
this
issue
has
never
been
squarely
put
on
the
table


verene
shepherd
is
a
historian
who
has
fought
a
long
time
for

she
said
people
are
more
aware
about
the
effects
of
slavery
today



remember
slavery
lasted
to
years
in
the
scheme
of
things
we
have
not
been
fighting
a
long
time
