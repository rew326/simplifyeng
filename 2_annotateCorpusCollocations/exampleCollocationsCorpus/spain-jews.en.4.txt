but
few
live

spain
today
spain
forced
them
to
leave

most
jews
moved
to
what

today
turkey
spain
wants
to
make
up
for
that
part
of
its
history
it
will
now
give
<collocation>sephardic jews</collocation>
the
right
to
become
citizens
they
will
be

to
remain
citizens
of

a
trip
to
spain

alhadeff
belongs
to
an
important
sephardic
family
in
seattle
washington
the
city
has
<collocation>sephardic jews</collocation>
in
the
united
states
only
<collocation>new york</collocation>

more
<collocation>sephardic jews</collocation>


alhadeff
grew
up
hearing
her
grandparents
speak
ladino
her
grandmother
used
to
call
her
mi
alma
alhadeff
did
not
think
much
about
it
then
she
went
to
spain
and
heard
someone
in
a
cafe
say
it



i
almost
fell
out
of
my
chair
said
alhadeff
she
found
out
those
were
the
spanish
words
for
my
soul
it
was
one
of
the
things
that
made
her
feel
closer
to
spain


she
lived
in
spain
and
saw
how
it
has
preserved
<collocation>jewish places</collocation>
spain
today
is
not
the
same
as
in
she
said



some
look
to
turkey

still
many
jews
do
not
want
to
become
spanish
they
<collocation>blame spain</collocation>
for
a
<collocation>sad moment</collocation>
in
their
history
they
also
think
it
is
asking
them
for
too
much
to
apply
to
become
a
citizen


victor
amira
was
angry
they
kicked
us
out
and
now
they
re
making
us
go
through
hoops
he
said


new
citizens
have
to
pass
a
spanish
test
they
also
have
to
travel
to
spain


alhadeff
son
<collocation>loren alhadeff</collocation>
said
he
is
excited
he
hopes
the
law
will
build
<collocation>sephardic pride</collocation>
he
has
two
young
children
and
a
busy
job
he
has
to
see
how
hard
it
will
be
before
he
decides
to
apply


other
people
have
doubts
they
think
spain
just
wants
to
bring
in
jewish
money
and
tourism


not
all
<collocation>sephardic jews</collocation>
feel
they
have
roots
in
spain
isaac
azose
has
roots
in
turkey
he
would
rather
<collocation>honor turkey</collocation>
he
said
it
was
the
country
that
took
us
in
