its
fish
comes
from
<collocation>thai food</collocation>
companies
they
are
the
ones
that
use
workers
who
are
kept
like
slaves
many
other
u
and
european
companies
buy
fish
from
thailand
they
all
might
have
the
same
problem
verite
said


the
workers
are
mostly
from
myanmar
and
cambodia
those
countries
are
next
to
thailand
both
are
very
poor
people
want
to
work
in
thailand
they
pay
money
to
get
the
jobs
it
is
against
the
law
to
do
this
though
the
workers
then
become
trapped
they
cannot
leave
until
they
pay
back
the
money
yet
they
owe
more
money
than
they
could
ever
make


the
slave
workers
said
they
do
not
get
much
rest
they
get
little
food
or
water
<collocation>fishing companies</collocation>
do
not
let
them
speak
with
their
friends
or
family


a
worker
from
myanmar
spoke
to
verite
he
said
that
he
has
worked
on
a
<collocation>fishing boat</collocation>
for
years
he
has
no
money
he
said
life
is
very
hard
for
him



a
plan
to
help
the
workers

nestle
said
it
was
angry
about
the
problem
it
promised
to
come
up
with
a
plan
to
stop
it
nestle
also
said
it
will
teach
boat
owners
and
captains
how
to
properly
treat
workers
fairly


<collocation>mark lagon</collocation>
runs
<collocation>freedom house</collocation>
it
is
a
group
trying
to
end
worker
slavery
he
praised
nestle
for
the
report
companies
will
not
always
look
into
reports
of
bad
working
conditions
if
it
is
true
that
workers
are
being
mistreated
the
companies
usually
do
not
tell
anyone
sometimes
a
company
will
not
even
say
it
is
checking
out
the
problem
in
the
first
place

said
