before
women
in
the
united
states
were
not
allowed
to
vote


it
was
not
easy
for
women
to
win
the
right
to
vote
they
had
to
organize
they
marched
and
gave
speeches
sometimes
they
went
to
prison


alice
<collocation>stokes paul</collocation>
was
a
leader
in
the
women
<collocation>rights movement</collocation>
she
helped
create
a
group
called
the
national
woman
party
in
she
worked
at
the
group
washington
d
c
headquarters
for
decades
it
a
<collocation>red brick</collocation>
house
at
the
corner
of
second
street
and
constitution
avenue


even
in
the
if
you
knocked
on
the
door
to
the
house
<collocation>stokes paul</collocation>
herself
might
open
it
and
welcome
you
in



national
woman
party

<collocation>stokes paul</collocation>
died
in
but
the
house
is
still
there
it
called
the
sewall
belmont
house
and
it
is
still
the
headquarters
of
the
national
women
party
today
the
house
is
also
a
museum
of
the
women
<collocation>rights movement</collocation>


despite
its
history
the
museum
is
struggling
there
is
not
enough
money
to
pay
the
employees
and
keep
the
house
fixed
up
page
harrington
said
she
runs
the
house
and
museum


the
house
is
years
old
it
needs
many
<collocation>expensive repairs</collocation>



when
winter
comes
i
m
terrified
of
a
cracked
pipe
in
the
basement
harrington
said
still
she
is
determined
to
keep
the
house
and
museum
open



we
will
<collocation>fight tooth</collocation>
and
nail
she
said



wanting
to
vote
getting
arrested

harrington
wants
to
preserve
the
<collocation>powerful story</collocation>
the
house
tells
it
is
a
story
of
women
working
together
to
fight
for
their
rights


in
many
women
were
arrested
after
protesting
outside
the
<collocation>white house</collocation>
some
of
them
were
sent
to
the
occoquan
workhouse
a
prison
they
were
treated
badly
there


today
a
set
of
steps
from
the
occoquan
workhouse
is
on
display
outside
the
sewall
belmont
house
the
steps
remind
visitors
of
the
sacrifices
made
by
the
women
<collocation>rights pioneers</collocation>


inez
milholland
was
one
of
those
pioneers
even
though
she
was
very
sick
she
continued
to
fight
for
women
rights
she
collapsed
while
giving
a
speech
in
<collocation>los angeles</collocation>
a
month
later
she
died
at
age



history
comes
to
life

inside
the
museum
a
<collocation>wonderful painting</collocation>
<collocation>shows milholland</collocation>
wearing
a
<collocation>white cape</collocation>
and
riding
a
<collocation>white horse</collocation>
that
is
how
she
looked
in
when
she
led
a
parade
through
washington
d
c


there
is
an
old
fashioned
vibe
at
the
sewall
belmont
house
and
museum
there
are
black
and
white
photographs
fading
banners
old
newspapers
the
<collocation>gift shop</collocation>
sells
tea
and
soap


these
<collocation>unusual items</collocation>
have
a
connection
to
the
past
the
national
woman
party
ran
<collocation>tea rooms</collocation>
to
raise
money
they
sold
soap
too
they
were
trying
to
say
that
allowing
women
to
vote
would
help
clean
up
politics



museum
like
a
lifeline


the
museum
is
not
cutting
edge
still
it
is
a
snapshot
of
an
important
time
in
the
fight
for
women
rights



we
are
still
here
harrington
said
it
a
lifeline
to
the
past
it
draws
a
connection
to
the
women
who
came
before
us


in
<collocation>stokes paul</collocation>
was
asked
to
describe
her
part
in
the
struggle
for
women
rights



i
always
feel
the
movement
is
a
sort
of
mosaic
she
said
each
of
us
puts
in
one
little
stone
and
then
you
get
a
<collocation>great mosaic</collocation>
at
the
end
