a
<collocation>huge flood</collocation>
of
water
surrounded
a
year
old
french
town
over
the
weekend
the
flood
was
called
a
supertide
photos
of
the
supertide
were
all
over
the
internet


the
town
that
the
supertide
surrounded
is
famous
for
its
abbey
an
abbey
is
a
home
for
religious
men
called
monks
the
abbey
is
usually
surrounded
by
some
water
but
only
a
little
sheep
generally
are
all
around
the
town
not
water


the
flood
of
water
was
almost
feet
high
thousands
of
people
came
to
watch
the
water
surround
mont
saint
michel
the
tiny
town
around
the
abbey
people
usually
can
only
get
to
mont
saint
michel
by
one
bridge
that
bridge
was
under
the
water



supertide
was
right
on
schedule

most
news
stories
did
not
explain
why
there
was
a
supertide
some
mentioned
the
sun
or
the
moon
some
said
the
sun
and
the
moon
were
lined
up
<collocation>other articles</collocation>
talked
about
the
eclipse
that
occurred
the
same
day
an
eclipse
happens
when
the
moon
is
between
the
sun
and
the
earth


many
called
the
march
event
the
tide
of
the
century
but
this
tide
happens
every
years
not
every
it
last
happened
in
march
the
next
one
will
be
in
march



sun
and
<collocation>moon team</collocation>
up

so
what
caused
the
supertide
the
march
in
the
dates
is
an
important
clue
tides
happen
because
of
the
pull
of
gravity
from
the
moon
the
sun
<collocation>gravity matters</collocation>
too
but
it
has
less
pull
when
the
sun
and
moon
are
lined
up
with
the
earth
their
combined
pull
is
strongest
this
causes
what
are
called
<collocation>spring tides</collocation>
they
occur
twice
every
month
but
are
often
greatest
in
march
and
september
during
the
spring
and
autumn
equinoxes


this
year
the
moon
and
sun
lined
up
exactly
this
caused
saturday
eclipse
if
we
see
a
solar
eclipse
there
will
be
a
<collocation>spring tide</collocation>
said
hal
needham
he
is
a
scientist
who
<collocation>studies weather</collocation>
at
<collocation>louisiana state</collocation>
university


that
explains
why
the
<collocation>highest tides</collocation>
happen
in
march
but
why
do
they
happen
every
years
this
gets
trickier
the
best
explanation
comes
from
britain
met
office
which
<collocation>reports weather</collocation>



moon
plays
an
important
role

experts
at
the
met
said
that
some
<collocation>spring tides</collocation>
are
higher
than
others
it
happens
because
tides
are
high
when
the
moon
is
closest
to
the
earth
that
force
becomes
stronger
when
the
moon
is
also
directly
over
the
equator
it
becomes
even
stronger
still
if
both
the
sun
and
the
moon
are
directly
over
the
equator
the
group
said
the
sun
is
above
the
equator
around
march
or
in
september
the
<collocation>moon travels</collocation>
around
the
earth
in
an
orbit
the
orbit
takes
it
above
and
below
the
equator
over
a
period
of
days


the
met
said
that
there
are
very
large
<collocation>spring tides</collocation>
when
all
these
things
happen
at
once
the
moon
is
closest
to
the
earth
and
is
over
the
equator
about
once
every
years


we
get
a
supertide
when
three
things
happen
the
moon
and
sun
line
up
they
are
right
over
the
equator
and
the
moon
is
closest
to
earth



there
can
be
hurricanes
too

however
needham
said
weather
can
matter
more
than
anything
he
pointed
out
<collocation>hurricane sandy</collocation>
in
the
area
around
<collocation>new york</collocation>
city
and
hurricane
katrina
in
<collocation>new orleans</collocation>
one
year
supertide
might
be
higher
than
another
it
depends
on
whether
winds
are
pushing
water
up
against
a
coastline
lower
than
normal
pressure
in
the
air
around
the
earth
can
cause
the
sea
to
<collocation>rise higher</collocation>
