it
wants

many
people
are
not
happy

like
it

label
idea
many
of
the
comments

groups
that
want
the

put
less
sugar
in
food
they
hope
people
will
stop
buying
foods
if
they
know
how
much
sugar
is
in
them


<collocation>food makers</collocation>
know
this
will

sharp
she

what
about
the
cranberries


<collocation>food industry</collocation>
officials
say
the
plan
is
not
needed
right
now
<collocation>food labels</collocation>
give
the
total
amount
of
sugar
in
an
item
the
number
includes
the
sugars
already
in
a
food
and
the
amount
that
is
added
sugar
is
sugar
they
say
there
is
no
proof
that
one
type
of
sugar
should
be
labeled
by
itself


andrew
briscoe
is
the
president
of
the
<collocation>sugar association</collocation>
he
wrote
that
science
does
not
show
a
reason
for
the
<collocation>extra sugar</collocation>
labeling
he
said
it
sets
a
bad
example


dozens
of
<collocation>food makers</collocation>
are
mad
about
the
label
change


the
<collocation>cranberry companies</collocation>
are
the
most
upset
over
the
summer
the
governors
of
wisconsin
and
massachusetts
wrote
to
the
fda
they
said
that
the
plan
was
unfair
to
companies
making
<collocation>cranberry products</collocation>
cranberries
are
very
bitter
fruits
they
would
<collocation>taste bad</collocation>
without
<collocation>extra sugar</collocation>



sugar
equals
fat

the
campbell
soup
company
made
a
different
kind
of
argument
it
said
that
the
added
information
could
make
<collocation>americans fatter</collocation>


the
sugar
details
could
confuse
people
it
wrote
to
the
fda
people
would
stop
thinking
about
eating
<collocation>fewer calories</collocation>
foods
with
too
many
calories
make
people
<collocation>gain weight</collocation>
but
so
does
sugar


supporters
say
that
companies
secretly
add
unhealthy
amounts
of
sugar
to
foods



that
one
line
on
a
label
seems
like
a
small
thing
said
deborah
bailin
she
is
with
the
union
of
<collocation>concerned scientists</collocation>
not
having
it
covers
up
a
very
big
fact
that
there
is
too
much
sugar
in
food
food
companies
do
not
want
people
to
know
about
that



things
they
want
you
to
think
are
healthy
are
full
of
sugar
she
said


the
environmental
working
group
studied
food
products
it
found
nearly
out
of
had
<collocation>extra sugar</collocation>
added
that
included
most
deli
meats
in
supermarkets
