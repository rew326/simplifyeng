always
pushing
their
students
to
do
better

works
better
when

help
motivate
our
students
more
than

see
<collocation>success standing</collocation>

nonwhite
students
are
not
the
only
ones
who
would
be
helped
by
having
more
minority
teachers

ulrich
boser
it
would
even
help
in
places
where
there
are
not
a
lot
of
minority
students
