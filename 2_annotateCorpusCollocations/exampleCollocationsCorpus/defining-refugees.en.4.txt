it
took
<collocation>asein ta</collocation>
three
days
to
walk
to
safety
to
escape
an
<collocation>unsafe situation</collocation>
in
his
home
country
he
made
a
dangerous
trip
through
mountains
he
followed
his
uncle
who
made
the
trip
by
hobbling
on
one
leg



he
said
there
was
good
out
there
something
different
ta
said


the
two
left
their
native
country
of
myanmar
also
known
as
burma
it
is
located
in
<collocation>southeast asia</collocation>
the
two
were
refugees
like
other
refugees
they
were
leaving
a
dangerous
situation
at
home
to
live
somewhere
else
they
went
to
a
<collocation>refugee camp</collocation>
in
thailand
ta
was
not
even
a
teenager
then


now
he
is
ta
mother
sent
him
away
to
keep
him
safe
she
died
soon
after
he
left



help
finding
a
new
home

five
years
later
ta
was
on
a
plane
to
virginia
he
was
helped
by
a
program
called
unaccompanied
refugee
minors
urm
the
u
government
runs
the
program
to
help
children
for
years
it
has
helped
them
after
they
have
escaped
war
and
<collocation>natural disasters</collocation>
like
earthquakes
it
has
helped
children
from
all
around
the
world


the
program
lets
refugee
children
stay
in
america
it
places
them
with
<collocation>foster parents</collocation>


ta
was
clearly
a
refugee
he
was
part
of
a
minority
group
that
was
in
danger


there
are
questions
about
whether
children
coming
to
the
united
states
from
central
america
are
actually
refugees



two
groups
disagree

recently
there
has
been
a
<collocation>huge increase</collocation>
in
<collocation>central american</collocation>
children
traveling
alone
to
the
united
states
they
leave
their
countries
and
travel
through
mexico
then
they
cross
the
border
to
get
into
the
u
in
fewer
than
children
crossed
the
border
but
in
about
made
the
trip


they
are
trying
to
escape
crime
and
violence
some
people
think
urm
should
help
them


the
united
nations
says
the
<collocation>central american</collocation>
children
are
refugees
some
have
been
victims
of
kidnapping
or
other
crimes
the
united
nations
believes
they
should
be
able
to
move
to
other
countries
for
safety


the
u
government
does
not
consider
the
children
refugees
if
they
did
the
children
could
use
the
urm
program
to
stay
in
the
united
states



how
to
help
best

the
urm
size
is
another
problem
urm
assisted
children
in
today
it
only
helps
about
even
if
they
were
considered
to
be
refugees
it
is
not
clear
that
the
program
could
help
many
of
the
<collocation>central american</collocation>
kids


some
argue
that
calling
them
refugees
would
be
the
best
way
to
help
kimberly
haynes
is
one
of
those
people
she
works
for
a
charity
that
helps
children
through
urm


haynes
says
that
both
the
<collocation>central american</collocation>
children
and
past
refugees
from
other
parts
of
the
world
face
the
same
problems
the
situations
are
pretty
horrific
she
said


<collocation>urm programs</collocation>
help
refugees
get
<collocation>legal aid</collocation>
education
housing
and
<collocation>health care</collocation>
more
children
are
using
the
program
recently
in
there
were
children
in
the
program
by
there
were



what
is
it
like
at
home


a
report
found
that
one
third
of
the
children
in
the
program
were
from
<collocation>latin america</collocation>
many
were
from
honduras
guatemala
and
mexico


the
way
to
determine
if
someone
is
a
refugee
and
can
use
urm
is
to
study
the
situation
of
the
children
in
their
home
countries
the
government
plans
to
do
that
more


<collocation>president barack</collocation>
obama
said
some
<collocation>central american</collocation>
children
are
refugees
they
might
be
able
to
apply
in
<collocation>certain cases</collocation>


he
warned
that
not
everybody
will
make
it
people
cannot
be
refugees
just
because
they
live
in
a
bad
neighborhood
or
poverty
