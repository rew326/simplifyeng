russians
worry
tatars

<collocation>last week</collocation>
russia
sent
soldiers
into
crimea
their
presence
has
stirred
up
memories
of
war
hunger
and
death
for
the
abdulkerimovs


he
now
worries
that
<collocation>russian troops</collocation>
and
<collocation>local russians</collocation>
will
attack
the
<collocation>crimean tatars</collocation>
there
are
tatars
in
the
crimea
the
tatars
will
be
forced
away
again
he
said



if
somebody
tells
me
today
that
another
deportation
is
possible
i
would
tell
him
that
he
is
an
idiot
said
abdulkerimov


but
if
somebody
told
him
<collocation>last week</collocation>
that
his
land
would
be
invaded
again
i
would
have
told
him
he
was
an
idiot
too
he
added


few
seriously
think
the
tatars
will
be
forced
to
leave
so
far
the
<collocation>russian occupation</collocation>
has
been
peaceful
but
tatars
are
afraid
they
are
mostly
muslim
the
crimea
has
many
russians
these
russian
want
russia
to
control
the
crimea


again
the
tatars
become
the
most
powerless
people
in
crimea
said
mustafa
dzhemilev
he
is
a
lawmaker
and
a
<collocation>crimean tatar</collocation>
activist



we
will
fight
back



who
will
prevent
them
from
doing
something
totally
absurd
like
voting
to
kick
us
out
once
again
dzhemilev
asked


but
many
russian
say
that
the
tatars
want
to
control
the
crimea
they
believe
the
tatars
want
to
have
their
own
country



the
tatars
should
watch
their
step
now
said
alexander
zhilkin
he
carried
a
<collocation>russian flag</collocation>
now
that
our
people
are
in
power
here
we
won
t
allow
any
separatism
inside
our
republic


a
pro
russian
<collocation>crimean lawmaker</collocation>
said
the
tatars
are
not
in
danger


but
the
men
of
abdulkerimov
community
don
t
believe
the
lawmaker
they
guard
the
streets
at
night
and
<collocation>fear attacks</collocation>
by
russians


when
the
soviets
deported
emir
shevkiev
family
in
the
men
were
all
at
war
they
couldn
t
protect
their
families
we
are
here
and
we
will
fight
back

shevkiev
a
<collocation>local tatar</collocation>
