u
teens
had
a
hard
time
getting
jobs
this
summer
in
fact
<collocation>teen employment</collocation>
has
been
stuck
around
<collocation>record lows</collocation>
for
four
summers
in
a
row
experts
say
this
could
lead
to
a
<collocation>dim future</collocation>
for
today
youth


in
slightly
more
than
half
of
teens
to
worked
a
summer
job
less
than
a
third
of
teens
did
this
year



we
have
never
had
anything
this
low
in
our
lives
this
is
a
<collocation>great depression</collocation>
for
teens
said
<collocation>andrew sum</collocation>
he
studies
the
<collocation>job market</collocation>
that
why
it
such
an
<collocation>important story</collocation>


the
overall
jobs
picture
is
getting
better
in
the
united
states
just
not
for
teens
businesses
are
adding
hundreds
of
thousands
of
jobs
but
those
jobs
aren
t
going
to
teenagers



worse
for
black
and
<collocation>hispanic teens</collocation>

summer
is
usually
the
time
when
the
most
<collocation>teens work</collocation>
they
are
off
from
school
for
many
it
a
chance
to
work
for
the
first
time
they
get
to
learn
the
responsibilities
that
come
with
working


the
job
picture
looks
even
worse
when
broken
down
by
race
sum
and
his
coworkers
did
just
that
they
compared
june
and
july
and
the
same
two
months
of
in
about
of
white
teens
to
held
a
job
that
number
fell
to
about
in
this
summer


a
bit
more
than
of
black
to
year
olds
held
a
job
in
that
fell
to
below
in
this
june
and
july
it
wasn
t
much
better
for
hispanics
they
saw
the
number
fall
from
of
in
to
less
than
of
in


there
was
a
<collocation>big surprise</collocation>
in
the
research
too
teens
whose
parents
were
rich
were
more
likely
to
have
a
job
than
those
whose
parents
made
less
money


this
is
important
a
large
amount
of
research
shows
that
teens
who
work
do
better
socially
and
financially



kids
that
get
work
experience
when
they
are
or
end
up
graduating
from
college
at
a
<collocation>higher rate</collocation>
said
<collocation>michael gritton</collocation>
he
runs
the
workforce
investment
board
the
group
works
to
create
jobs
and
for
<collocation>teen employment</collocation>



getting
harder
to
find
work


almost
every
person
you
ask
remembers
their
first
job
because
they
started
to
learn
things
from
the
world
of
work
that
they
can
t
learn
in
the
classroom


the
u
government
keeps
track
of
how
many
teens
are
working


<collocation>workers aged</collocation>
to
made
up
less
of
the
workforce
even
before
<collocation>things got</collocation>
really
bad
in
part
of
the
reason
was
that
more
people
were
going
to
college
this
had
been
happening
for
many
years
also
universities
now
care
less
about
work
they
care
more
about
things
you
have
experienced
in
life
and
about
<collocation>community service</collocation>


but
<collocation>things got</collocation>
a
lot
worse
for
teens
when
businesses
got
hit
bad
in
older
workers
took
more
of
the
jobs
that
teens
used
to
hold


so
people
who
want
to
get
jobs
in
their
won
t
have
any
work
experience
said
<collocation>keith hall</collocation>
he
worked
for
the
u
government
from
to
his
department
collected
important
information
about
the
<collocation>job market</collocation>


one
problem
is
that
business
has
not
grown
much
since
the
<collocation>great recession</collocation>
of
that
means
older
workers
aren
t
moving
up
so
younger
workers
won
t
move
up
as
fast
as
they
used
to
either
