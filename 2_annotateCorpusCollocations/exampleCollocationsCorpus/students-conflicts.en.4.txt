trouble
started
on
facebook
do
you
have
a

marquita
riley
and
<collocation>aaliyah hudson</collocation>
ended
up
in
<collocation>manley high</collocation>
school
<collocation>peace room</collocation>
by
then
things
were
worse
people
in
school
said
that
the
two
girls
were
going
to
fight


aaliyah
did
not
want
a
fight
she
could
get
suspended
for
days
so
she
went
to
the
<collocation>peace room</collocation>
a
counselor
there
could
help
the
girls
talk
it
out


the
girls
sat
in
a
circle
of
chairs
they
talked
and
listened
to
each
other
until
they
solved
their
problems



i
came
down
here
and
talked
before
i
reacted
aaliyah
said
after
their
visit
to
the
<collocation>peace room</collocation>



talking
and
listening
to
each
other

the
<collocation>peace room</collocation>
at
manley
is
part
of
a
new
program
the
goal
is
to
teach
people
how
to
solve
conflicts
it
tries
to
bring
together
people
who
are
angry
at
one
another
so
that
they
can
work
through
their
problems


the
idea
is
used
in
schools
churches
and
other
places
in
chicago
it
teaches
young
people
how
to
understand
their
anger
and
handle
problems
before
violence
happens
it
is
also
being
used
instead
of
suspensions
and
arrests


the
idea
seems
simple
if
something
bad
happens
there
needs
to
be
a
way
to
restore
order
said
ilana
zafran
she
works
for
a
group
that
helps
set
up
the
program
in
chicago
schools


chicago
has
had
many
shootings
and
killings
among
youths
activists
ministers
and
principals
are
turning
to
restorative
justice
to
stop
the
violence


restorative
justice
makes
everybody
in
an
<collocation>argument talk</collocation>
instead
of
fight
there
may
still
be
punishment
for
doing
something
wrong
but
the
idea
is
to
find
out
what
is
upsetting
people
and
think
of
ways
to
fix
it



the
assumption
is
if
you
are
a
teenager
you
know
everything
about
how
to
act
and
behave
zafran
said
but
that
not
true



not
easy
but
worth
a
try

supporters
admit
that
it
is
complicated
it
is
also
difficult
to
tell
if
the
program
is
working
but
it
is
worth
trying
experts
say



the
idea
that
if
we
punish
hard
enough
they
won
t
do
it
again
has
not
worked

<collocation>fenger academy</collocation>
is
another
chicago
<collocation>high school</collocation>
that
has
a
<collocation>peace room</collocation>
students
teachers
and
staff
can
go
there
to
work
out
problems


people
who
have
a
problem
sit
together
and
can
talk
about
their
feelings
without
being
interrupted


in
a
student
was
killed
in
a
fight
at
fenger
after
that
the
school
decided
to
try
the
<collocation>peace room</collocation>


students
often
talk
about
gangs
when
they
are
in
the
<collocation>peace rooms</collocation>
they
talk
about
problems
they
have
at
home


before
she
started
<collocation>high school</collocation>
geneva
harris
said
she
called
<collocation>others names</collocation>
she
had
a
<collocation>bad attitude</collocation>
but
at
fenger
another
student
asked
why
she
acted
this
way


the
other
student
taught
harris
how
to
work
through
her
problems
then
she
also
became
a
person
who
helps
students
solve
conflicts
now
she
pulls
her
friends
and
family
members
into
a
circle
to
talk
out
their
problems



now
i
m
a
people
person
she
said
i
m
like
the
<collocation>older sister</collocation>
among
my
friends



cooling
off
tensions

the
<collocation>manley high</collocation>
school
<collocation>peace room</collocation>
was
busy
one
<collocation>recent afternoon</collocation>
marquita
and
aaliyah
were
there
they
were
the
two
girls
who
were
supposed
to
be
getting
ready
for
a
major
fight



people
came
up
to
me
and
said
you
wanted
to
fight
me
marquita
said
to
aaliyah



if
you
thought
i
had
a
problem
with
you
you
could
have
come
to
talk
to
me
aaliyah
told
marquita


after
talking
for
another
minutes
they
agreed
they
had
simply
misunderstood
each
other
the
girls
decided
they
would
not
fight
they
promised
they
would
talk
if
they
had
problems
again
