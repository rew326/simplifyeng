jobs
might
be
one
way
to
make
the
world
a
little
bit
safer
a
new
program
in
chicago
found
jobs
for
some
teenagers
then
a
study
showed
that
if
teens
have
jobs
the
number
of
<collocation>violent crimes</collocation>
they
do
may
go
down


scientists
wanted
to
see
if
having
a
job
changes
the
way
<collocation>somebody acts</collocation>
so
they
picked
teenagers
then
they
gave
each
one
a
job
for
eight
weeks
while
they
were
working
the
teens
were
arrested
for
<collocation>violent crimes</collocation>
fewer
times
than
teenagers
who
did
not
work
it
was
not
just
because
they
were
too
busy
working
to
get
in
trouble
even
after
the
jobs
ended
the
teenagers
did
fewer
<collocation>violent crimes</collocation>



not
everything
improved

there
were
teens
who
wanted
to
take
part
in
the
study
only
were
chosen
the
scientists
looked
at
the
number
of
arrests
by
the
teens
in
the
study
then
they
compared
that
to
the
number
by
the
kids
that
were
not
chosen


one
thing
did
not
improve
the
amount
of
crimes
that
were
not
violent
did
not
go
down
for
the
teens
with
jobs


sara
heller
was
in
charge
of
the
study
she
is
a
college
professor


most
of
the
teenagers
in
the
study
were
from
families
without
a
lot
of
money
some
of
them
had
been
in
trouble
with
the
law
one
out
of
every
five
of
the
teens
had
been
arrested
before



an
adult
was
there
to
help

the
teens
learned
many
skills
during
their
work
they
learned
how
to
handle
difficult
problems
they
also
learned
how
to
control
their
moods
and
act
like
adults
some
of
these
skills
may
have
helped
keep
them
out
of
<collocation>serious trouble</collocation>


the
teens
in
the
study
also
had
an
adult
to
help
them
out
the
adult
was
a
mentor
the
mentor
gave
advice
about
work
and
life


the
chicago
program
was
called
one
<collocation>summer plus</collocation>
the
teens
in
the
program
were
paid
for
every
hour
that
they
worked
they
worked
hours
each
week


one
<collocation>summer plus</collocation>
lasted
a
shorter
time
than
other
job
programs
it
also
cost
less
money
heller
said
it
was
too
soon
to
know
if
the
program
was
a
good
use
of
money
researchers
will
need
to
collect
information
on
the
teenagers
in
the
future
they
will
need
to
see
if
they
find
jobs
and
how
long
they
work


teens
in
the
study
held
many
different
kinds
of
jobs
they
helped
at
day
camps
cleaned
up
chicago
planted
gardens
and
worked
in
offices
the
jobs
were
not
always
exciting
the
study
wanted
to
teach
teenagers
that
your
first
job
is
not
always
perfect
