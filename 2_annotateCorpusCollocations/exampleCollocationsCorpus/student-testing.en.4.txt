washington
it
is
testing
time
in
schools
all
over
the
country


experts
say
that
students
are
taking
more
tests
than
ever
many
people
say
it
is
too
many


meanwhile
lawmakers
say
they
have
received
many
complaints
about
testing



fewer
better
tests

this
spring
lawmakers
are
trying
to
rewrite
a
law
the
no
child
left
behind
law
was
created
to
improve
education
in
all
schools
the
law
says
that
students
must
be
tested
every
year
the
purpose
is
to
make
sure
that
schools
are
doing
their
job


an
agreement
in
the
united
states
senate
might
reduce
the
number
of
tests
the
senate
is
one
of
the
two
houses
of
congress
which
makes
laws
for
the
country
the
agreement
would
make
states
responsible
for
testing
not
the
national
government
the
states
could
also
decide
what
to
do
about
the
schools
that
have
low
<collocation>test scores</collocation>


senators
lamar
alexander
of
tennessee
and
<collocation>patty murray</collocation>
of
washington
are
on
the
<collocation>education committee</collocation>
they
say
the
new
law
should
have
fewer
and
better
tests


congress
still
needs
to
vote
on
the
agreement
any
kind
of
change
is
still
some
time
away
meanwhile
complaints
about
the
amount
of
testing
are
growing



we
need
fewer
better
and
fairer
tests
said
susie
morrison
she
is
an
official
with
the
illinois
<collocation>state board</collocation>
of
education


morrison
is
not
against
testing
she
said
that
parents
need
to
know
how
their
children
are
doing
in
school
a
large
number
of
students
graduate
from
<collocation>high school</collocation>
but
need
extra
help
before
college
they
did
not
learn
what
they
were
supposed
to
learn
in
<collocation>high school</collocation>
and
no
one
realized
it
testing
shows
what
students
know
and
do
not
know
she
said


morrison
said
that
not
all
tests
are
good
<collocation>school districts</collocation>
should
stop
using
some
of
them


<collocation>education secretary</collocation>
arne
duncan
is
in
charge
of
the
government
department
of
education
he
thinks
the
government
should
remain
in
charge
of
testing
for
the
entire
country
he
does
agree
that
students
spend
too
much
time
taking
tests
they
also
spend
too
much
class
time
preparing
for
them
he
said



more
parents
say
no

in
florida
rosemarie
jensen
is
one
of
the
leaders
of
united
opt
out
the
group
encourages
parents
to
refuse
<collocation>standardized tests</collocation>
for
their
kids
opt
out
means
to
choose
not
to
do
something
jensen
said
the
number
of
parents
against
testing
is
growing
in
florida
she
said
there
are
opt
out
groups
alone


testing
is
not
a
good
way
to
measure
a
child
said
jensen
she
is
a
<collocation>former kindergarten</collocation>
teacher
who
has
two
children
in
<collocation>high school</collocation>



none
of
this
has
anything
to
do
with
better
education
she
said


in
her
own
family
jensen
said
her
daughter
does
well
on
tests
on
the
other
hand
her
son
is
a
good
student
but
a
bad
test
taker


her
son
low
<collocation>test scores</collocation>
make
his
teachers
look
bad
although
they
are
good
teachers
they
work
so
hard
with
him
she
said
that
not
fair



<collocation>tests repeat</collocation>
each
other

debbie
veney
is
with
the
<collocation>education trust</collocation>
the
group
helps
students
from
poor
families
she
said
too
many
<collocation>tests repeat</collocation>
each
other
some
of
them
do
not
give
schools
useful
information



however
are
tests
necessary
absolutely
she
said
it
is
not
enough
just
to
test
students
to
see
how
well
they
can
read
or
do
math
schools
need
to
be
able
to
help
students
who
are
not
keeping
up

said
