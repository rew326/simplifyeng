havana
in
a
music
workshop
in
cuba
three
men
carefully
examine
<collocation>various string</collocation>
instruments
all
need
to
be
repaired
they
have
been
bent
out
of
tune
by
years
of
use


cuba
is
famous
for
its
music
these
days
however
it
has
a
problem
it
is
running
low
on
<collocation>musical instruments</collocation>
<collocation>andres martinez</collocation>
and
his
two
workers
are
doing
what
they
can
to
help


cuba
has
dozens
of
free
music
schools
each
year
they
turn
out
thousands
of
<collocation>skilled young</collocation>
musicians
many
play
instruments
imported
from
other
countries
often
such
instruments
can
only
be
repaired
with
hard
to
find
materials
from
overseas


<collocation>string instruments</collocation>
like
violins
violas
and
cellos
are
tricky
they
are
some
of
the
<collocation>hardest instruments</collocation>
to
keep
in
good
working
order



repairing
building
and
training

before
cuba
revolution
many
musicians
played
<collocation>string instruments</collocation>
made
in
europe
after
the
revolution
cuba
was
cut
off
from
doing
business
with
many
other
countries
getting
instruments
from
<collocation>western europe</collocation>
became
much
more
difficult


for
many
years
russia
provided
cuba
with
violins
and
cellos
these
days
students
must
make
do
with
<collocation>inexpensive violins</collocation>
from
china
but
<collocation>chinese violins</collocation>
often
pop
strings
or
have
other
problems


martinez
and
his
helpers
<collocation>repair dozens</collocation>
of
instruments
a
year
they
also
build
a
few
from
scratch
in
addition
they
train
young
people
to
make
violins



we
do
everything
here
martinez
said


martinez
workshop
opened
three
years
ago
since
then
more
than
violins
violas
and
cellos
have
been
repaired
in
addition
they
have
built
a
dozen
high
quality
new
violins
the
workshop
also
lends
instruments
to
musicians
who
need
them
for
concerts


<collocation>martinez uses</collocation>
high
quality
tools
for
his
repairs
he
takes
pride
in
his
work
<collocation>such quality</collocation>
he
says
cannot
be
found
among
untrained
repairmen
some
<collocation>use hammers</collocation>
to
<collocation>fix violins</collocation>



fiddle
making
isn
t
carpentry
he
said



keeping
the
cuban
<collocation>music alive</collocation>

in
the
past
cuba
did
have
a
handful
of
<collocation>excellent violin</collocation>
repairmen
however
they
have
since
left
the
country
or
died
martinez
workshop
is
making
up
for
their
loss



this
workshop
fills
a
great
need
music
<collocation>expert miriam</collocation>
escudero
said


cuba
had
a
<collocation>violin factory</collocation>
during
the
however
the
wood
in
cuba
is
not
very
good
for
making
some
instruments
it
has
nowhere
near
the
quality
of
the
best
<collocation>european woods</collocation>
like
maple


right
now
martinez
workshop
needs
money
to
stay
open
some
of
it
comes
from
a
<collocation>belgian group</collocation>
called
fiddlemakers
without
frontiers
martinez
says
he
hopes
the
workshop
will
soon
make
enough
money
so
it
will
not
need
help


whether
or
not
martinez
succeeds
isn
t
only
important
to
him
the
future
of
cuban
music
may
depend
just
a
little
on
his
workshop



it
like
with
people
said
<collocation>juan carlos</collocation>
prado
one
of
martinez
workers
if
you
feel
bad
you
need
a
doctor
the
same
thing
happens
with
a
<collocation>musical instrument</collocation>
if
it
isn
t
working
well
you
can
hear
it
in
the
music
