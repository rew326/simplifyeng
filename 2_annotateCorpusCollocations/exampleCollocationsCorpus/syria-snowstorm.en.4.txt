a
curtain
to
show
a
bare
kitchen

a
little
food
sometimes
rats
attacked
the
kitchen



it

<collocation>awadh lives</collocation>
in
a
another

in
the

has
tents
the
tents
have
<collocation>concrete floors</collocation>
and
<collocation>blue plastic</collocation>
sheeting

provides
some
protection
from
the

and
snow



thinking
of
loved
ones
back
home

about
people
live
in
the
camp
most
of
the
tents
appear
to
have
portable
heaters
and
stoves
some
have
electricity
still
people
complain
that
aid
only
comes
occasionally
also
signing
children
up
for
schools
is
next
to
impossible
finding
a
job
is
only
a
dream


as
the
<collocation>sun shone</collocation>
people
cleared
garbage
out
of
their
tents
they
hung
their
<collocation>wet clothes</collocation>
to
dry
and
gathered
firewood
for
many
this
is
not
their
first
winter
away
from
home
their
situation
is
difficult
they
say
but
not
life
threatening
their
thoughts
remain
with
loved
ones
back
in
syria
people
there
face
daily
fighting
they
also
cannot
get
<collocation>regular supplies</collocation>
of
food
fuel
and
water


outside
of
damascus
<collocation>um ammar</collocation>
has
been
told
desperate
people
are
burning
school
desks
and
clothing
for
heat
the
situation
is
terrible
yet
syrians
here
seem
to
want
to
go
back
as
soon
as
possible


many
ask
<collocation>foreign visitors</collocation>
about
the
chance
for
peace
will
there
be
talks
at
the
united
nations
next
month
they
ask
they
are
keen
for
any
sign
of
progress
in
the
war


many
say
they
were
lucky
to
be
in
lebanon
instead
of
syria



we
cannot
complain
too
much
said
<collocation>um mahmoud</collocation>
after
all
we
escaped
from
death
