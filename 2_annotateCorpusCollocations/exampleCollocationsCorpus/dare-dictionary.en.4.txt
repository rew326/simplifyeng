the
year
old
dictionary
of
<collocation>american regional</collocation>
english
is
in
danger
of
coming
to
an
end
in
a
few
months
money
will
run
out
people
could
lose
their
jobs


the
dictionary
is
often
called
by
its
acronym
dare
it
has
words
from
different
groups
across
the
country
these
words
come
from
newspapers
books
maps
and
many
other
places


the
dictionary
shows
the
varieties
in
the
<collocation>english language</collocation>
there
are
many
different
words
to
explain
the
same
thing
for
example
the
word
dragonfly
has
words
that
come
from
<collocation>different regions</collocation>
or
locations
in
the
united
states
the
dictionary
explains
america
story
the
country
is
made
up
of
immigrants
who
came
from
other
countries
to
live
in
america
these
immigrants
brought
new
words
with
them
the
irish
brought
the
<collocation>word brogan</collocation>
which
means
a
heavy
work
shoe
the
italians
brought
vino
a
term
for
wine
the
germans
gave
us
hausfrau
for
housewife
and
the
polish
brought
over
paczki
a
filled
doughnut


finding
these
words
may
seem
strange
but
it
can
be
useful



how
is
your
ticklebox


a
couple
of
months
ago
douglas
kelling
a
doctor
in
north
carolina
was
treating
an
year
old
woman
the
patient
asked
doc
how
my
ticklebox
the
confused
doctor
asked
what
she
meant
by
ticklebox
well
my
heart
the
woman
answered


the
doctor
has
heard
patients
use
many
<collocation>regional terms</collocation>
for
illnesses
but
he
had
never
heard
this
word
before
kelling
believes
the
dictionary
is
valuable
in
helping
to
understand
his
patients
better


dare
is
being
worked
on
at
the
university
of
wisconsin
it
finished
its
final
chapters
including
<collocation>z words</collocation>
in
a
<collocation>digital dictionary</collocation>
was
published
in
december



the
project
is
in
danger

for
years
dare
has
had
problems
with
money
but
they
always
managed
to
find
<collocation>last minute</collocation>
donations
but
this
time
the
project
will
begin
its
year
with
less
than
it
is
a
lot
less
money
than
it
usually
needs


joan
<collocation>houston hall</collocation>
is
the
<collocation>head editor</collocation>
of
the
dictionary
she
has
spent
almost
years
working
on
it
recently
she
sent
notices
to
all
four
of
the
people
who
work
for
dare
that
they
might
lose
their
jobs
without
more
money
for
the
dictionary
she
will
also
lose
her
job



i
believe
in
this
project
it
has
been
an
important
gift
to
the
nation
and
there
is
still
work
to
be
done
hall
said


however
right
now
people
continue
to
work
on
the
dictionary



they
hope
the
dictionary
has
a
future

<collocation>hall looks</collocation>
up
the
<collocation>word bittern</collocation>
which
describes
a
marsh
bird
she
admires
the
more
than
<collocation>regional choices</collocation>


these
differences
in
language
show
that
america
is
not
losing
its
diversity
of
words
there
are
still
a
lot
of
different
words
coming
from
<collocation>various parts</collocation>
of
the
country


new
words
are
being
used
in
different
areas
from
coast
to
coast
hall
has
discovered
that
since
the
dictionary
began
people
in
wisconsin
have
begun
to
change
their
word
for
a
soft
drink


people
used
to
call
it
pop
hall
said
but
now
most
people
call
it
soda


goebel
also
has
been
working
to
make
the
dictionary
more
modern
a
lot
of
the
information
is
still
kept
on
paper
slips
these
slips
were
collected
in
the
by
dare
workers
who
were
traveling
across
america
talking
to
people
and
learning
about
new
words
now
goebel
will
be
putting
this
information
into
the
computer


he
is
doing
this
to
save
the
dictionary
future
he
said
if
there
is
one
we
have
to
go
as
if
there
is
