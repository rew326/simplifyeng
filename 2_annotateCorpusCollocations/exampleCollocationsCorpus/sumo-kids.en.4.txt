japan
chikara
yamanobe
wants
to
be
a
<collocation>sumo wrestler</collocation>
he
has
a
<collocation>long way</collocation>
to
go
he
is
so
skinny
his
ribs
stick
out
he
sometimes
cries
when
he
is
pushed
in
the
<collocation>sumo ring</collocation>


chikara
is
also
only
years
old


sumo
is
a
<collocation>japanese sport</collocation>
in
sumo
two
wrestlers
try
to
push
each
other
out
of
a
ring



i
want
to
be
like
endo
said
chikara
endo
is
a
<collocation>japanese sumo</collocation>
star



many
kids
are
not
interested
anymore

it
is
not
likely

will
make
it


sumo
is
not
as
popular
as
it
used
to
be
boys

better

used
to
be
a
very
<collocation>japanese sport</collocation>

are
told
how
