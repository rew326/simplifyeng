scientists
have
learned
something
new
about
the
<collocation>international space</collocation>
station
they
found
out
there
are
more
germs
in
space
than
they
thought


the
<collocation>space station</collocation>
flies
about
miles
above
earth
astronauts
live
on
the
<collocation>space station</collocation>
they
are
working
to
learn
more
about
space



are
<collocation>space germs</collocation>
bad
for
astronauts


nasa
runs
the
u
space
program
it
may
send
people
on
long
space
trips
one
day
one
long
trip
could
be
to
the
<collocation>planet mars</collocation>
nasa
wants
to
learn
as
much
as
possible
about
the
germs
on
their
spaceships
they
do
not
want
the
germs
to
make
the
<collocation>astronauts sick</collocation>


nasa
has
been
keeping
track
of
the
germs
that
live
on
the
<collocation>space station</collocation>
the
scientists
have
been
<collocation>gathering dust</collocation>
from
different
parts
of
the
station
inside
the
dust
are
germs
then
the
scientists
grow
the
germs
in
labs
the
idea
was
to
see
what
types
of
germs
are
found


there
was
a
problem
though
some
germs
are
hard
to
grow
in
a
lab
while
other
germs
grow
fine
this
makes
the
results
confusing
scientists
may
not
have
been
able
to
find
out
all
the
germs
that
were
on
the
station



scientists
study
the
germs

so
the
scientists
tried
something
different
they
studied
the
dna
of
the
germs
dna
is
part
of
every
living
thing
it
contains
the
instructions
for
how
each
<collocation>germ works</collocation>
looking
at
dna
helped
scientists
see
all
the
types
of
germs


the
scientists
looked
at
germs
from
two
places
one
type
came
from
the
air
of
the
<collocation>space station</collocation>
the
other
came
from
surfaces
surfaces
are
places
like
floors
and
<collocation>table tops</collocation>


most
of
the
germs
on
the
station
comes
from
human
skin
the
scientists
also
found
some
germs
that
could
make
<collocation>astronauts sick</collocation>



a
<collocation>healthy trip</collocation>
to
mars

astronauts
in
space
are
more
likely
to
get
sick
than
people
on
earth
said
<collocation>scientist kasthuri</collocation>
venkateswaran
he
was
in
charge
of
the
study
the
reason
is
because
the
air
in
space
is
very
different
from
earth


not
all
the
germs
make
people
sick
though
so
scientists
need
to
do
more
work
the
next
job
is
to
find
out
exactly
which
of
the
germs
are
dangerous
and
will
make
people
sick


nasa
may
want
to
send
astronauts
to
mars
someday
if
they
do
they
want
them
to
be
healthy
so
they
need
to
learn
more
about
<collocation>space germs</collocation>
