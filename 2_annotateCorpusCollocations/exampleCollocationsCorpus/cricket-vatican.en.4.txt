vatican
city
the
vatican
is
the
world
smallest
country
but
it
is
the
headquarters
of
the
roman
<collocation>catholic church</collocation>
on
tuesday
the
vatican
served
tea
and
cucumber
sandwiches
but
the
priests
weren
t
meeting
to
discuss
religion
they
were
there
to
announce
the
vatican
first
ever
cricket
team

pope
won
t
be
playing
the
game
himself
he
still
prefers
soccer
and
he
remains
a
fan
of
his
<collocation>beloved san</collocation>
<collocation>lorenzo club</collocation>


but
he
and
the
vatican
have
long
supported
sports
they
see
them
as
good
for
mind
body
and
soul
the
new
team
will
be
known
as
the
st
peter
<collocation>cricket club</collocation>


an
australian
<collocation>john mccarthy</collocation>
first
came
up
with
the
idea
he
hopes
the
new
team
will
play
the
church
of
england
<collocation>next fall</collocation>



interfaith
innings

mccarthy
said
the
idea
is
to
get
people
from
the
world
different
religions
talking
cricket
is
very
popular
in
india
pakistan
and
bangladesh
perhaps
someday
the
new
team
will
play
muslims
or
hindus
from
those
countries


and
mccarthy
added
there
was
another
reason
for
his
idea
he
wants
to
educate
italy
the
vatican
and
even
<collocation>pope francis</collocation>
about
something
there
is
a
sport
other
than
soccer


mccarthy
then
passed
around
cucumber
sandwiches
these
have
long
been
the
<collocation>favorite snack</collocation>
at
<collocation>cricket matches</collocation>


the
new
team
will
be
made
up
of
religious
students
and
priests
it
will
be
fielded
as
early
as
the
spring
rome
<collocation>capannelle cricket</collocation>
club
is
letting
the
vatican
use
its
playing
field


london
england
is
the
home
of
cricket
<collocation>adam chadwick</collocation>
of
lord
<collocation>cricket ground</collocation>
welcomed
the
new
vatican
team
and
he
seemed
open
to
a
vatican
versus
church
of
<collocation>england match</collocation>
this
he
said
could
be
played
on
one
of
lord
fields



a
sporting
soul

chadwick
admitted
that
people
think
of
cricket
as
a
game
played
only
by
the
rich
this
idea
he
said
dates
from
the
late
th
century
but
cricket
began
very
differently
the
game
was
originally
played
by
ordinary
people
not
by
noblemen


cricket
is
enormously
popular
in
places
like
india
the
game
caught
on
in
india
when
it
was
part
of
the
<collocation>british empire</collocation>
it
is
still
played
there
by
all
sorts
of
people


so
the
vatican
wasn
t
thinking
of
<collocation>rich englishmen</collocation>
it
is
interested
in
cricket
because
the
game
is
played
all
over
the
world
the
new
cricket
<collocation>team fits</collocation>
in
neatly
with
<collocation>pope francis</collocation>
aim
he
wants
the
church
to
reach
out
to
people
everywhere
and
he
wants
it
to
always
remember
the
poor


the
vatican
already
has
a
<collocation>soccer tournament</collocation>
this
is
known
as
the
clericus
cup
the
vatican
famed
swiss
<collocation>guards play</collocation>
<collocation>various teams</collocation>
made
up
of
religious
students


and
just
on
sunday
the
vatican
organized
a
race
of
faith
a
meter
foot
track
was
laid
down
it
ran
along
the
<collocation>main avenue</collocation>
leading
to
the
st
peter
square
st
peter
basilica
one
of
the
<collocation>largest churches</collocation>
in
the
world
is
located
there
the
idea
of
the
race
was
to
point
out
that
sports
are
important
even
for
religion
