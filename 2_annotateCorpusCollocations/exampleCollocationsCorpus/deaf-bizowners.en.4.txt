the

<collocation>deaf business</collocation>
owners

there
are
many
deaf
people
with
their
<collocation>own businesses</collocation>
hearing
people
are
not
used
to
it
they
<collocation>treat deaf</collocation>
people
differently
they
might
think
deaf
people
cannot
have
regular
jobs
they
might
think
deaf

should
only
work
with
other
deaf
people


the
steins
have
been
treated
unfairly
people
said
<collocation>unkind things</collocation>
to
them


some
people
made
fun
of
them
others
thought
the
steins
did
not
know
how
to
run
a
restaurant


the
steins
even
had
trouble
opening
their
restaurant
government
workers
did
not
want
to
give
them
permission



customers
are
willing
to
help

their
customers
are
happy
to
help
them
sometimes
customers
want
to
ask
a
question
they
are
willing
to
write
their
questions
on
paper
the
steins
will
read
the
questions
and
answer
them
some
customers
seem
uncomfortable
at
first
they
do
not
feel
comfortable
because
the
steins
cannot
hear
them
the
customers
soon
relax
though
then
they
enjoy
their
meals


they
are
no
longer
afraid
