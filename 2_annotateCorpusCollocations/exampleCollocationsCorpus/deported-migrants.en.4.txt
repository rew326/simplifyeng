room
in

city
is
a
pink
<collocation>drawer full</collocation>
of
her
<collocation>favorite possessions</collocation>
they
remind
her
of
a
life
that
slipping
away

are
<collocation>homecoming photos</collocation>
from
her
kansas
<collocation>high school</collocation>
and
a
<collocation>report card</collocation>
with
lots
of
a
and
then
there
a
taylor
<collocation>swift concert</collocation>
ticket



i
m
obsessed
with
taylor
swift
said
pinzon
who
known
by
her
friends
as
ali
she
recalled
how
her
best
friend
kristin
surprised
her
during
the
concert
with
a
<collocation>birthday message</collocation>
it
flashed
on
a
screen
behind
the
country
singer
happy
late
th
birthday
alibear


pinzon
made
a
tough
decision
just
months
after
seeing
swift
perform
in
she
went
back
to
mexico
her
choice
would
forever
shape
her
future



homesick
for
the
u
midwest

pinzon
was
then
and
living
in
the
united
states
illegally
her
father
had
taken
her
to
the
u
when
she
was
he
hoped
to
build
a
better
life
she
had
gone
to
schools
in
kansas
and
missouri


now
she
had
graduated
from
<collocation>high school</collocation>
she
wanted
to
go
to
college
but
knew
that
wasn
t
possible
most
likely
she
d
be
stuck
working
a
low
paying
job
she
might
get
deported
at
any
time


if
she
went
back
to
mexico
she
decided
she
d
be
able
to
get
her
degree
there
then
a
u
company
might
help
her
to
return
she
might
be
back
in
as
little
as
four
or
five
years


unfortunately
it
didn
t
work
out
that
way


pinzon
now
lives
in
mexico
city
but
her
heart
is
still
in
the
american
midwest
she
is
one
of
around
<collocation>young mexicans</collocation>
who
returned
to
their
homeland
from
to


on
aug
pinzon
stepped
off
a
plane
into
a
country
that
felt
foreign
to
her
even
though
it
was
her
<collocation>native land</collocation>
she
didn
t
know
when
she
d
be
back
in
the
u
again



i
felt
like
i
was
going
somewhere
where
i
had
never
been
before
she
said
i
didn
t
really
speak
a
lot
of
spanish



told
college
has
to
wait

most
of
pinzon
new
friends
in
mexico
also
recently
moved
from
the
u
she
doesn
t
have
to
worry
about
being
judged
by
them
when
she
speaks
english
until
she
found
them
she
felt
as
if
no
one
in
this
huge
city
understood
her
homesickness



in
my
mind
i
felt
like
i
was
the
only
one
who
knew
english
she
said
i
felt
like
i
was
the
only
one
who
was
going
through
this
situation
i
still
get
very
homesick
i
miss
my
friends
i
miss
everything


pinzon
could
have
gone
to
a
good
college
if
she
hadn
t
been
in
the
u
illegally
she
had
done
very
well
in
<collocation>high school</collocation>
she
dreamed
about
studying
journalism
or
<collocation>international relations</collocation>

returned
to
mexico
pinzon
tried
to
get
into
college
there
but
her
u
<collocation>high school</collocation>
records
weren
t
recognized
she
was
told
she
could
take
a
test
to
get
into
college
when
she
turned


she
ended
up
finding
a
low
paying
job
answering
the
phone
all
day



what
have
i
done


then
in
june
of
her
sister

would
no
longer
be
deported
from
the
united
states
if
pinzon
hadn
t
left
the
country
the
new
law
would
have
helped
her



what
have
i
done
pinzon
thought
to
herself
feeling
sick
to
her
stomach


she
should
have
just
waited

have
just
taken
me
two
years
the
two
years
i
ve
been
doing
this
i
could
have
been
doing
it
there


ali
