thirty
six
years
ago
the
spacecraft
voyager
took
off
from
earth
it
has
been
traveling
ever
since
it
was
on
its
way
to
leave
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
and
it
finally
made
it
it
is
now
the
first
spacecraft
to
enter
deep
<collocation>outer space</collocation>
or
<collocation>interstellar space</collocation>


nasa
said
on
thursday
that
voyager
left
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
but
it
actually
happened
more
than
a
year
ago
it
took
months
for
scientists
to
determine
that
the
spaceship
actually
got
to
<collocation>interstellar space</collocation>



voyager
has
boldly
gone
where
no
probe
has
gone
before
said
nasa
<collocation>john grunsfeld</collocation>
it
was
one
of
the
most
important
things
to
ever
happen
in
the
history
of
science
he
said


scientists
studied
something
called
space
<collocation>plasma density</collocation>
to
find
out
if
voyager
exited
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
nasa
said
this
is
a
measure
of
the
amount
of
very
small
pieces
found
in
gas
that
comes
from
our
sun
and
other
stars
those
small
pieces
or
particles
are
called
electrons



leaving
our
<collocation>space bubble</collocation>

scientists
explained
the
evidence
in
a
paper
it
was
published
online
thursday
in
the
journal
science


<collocation>don gurnett</collocation>
said
information
from
the
spacecraft
showed
that
voyager
had
left
the
heliopause
this
is
the
bubble
of
<collocation>hot pieces</collocation>
of
matter
that
surrounds
our
sun
and
planet


it
entered
into
a
region
of
cold
dark
space
the
region
is
called
the
<collocation>interstellar medium</collocation>
gurnett
is
an
<collocation>iowa state</collocation>
scientist
who
works
on
the
voyager
project
he
was
the
<collocation>main writer</collocation>
of
the
paper


gurnett
said
that
voyager
crossed
the
edge
of
the
heliosphere
around
aug
the
edge
of
the
heliosphere
is
called
the
heliopause


scientists
started
to
argue
about
where
voyager
was
earlier
this
year
they
could
tell
that
voyager
was
being
hit
by
more
and
more
cosmic
rays
the
number
of
<collocation>high energy</collocation>
pieces
from
inside
the
heliosphere
had
dropped
cosmic
rays
are
<collocation>tiny radiation</collocation>
pieces
that
hit
the
earth
from
space



mystery
about
<collocation>magnetic fields</collocation>

but
nasa
scientists
said
they
could
not
be
certain
voyager
had
left
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
they
had
to
see
evidence
that
<collocation>magnetic fields</collocation>
around
the
spacecraft
changed
direction
they
waited
for
that
change
for
more
than
a
year
then
officials
changed
their
mind
they
decided
that
the
<collocation>magnetic fields</collocation>
did
not
have
to
change
to
show
that
the
spacecraft
had
left
the
<collocation>solar system</collocation>
after
all



it
a
<collocation>big surprise</collocation>
and
it
another
mystery
said
ed
stone
a
voyager
project
scientist
at
caltech
this
is
not
what
our
models
were
telling
us
we
have
to
address
this
issue
but
right
now
we
don
t
understand


one
broken
piece
of
voyager
equipment
was
the
main
reason
for
the
confusion
it
is
called
the
<collocation>plasma science</collocation>
experiment
or
pls
the
device
takes
an
<collocation>important measurement</collocation>



it
was
supposed
to
show
if
voyager
had
reached
the
<collocation>cold plasma</collocation>
found
in
<collocation>interstellar space</collocation>
it
broke
in


but
voyager
does
have
two
antennas
they
stretch
from
its
base
in
a
wide
<collocation>v shape</collocation>
the
antennas
can
tell
how
fast
space
<collocation>plasma particles</collocation>
bounce
around
or
vibrate
they
turn
those
vibrations
into
noise
the
vibrations
also
can
show
if
voyager
is
traveling
through
the
<collocation>cold plasma</collocation>
of
<collocation>interstellar space</collocation>



<collocation>recording space</collocation>
noise

the
noise
is
recorded
on
voyager
<collocation>sound equipment</collocation>
there
were
no
ipods
years
ago
the
spacecraft
uses
eight
track
tape
recorders


but
something
has
to
make
the
plasma
vibrates
first
the
something
can
be
a
large
solar
flare
waiting
for
a
solar
flare
can
take
years


then
it
can
take
as
long
as
a
year
for
the
flare
shock
wave
to
reach
voyager
the
spacecraft
is
billion
miles
away
from
the
sun


fortunately
for
voyager
scientists
the
antennas
picked
up
two
long
lasting
vibrations
the
first
was
in
the
second
was
in
both
cases
suggested
that
the
plasma
was
cold
and
dense
voyager
was
in
<collocation>interstellar space</collocation>



it
was
<collocation>key evidence</collocation>
stone
said
we
really
needed
to
<collocation>measure plasma</collocation>
to
know
if
we
were
inside
or
outside
the
heliosphere



voyager
heads
toward
<collocation>deep space</collocation>

scientists
hope
that
voyager
will
answer
a
lot
of
questions
the
spacecraft
was
also
launched
in
it
is
near
the
edge
of
the
heliosphere
it
is
traveling
a
different
path
voyager
is
expected
to
<collocation>reach interstellar</collocation>
space
sometime
within
the
next
several
years


voyager
has
a
working
<collocation>plasma science</collocation>
instrument



i
think
it
going
to
teach
us
even
more
about
this
region
