on
the
boat

two
months
ago
the
<collocation>mardini sisters</collocation>
also
left
their
country
they
got
on
a
boat
carrying
refugees
to
greece
there
were
too
many
people
on
the
boat
the
boat
was
sinking


when
the
sea
turned
rough
people
threw
their
bags
into
the
water
they
thought
it
would
make
the
<collocation>boat lighter</collocation>
it
did
not
work
most
of
the
people
could
not
swim
ysra
sarah
and
three
other
<collocation>good swimmers</collocation>
jumped
into
the
water
they
thought
it
would
keep
the
boat
from
sinking


there
were
ropes
hanging
from
the
side
of
the
boat
for
three
hours
the
sisters
held
on
to
the
ropes
finally
the
boat
landed
in
greece
then
they
began
to
walk
after
many
weeks
they
made
it
to
germany
soon
after
getting
to
germany
they
joined
a
swimming
club
the
club
helped
them
get
into
a
training
program

the
government
