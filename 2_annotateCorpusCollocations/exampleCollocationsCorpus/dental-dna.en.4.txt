clues
about
how
people
lived
can
be
found
in
their
teeth


a
new
study
looks
at
the
teeth
of
people
who
lived
years
ago
scientists
examined
their
skeletons
their
teeth
held
a
huge
amount
of
information
this
information
may
help
scientists
know
what
they
ate
the
scientists
also
will
learn
what
diseases
they
had


<collocation>christina warinner</collocation>
is
a
scientist
at
the
university
of
oklahoma
she
said
that
the
teeth
were
like
a
window
into
the
past



this
is
a
<collocation>game changer</collocation>
she
said



<collocation>tooth plaque</collocation>
tested

the
scientists
studied
the
plaque
on
the
ancient
teeth
plaque
is
the
rough
<collocation>bumpy stuff</collocation>
that
covers
your
teeth
you
get
it
if
you
don
t
brush
enough
today
dentists
<collocation>scrape plaque</collocation>
off
our
teeth
this
is
part
of
our
regular
<collocation>teeth cleaning</collocation>


if
plaque
isn
t
scraped
off
it
grows
thick
the
plaque
can
get
thicker
than
the
tooth
itself
this
is
what
happened
to
the
skeletons
they
didn
t
have
dentists
like
we
do
today


the
plaque
trapped
bacteria
on
the
skeletons
teeth
the
bacteria
turned
into
small
fossils
bacteria
also
live
in
our
<collocation>mouths today</collocation>


warinner
scraped
the
plaque
off
teeth
the
teeth
came
from
four
people
they
lived
years
ago
in
germany
warinner
treated
the
plaque
with
chemicals
then
she
put
the
plaque
through
a
machine
the
machine
separates
out
the
dna
dna
holds
the
information
that
tells
all
living
things
how
to
grow
and
work
every
creature
dna
is
different



what
scientists
found

the
result
was
thrilling
she
said


it
hard
for
scientists
to
get
much
dna
from
bones
they
found
much
more
dna
in
the
<collocation>tooth plaque</collocation>
much
of
the
dna
came
from
bacteria
this
<collocation>bacteria causes</collocation>
cavities


scientists
discovered
that
bacteria
has
not
changed
much
in
years
they
also
found
bits
of
<collocation>plant dna</collocation>
in
the
teeth
this
shows
what
people
ate
years
ago


everyone
in
history
has
had
<collocation>tooth plaque</collocation>
so
teeth
could
teach
us
about
people
who
lived
long
ago
