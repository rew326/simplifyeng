washington
in
the
united
states
ended
its
friendship
cuba


on
wednesday
the
united
states
said
the
two
countries
will
begin
fixing
their
relationship


cuba
is
an
island
less
than
miles
from
florida
the
united
states
cut
off
contact
two
years
after
<collocation>communist leader</collocation>
<collocation>fidel castro</collocation>
grabbed
power
castro
said
communism
would
make
<collocation>everyone equal</collocation>
in
reality
there
is
little
freedom


at
the
time
the
u
government
worried
about
a
communist
country
so
close
to
america
it
did
not
want
communism
spreading
to
the
united
states



an
american
is
set
free

the
news
of
beginning
to
talk
again
comes
after
the
release
of
<collocation>alan gross</collocation>
from
a
cuban
jail
gross
is
an
american
who
has
been
in
a
cuban
jail
for
five
years
cuba
said
he
brought
cellphones
and
computers
into
cuba
which
is
against
the
law


gross
who
is
years
old
has
already
been
sent
home
cuba
and
the
united
states
spoke
secretly
for
a
year
about
freeing
him


gross
family
in
maryland
said
he
is
in
bad
health
he
is
weak
and
can
barely
walk
in
cuba
he
had
refused
<collocation>medical care</collocation>
food
and
visits
from
american
officials
he
was
protesting
being
kept
in
jail


the
united
states
made
a
deal
with
cuba
gross
will
be
released
in
exchange
the
united
states
will
free
three
cubans
the
cubans
were
arrested
in
for
spying
they
were
asked
to
spy
on
anti
castro
groups
in
florida
the
state
is
home
to
many
cubans
who
came
to
the
united
states
because
they
did
not
like
castro



change
can
be
good

the
united
states
plans
to
send
an
ambassador
to
cuba
the
ambassador
would
be
the
official
u
representative
in
cuba
countries
with
<collocation>normal relations</collocation>
exchange
ambassadors


the
united
states
will
also
start
talks
on
other
things
that
divide
the
two
nations
under
law
american
companies
cannot
do
business
with
cuba
they
also
cannot
sell
american
products
there
travel
to
cuba
is
also
limited
lawmakers
passed
a
trade
and
<collocation>travel ban</collocation>
they
wanted
to
pressure
cuba
to
<collocation>end communism</collocation>


this
will
create
a
force
for
positive
change
said
dick
durbin
he
is
a
lawmaker
from
illinois
ignoring
cuba
did
<collocation>nothing positive</collocation>
durbin
said


legally
only
congress
can
end
the
<collocation>trade ban</collocation>
on
cuba
president
obama
can
use
his
powers
as
president
to
help
though
he
can
try
to
begin
a
<collocation>normal relationship</collocation>
enemies
of
castro
are
likely
to
oppose
it
florida
lawmakers
are
also
likely
to
object



the
countries
are
ready
to
talk

for
many
years
speaking
with
cuba
would
have
been
unpopular
for
a
president
experts
say
it
is
safer
now
times
have
changed
many
in
the
cuban
american
<collocation>immigrant community</collocation>
do
not
feel
as
strongly
about
it
also
it
seems
that
the
<collocation>trade ban</collocation>
has
not
achieved
its
goal
communism
is
as
strong
as
ever
in
cuba


no
top
u
official
believes
the
<collocation>trade ban</collocation>
will
make
cuba
more
free
said
gregory
b
craig
he
used
to
be
a
<collocation>white house</collocation>
lawyer


originally
five
<collocation>cuban spies</collocation>
were
caught
in
two
of
the
five
already
finished
serving
their
jail
time
and
returned
home
in
cuba
they
are
called
heroes
and
freedom
fighters
cuba
says
they
were
unfairly
put
in
jail
by
the
united
states


cuba
has
not
yet
released
its
thoughts
cuban
<collocation>president raul</collocation>
castro
will
speak
soon
about
the
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
cuba
he
is
the
brother
of
<collocation>fidel castro</collocation>
who
is
very
sick
