<collocation>jennifer kavanaugh</collocation>
has
been
a
teacher
for
years
during
that
time
she
never
dreamed
of
hitting
a
child
not
even
once


kavanaugh
is
now
a
<collocation>fifth grade</collocation>
teacher
she
teaches
at
st
margaret
of
<collocation>scotland school</collocation>
in
st
louis


she
used
to
teach
at
a
school
where
<collocation>corporal punishment</collocation>
was
used
that
means
kids
who
misbehaved
were
punished
with
a
spanking


kavanaugh
never
used
<collocation>corporal punishment</collocation>
herself
but
she
knows
there
are
teachers
across
the
state
who
do
she
wants
it
stopped


<collocation>corporal punishment</collocation>
does
not
work
she
said
it
does
not
make
for
a
more
peaceful
<collocation>happier child</collocation>



already
banned
in
some
districts

recently
kavanaugh
and
about
of
her
<collocation>fifth grade</collocation>
students
attended
a
meeting
it
had
been
called
to
discuss
a
bill
that
would
outlaw
school
spankings
in
missouri
a
bill
is
sort
of
a
test
run
for
a
new
law
if
it
passes
a
vote
it
becomes
a
real
law
this
<collocation>particular bill</collocation>
was
introduced
by
<collocation>state senator</collocation>
joe
keaveny



we
need
to
stop
hitting
our
kids
keaveny
said


missouri
is
one
of
states
that
still
allows
spanking
in
schools
the
latest
states
to
outlaw
it
were
new
mexico
in
and
ohio
in


many
missouri
<collocation>school districts</collocation>
still
allow
spanking
in
at
least
did
a
<collocation>school district</collocation>
usually
contains
at
least
several
schools
so
that
a
lot
of
schools


however
many
districts
in
the
st
<collocation>louis area</collocation>
do
not
permit
it
these
include
st
louis
itself
clayton
lindbergh
and
riverview
gardens


the
ferguson
florissant
district
does
not
allow
it
either
<collocation>district officials</collocation>
believe
there
are
better
ways
to
react
to
<collocation>bad behavior</collocation>
they
range
from
calling
in
parents
to
suspending
or
expelling
students


but
some
districts
do
allow
the
practice
about
students
across
the
state
were
spanked
or
physically
punished
in
the
school
year


the
<collocation>fox school</collocation>
district
in
jefferson
county
used
to
allow
spanking
in
the
early
however
it
changed
its
rules


the
district
no
longer
sees
it
as
a
<collocation>proper way</collocation>
to
punish
kids
<collocation>district official</collocation>
lorenzo
rizzi
said
spanking
doesn
t
change
behavior
he
said
often
it
just
makes
things
worse



bill
includes
<collocation>private schools</collocation>

the
move
away
from
spanking
is
happening
across
the
country
during
the
school
year
about
students
were
physically
punished
four
years
earlier
the
number
was
greater
about
students


a
decrease
however
is
not
enough
for
kavanaugh
she
wants
to
see
<collocation>teachers switch</collocation>
their
<collocation>whole approach</collocation>
she
thinks
they
should
be
rewarding
students
for
good
behavior
that
she
thinks
works
better
than
punishing
them
for
<collocation>bad behavior</collocation>



we
need
to
ask
more
of
teachers
she
said


no
one
spoke
against
the
bill
at
wednesday
meeting
however
<collocation>state senator</collocation>
gina
walsh
has
problems
with
it
she
thinks
including
<collocation>private schools</collocation>
in
the
bill
is
a
bad
idea
walsh
attended
catholic
school
as
a
child



i
do
not
<collocation>support corporal</collocation>
punishment
she
said
but
my
parents
sent
me
to
a
faith
based
school
i
m
opposed
to
government
telling
such
schools
what
to
do


<collocation>state senator</collocation>
jolie
<collocation>justus supports</collocation>
the
bill
still
she
agrees
there
could
be
a
problem
when
it
comes
to
<collocation>private schools</collocation>



i
suspect
we
ll
hear
from
people
who
don
t
want
the
state
interfering
in
<collocation>private schools</collocation>
justus
said
at
some
point
we
may
need
to
make
some
changes
right
now
i
haven
t
heard
from
anyone
who
against
it
