about
babies
are
born
every
year
in
the
united
states
with
half
a
heart
it
is
a
rare
but
serious
problem
known
as
hlhs
the
babies
must
have
three
<collocation>major operations</collocation>
even
after
the
operations
there
is
a
chance
their
hearts
will
stop
working
way
too
soon


a
famous
hospital
called
the
<collocation>mayo clinic</collocation>
is
trying
something
new
doctors
there
want
to
see
to
see
if
a
certain
type
of
cell
can
be
used
to
strengthen
the
hearts


doctors
hope
that
using
these
special
cells
can
make
the
<collocation>hearts strong</collocation>
enough
so
the
babies
can
grow
up
and
live
longer
the
cells
are
called
<collocation>stem cells</collocation>
doctors
retrieve
them
from
the
cord
that
connected
the
babies
to
their
mothers
just
after
birth


<collocation>christina deshaw</collocation>
had
a
<collocation>baby daughter</collocation>
named
<collocation>ava grace</collocation>
before
ava
was
born
her
parents
found
out
that
the
left
side
of
her
heart
was
not
growing
properly



<collocation>baby ava</collocation>
grace


the
world
just
started
spinning
deshaw
said
our
lives
were
forever
changed
from
the
moment
she
and
her
husband
found
out


deshaw
and
her
husband
went
to
the
mayo
for
help


children
with
problems
on
the
left
side
of
the
heart
must
have
three
<collocation>difficult operations</collocation>
the
first
comes
days
after
they
are
born
doctors
rebuild
the
heart
they
make
it
so
that
the
right
side
does
the
work
of
both
sides
of
the
heart


the
operation
is
dangerous
many
babies
did
not
survive
it
in
the
past
but
more
are
living
through
it
now


the
second
and
<collocation>third operations</collocation>
are
much
safer
doctors
change
how
the
<collocation>blood runs</collocation>
through
the
body
they
make
it
go
straight
to
the
lungs
this
makes
the
heart
have
to
work
less



help
all
the
<collocation>other babies</collocation>


<collocation>ava grace</collocation>
was
born
on
may
her
heart
was
the
size
of
a
walnut
deshaw
said
she
was
taken
quickly
to
her
first
operation


ava
stayed
at
the
hospital
until
september
but
she
has
had
many
problems
since
she
went
home
she
even
went
back
to
mayo
in
a
helicopter
once


but
she
won
t
be
able
to
be
part
of
the
study
the
<collocation>stem cells</collocation>
get
put
into
the
heart
during
the
<collocation>second operation</collocation>
she
has
already
had
her
<collocation>second operation</collocation>
and
missed
the
chance


still
ava
parents
want
to
help
mayo
study
and
not
just
because
of
ava
we
also
wanted
to
help
all
the
<collocation>other babies</collocation>
deshaw
said



making
<collocation>cells work</collocation>
better

doctors
at
mayo
found
that
<collocation>stem cells</collocation>
get
weaker
as
they
get
older
they
seem
to
get
sick
along
with
the
patient
mayo
just
finished
a
test
in
europe
it
showed
that
they
could
make
the
<collocation>cells work</collocation>
better


dr
timothy
nelson
is
working
on
the
new
treatment
he
is
trying
to
<collocation>cure hlhs</collocation>
hypoplastic
left
heart
syndrome
he
thinks
that
the
<collocation>stem cells</collocation>
used
in
the
new
test
and
put
into
a
growing
heart
will
work
even
better
than
the
ones
used
in
europe


nelson
decided
he
wanted
to
find
a
cure
for
hlhs
when
he
was
studying
to
become
a
<collocation>heart surgeon</collocation>
for
children
it
made
him
sad
that
babies
had
to
have
three
<collocation>dangerous surgeries</collocation>
and
would
often
come
back
as
young
children
with
<collocation>sick hearts</collocation>
then
the
children
usually
could
not
find
a
new
heart
in
time
to
save
them



research
could
help
sooner

joshua
and
sandra
hughes
said
they
learned
about
mayo
children
heart
study
from
a
friend
their
year
old
daughter
jaclyn
also
has
hlhs


jaclyn
had
a
body
scan
taken
<collocation>last week</collocation>
a
doctor
said
jaclyn
heart
is
working
well
after
her
<collocation>third operation</collocation>



the
stuff
they
re
working
on
now
may
not
be
available
for
jackie
sandra
hughes
said
but
it
may
be
available
for
the
next
generation


the
<collocation>doctor interrupted</collocation>
her
he
thinks
the
research
may
help
a
lot
sooner



it
may
be
available
for
her
too
he
said
