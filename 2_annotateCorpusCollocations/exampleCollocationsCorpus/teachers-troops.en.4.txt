what
did
your
teachers
do
before
they
were
teachers
maybe
they
flew
<collocation>black hawk</collocation>
helicopters
or
they
could
have
served
on
submarines
or
maybe
they
trained
soldiers
to
<collocation>use stinger</collocation>
missiles
to
shoot
down
<collocation>enemy jets</collocation>
and
helicopters


more
than
people
who
served
in
the
military
have
become
teachers
they
are
part
of
a
military
program
called
troops
to
teachers
that
helps
<collocation>turn veterans</collocation>
into
teachers


the
idea
is
that
they
already
know
how
to
lead
they
also
learned
other
things
in
the
military
that
could
be
used
in
a
classroom
most
teach
in
schools
where
there
is
a
big
need
for
teachers



a
lot
of
times
kids
want
to
test
me
because
i
was
in
the
military
said
<collocation>anthony kajencki</collocation>

is
a
<collocation>former army</collocation>
<collocation>air defense</collocation>

k


kajencki
is
and
known
to
his
students
as
captain
k

<collocation>west point</collocation>
and
in
the
army
he
learned
how
to
take
whatever
was
thrown
at
him
and
carry
on



he
tries
to
pass
that
on
to
his
students
well
that
and
what
it
like
to
jump
out
of
a
plane


people
in
the
program
who
agree
to
work
in
schools
that
serve
low
income
high
needs
students
can
get
a
bonus


kajencki
spent
more
than
seven
years
in
the
army
he
trained
soldiers
to
use
missiles
to
shoot
down
<collocation>enemy aircraft</collocation>
he
also
was
on
the
staff
for
a
commanding
general
in
bosnia


he
left
the
military
in
to
become
a
teacher
but
he
ended
up
working
in
large
stores
instead
in
he
looked
into
the
troops
to
teachers
program
<collocation>duke university</collocation>
also
gave
him
the
chance
to
earn
an
advanced
degree
in
education
kajencki
agreed
to
teach
at
a
poor
school
in
return



to
help
people
succeed



i
feel
i
have
the
ability
to
help
people
succeed
kajencki

that
in
the
army

it
in
retail

m
doing
it
in
education
that
something
that
has
given
me
a
lot
of
joy


<collocation>john helton</collocation>
is
a
year
old
retired
<collocation>coast guard</collocation>
commander
he
teaches
an
all
boys
class
of
fifth
graders
in
<collocation>south carolina</collocation>
the
students
love
to
hear
stories
from
his
year
career
he
tells
about
rescues
at
sea
and
being
on
submarines
deep
under
water


that
is
what
gets
students
to
listen
he
said
kids
want
to
hear
someone
who
is
excited
about
it
and
has
something
to
say
and
really
cares
about
them
he
said

helton
enlisted
in
the
navy
he
served
for
more
than
years
on
submarines


then
he
spent
years
as
a
<collocation>coast guard</collocation>
engineer
the
career
took
him
to
ports
from
maine
to
the
midwest
as
well
as
puerto
rico



pretty
much
everything
i
teach
i
have
a
story
helton
said



from
helicopter
to
classroom

helton
worked
very
long
days
in
his
first
year
teaching
last
year


he
grew
up
without
a
father
around
most
of
the
time
just
like
a
lot
of
his
students
he
lived
on
welfare
and
didn
t
have
somebody
to
guide
him
this
is
why
he
got
involved
in
troops
to
teachers
after
he
retired
from
the
<collocation>coast guard</collocation>
in


brandon
phillips
<collocation>military career</collocation>
is
also
something
he
talks
about
occasionally
in
his
<collocation>fourth grade</collocation>
class


when
he
teaches
math
to
his
fourth
graders
in
springfield
ga
he
might
say
i
had
to
know
how
to
do
that
when
we
would
<collocation>fly missions</collocation>
in
iraq
<collocation>pilots need</collocation>
to
know
how
to
do
this


phillips
was
the
<collocation>black hawk</collocation>
<collocation>flight leader</collocation>
on
missions
in
iraq
and
afghanistan
he
had
to
plan
with
his
team
manage
the
work
and
keep
everybody
doing
what
was
necessary
to
complete
the
mission


in
some
ways
his
classroom
is
no
different



there
always
<collocation>multiple things</collocation>
going
on
phillips
said
different
people
have
different
needs
my
brain
is
just
wired
to
be
able
to
respond
to
that
without
getting
too
stressed
out
