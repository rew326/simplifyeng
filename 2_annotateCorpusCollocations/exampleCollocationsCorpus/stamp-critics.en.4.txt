<collocation>traditional stamp</collocation>
collectors
do
not
like
<collocation>harry potter</collocation>
and
bugs
bunny
at
least
not
on
their
stamps


some
<collocation>stamp collectors</collocation>
have
a
problem
with
newer
u
stamps
they
say
the
committee
that
picks
the
stamps
is
focusing
on
the
wrong
things
pop
stars
and
<collocation>fictional characters</collocation>
fewer
and
fewer
stamps
picture
important
people
and
events
from
<collocation>american history</collocation>


they
say
stamps
used
to
celebrate
important
people
and
events
but
things
are
changing



who
gets
to
be
on
a
stamp


<collocation>ken martin</collocation>
is
head
of
the
<collocation>american philatelic</collocation>
society
the
group
is
made
up
of
<collocation>stamp collectors</collocation>
martin
is
not
at
all
happy
with
the
new
stamps



<collocation>harry potter</collocation>
is
a
<collocation>perfect example</collocation>
martin
said
he
is
not
pleased
to
see
a
stamp
honoring
the
<collocation>fictional boy</collocation>
wizard
he
pointed
out
that
harry
creator
j
k
rowling
is
british



why
do
you
honor
a
british
author
book
martin
asked
wouldn
t
it
be
much
better
to
honor
something
that
reflects
our
country
history


many
say
that
the
reason
for
the
change
is
money
after
all
money
is
something
the
<collocation>postal service</collocation>
badly
needs
it
has
been
losing
a
lot
of
money
for
some
time


the
<collocation>newer kinds</collocation>
of
stamps
sell
very
well
they
sell
much
better
than
<collocation>traditional stamps</collocation>
these
might
have
pictures
of
flowers
on
them


pictures
of
say
<collocation>civil war</collocation>
generals
just
are
not
that
popular
stamps
celebrating
things
like
spider
man
or
<collocation>star wars</collocation>
are
not
surprisingly
the
<collocation>postal service</collocation>
is
focusing
on
stamps
that
people
will
want
to
buy



a
<collocation>postage home</collocation>
run

the
<collocation>postal service</collocation>
certainly
came
up
with
a
hit
last
november
its
<collocation>harry potter</collocation>
stamps


the
stamps
<collocation>show scenes</collocation>
from
some
of
the
eight
wildly
popular
<collocation>harry potter</collocation>
movies
one
shows
<collocation>harry reading</collocation>
the
letter
admitting
him
to
hogwarts
hogwarts
of
course
is
a
school
for
<collocation>young witches</collocation>
and
wizards


various
magical
creatures
are
also
featured
among
them
are
dobby
the
<collocation>house elf</collocation>
and
hedwig
the
owl


postal
officials
don
t
feel
the
need
to
apologize
for
the
new
stamps
they
hope
the
stamps
will
make
young
people
interested
in
stamp
collecting


toni
delancey
is
a
<collocation>postal service</collocation>
spokeswoman
according
to
her

it
has
to
serve
the
changing
needs
of
the
american
public
when
it
comes
to

are
probably
the
kind
they
want
to
see
she
said


delancey
defended
the
member
committee
that
<collocation>picks future</collocation>
stamps
the
committee
is
just
keeping
up
with
the
times
she
said



stamps
celebrate
lots
of
things

not
everyone
agrees
last
month
one
member
of
the
committee
angrily
quit


the
member
who
quit
is
benjamin
bailar
he
served
as
head
of
the
<collocation>postal service</collocation>
during
the
he
suggested
that
the
committee
be
ended
the
only
purpose
of
the
new
stamps
he
said
was
to
make
more
money


bailar
wrote
that
stamps
should
celebrate
the
things
that
are
great
about
the
united
states
the
committee
shouldn
t
be
picking
comic
strip
characters
and
pop
music
characters


janet
klug
is
head
of
the
<collocation>stamp committee</collocation>
she
said
she
was
disappointed
by
bailar
resignation
she
does
not
think
he
represents
others
in
the
group
the
committee
goal
she
said
is
to
<collocation>increase interest</collocation>
in
stamp
collecting



i
don
t
even
know
if
the
<collocation>post office</collocation>
is
making
more
money
she
said
i
m
sure
they
would
like
to
make
more
money
who
wouldn
t
but
it
also
trying
to
reach
a
<collocation>broader public</collocation>
and
get
them
interested
in
stamps
