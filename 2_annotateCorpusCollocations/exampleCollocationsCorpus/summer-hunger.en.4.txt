wants
poor

to
get
money
for
food
during
the
summer
too
she
said
many
<collocation>poor children</collocation>
do
not
get

at
that
time



let
all
eat
potatoes

under

would
get
to
buy

for
her
children
during
the
summer
that
for
each

murray
said
her
plan
would
help
million
children


murray

wants
poor

to
get
to
eat
more
<collocation>white potatoes</collocation>
<collocation>white potatoes</collocation>
are
a
big
crop
in
her
state
washington

think

tag
school
lunch
but
agreeing
on
what
to
do
will
be
hard



toss
in
more
fruits
and
vegetables

many
lawmakers
worry
that
the
school
lunch
program
already
costs
too
much
and
they
fear
it
will
soon
cost
even
more


now
schools
must
offer
more
fruits
and
vegetables
whole
wheat
products
and
low
sodium
foods
that
is
because
of
new
rules
that
are
backed
by
first
<collocation>lady michelle</collocation>
obama


some
people
say
it
a
mistake
to
make
schools
offer
food
that
many
students
do
not
want
to
eat
they
say
more
food
will
be
thrown
out
they
also
say
fewer
students
will
eat
the
meals



less
kids
are
buying
school
lunches
said
<collocation>lawmaker robert</collocation>
aderholt
of
alabama
he
said
it
was
time
to
to
hit
the
pause
button
on
new
guidelines


aderholt
and
other
lawmakers
said
schools
that
cannot
afford
to
serve
healthier
school
lunches
should
not
have
to
meanwhile
the
government
said
schools
can
serve
<collocation>regular pasta</collocation>
instead
of
whole
grain
pasta
for
another
two
years



helping
children
to
eat
should
be
no
brainer

school
lunches
are
a
controversial
topic
in
december
<collocation>lawmaker jack</collocation>
kingston
of
georgia
suggested
that
schoolchildren
could
sweep
the
floors
before
getting
free
lunches
many
people
loudly
disagreed


<collocation>patty murray</collocation>
said
she
was
ready
for
questions
about
the
cost
of
her
<collocation>summer hunger</collocation>
program
but
she
is
expecting
support
for
it
from
other
lawmakers


edwards
the
mother
of
four
is
hoping
lawmakers
will
support
the
idea
the
extra
money
would
help
her
feed
her
children
she
said
everything
is
getting
more
expensive



my
water
bill
is
a
month
my
gas
bill
is
a
month
my
<collocation>electricity bill</collocation>
is
a
month
edwards
said


she
is
also
worried
about
the
rising
cost
of
meat
<collocation>last week</collocation>
she
paid
more
than
for
<collocation>ground beef</collocation>
and
bacon
at
the
<collocation>grocery store</collocation>
her
food
stamps
do
not
cover
the
cost
of
meals
she
said
