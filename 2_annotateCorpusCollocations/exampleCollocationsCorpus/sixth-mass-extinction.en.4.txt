in
earth
history
there
have
been
five
moments
when
much
of
the
planet
life
has
died
they
were
<collocation>mass extinctions</collocation>
<collocation>natural events</collocation>
caused
the
first
five
an
asteroid
killed
the
dinosaurs
volcanoes
may
have
caused
the
great
dying
it
wiped
out
nearly
everything
on
land
or
sea


altogether
the
five
<collocation>mass extinctions</collocation>
killed
off
three
quarters
of
the
planet
life
the
<collocation>sixth mass</collocation>
extinction
may
now
be
starting
this
time
it
isn
t
nature
fault
it
is
ours


for
hundreds
of
years
we
have
burned
fossil
fuels
like
oil
coal
and
natural
gas
it
changed
the
climate
humans
use
more
than
half
of
the
planet
land
for
cities
wood
or
food
our
actions
destroyed
the
<collocation>natural environment</collocation>
of
animals
and
plants



hunting
too
many
animals

humans
have
existed
for
years
on
earth
scientists
say
we
have
made
about
<collocation>species extinct</collocation>
early
humans
hunted
the
biggest
animals
like
woolly
mammoths
<collocation>giant kangaroos</collocation>
and
<collocation>giant sloths</collocation>
we
drove
them
to
extinction
since
the
year
we
have
killed
off
at
least
types
of
animals
the
passenger
pigeon
and
the
tasmanian
tiger
are
all
gone
most
recently
a
freshwater
dolphin
in
china
called
the
baiji
was
wiped
out


five
million
animal
species
are
left
on
the
planet
about
one
third
of
them
are
either
threatened
or
endangered
says
a
new
study
in
<collocation>science magazine</collocation>


scientists
aren
t
sure
how
quickly
it
happening
maybe
that
because
<collocation>tiny insects</collocation>
are
most
of
what
dying
out
the
study
in
science
says
their
numbers
fell
by
half
in
just
the
past
years
at
the
same
time
humans
have
doubled
in
population
other
studies
say
species
are
becoming
extinct
times
faster
than
usual


the
biggest
animals
like
elephants
tigers
and
whales
are
in
the
most
danger



to
the
rescue


it
not
too
late
humans
have
already
rescued
some
species
the
black
footed
ferret
was
brought
back
from
just
seven
left
condors
have
been
nursed
back
through
medicine
and
raised
by
hand
another
new
study
in
science
said
that
people
have
moved
species
of
plants
and
animals
to
protect
them
from
extinction


fishes
can
bounce
back
when
we
stop
overfishing
salmon
in
<collocation>washington state</collocation>
already
have
when
we
stop
farming
too
much
woods
grow
back
then
coyotes
deer
turkey
and
other
<collocation>wildlife return</collocation>
animals
and
plants
in
the
<collocation>amazon rain</collocation>
forest
do
better
now
that
<collocation>brazil cuts</collocation>
down
<collocation>fewer trees</collocation>
there


we
could
learn
from
india
scientists
say
that
out
of
<collocation>large mammals</collocation>
in
india
have
survived
leopards
and
deer
are
among
them
for
the
past
years
they
ve
lived
alongside
humans



people
can
still
<collocation>change course</collocation>

our
climate
is
changing
<collocation>endangered species</collocation>
could
be
moved
to
save
them
species
like
wolves
or
beavers
have
left
their
<collocation>old ecosystems</collocation>
they
could
be
brought
back
some
species
have
entered
new
areas
and
caused
problems
<collocation>asian carp</collocation>
have
invaded
lakes
in
the
u
eating
everything
they
may
need
to
be
killed
to
save
other
plants
and
animals


in
some
cases
new
animals
could
be
brought
in
they
could
replace
extinct
animals
for
example
<collocation>european sailors</collocation>
ate
their
way
through
the
<collocation>indian ocean</collocation>
islands
of
mauritius
they
killed
off
the
dodo
bird
and
<collocation>local turtles</collocation>
but
turtles
nearby
have
been
brought
in
they
helped
bring
back
the
<collocation>island ecosystem</collocation>


there
is
even
some
hope
of
bringing
back
<collocation>extinct species</collocation>
in
the
future
biology
and
genetics
could
make
it
possible
yet
bringing
back
<collocation>extinct species</collocation>
could
cause
problems
for
ones
now
it
could
be
like
the
<collocation>asian carp</collocation>
problem
we
have
to
be
careful


but
a
<collocation>sixth mass</collocation>
extinction
can
be
avoided
a
study
in
<collocation>nature magazine</collocation>
in
said
we
have
to
years
before
we
might
cause
a
<collocation>mass extinction</collocation>
unlike
an
asteroid
we
can
<collocation>change course</collocation>
