the
two
men
were
cavers
they
liked
finding
out
what
was
inside
caves
in
september
they
decided
to
head
inside
a
cave
in
<collocation>south africa</collocation>
the
cave
is
one
of
a
group
of
caves
known
as
rising
star


the
men
were
looking
for
a
space
deep
underground
such
a
space
is
known
as
a
chamber
it
is
something
like
a
big
room
hidden
inside
a
cave
no
one
had
ever
been
inside
this
chamber



looking
for
<collocation>old bones</collocation>

most
people
believed
there
were
no
more
treasures
inside
the
cave
american
<collocation>scientist lee</collocation>
berger
did
not
think
that
was
true
he
asked
the
men
to
keep
their
eyes
open
for
<collocation>old bones</collocation>


to
get
to
the
chamber
the
men
had
to
climb
and
crawl
through
the
dark
then
they
had
to
wriggle
sideways
through
a
narrow
crack
for
feet


at
last
the
men
reached
the
hidden
chamber
they
dropped
down
and
entered
it



different
from
<collocation>human bones</collocation>

what
they
found
amazed
them
the
chamber
contained
more
than
bones
and
teeth
the
bones
were
strange
they
almost
looked
like
a
human
bones
but
were
different


the
men
told
berger
what
they
had
found
berger
knew
it
was
something
really
big
for
a
<collocation>month digging</collocation>
continued
inside
the
chamber
everything
that
was
dug
up
was
carefully
studied



more
than
million
years
old

on
<collocation>thursday berger</collocation>
was
finally
ready
to
announce
what
had
been
found
the
bones
are
more
than
million
years
old
he
said
they
belonged
to
a
kind
of
animal
no
one
has
ever
seen
before
the
animal
came
before
humans
but
is
related
to
humans
it
was
like
a
human
but
had
a
smaller
brain


scientists
have
named
the
newly
found
<collocation>animal homo</collocation>
naledi
naledi
is
an
african
word
that
means
star
the
word
was
picked
because
of
the
name
of
the
caves
homo
is
the
<collocation>latin word</collocation>
for
man



they
walked
and
swung
from
trees

homo
naledi
fingers
were
long
and
curved
this
allowed
it
to
climb
and
swing
from
trees
its
shoulders
and
chest
were
like
those
of
an
ape
the
animal
had
long
legs
and
feet
like
a
person
though
it
was
able
to
<collocation>walk standing</collocation>
up
berger
said
homo
naledi
could
also
use
tools


berger
and
his
team
plan
to
return
to
the
chamber



this
chamber
has
not
given
up
all
its
secrets
he
said
