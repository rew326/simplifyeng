calif
it
a
friday
night
high
in
the
snow
peaked
<collocation>eastern sierra</collocation>
mountains
a
pack
of
huskies
is
howling


drawn
by
their
song
teenagers
gather
on
a
cabin
deck
the
teens
live
in
and
around
bishop
a
<collocation>mountain town</collocation>
surrounded
by
wilderness
all
are
members
of
a
<collocation>science club</collocation>
called
earth
to
sky
calculus


a
shower
of
meteors
shooting
stars
is
supposed
to
<collocation>peak tonight</collocation>
in
just
a
few
minutes
these
teens
will
release
a
balloon
that
will
rise
to
the
edge
of
space
their
goal
is
to
get
pictures
of
a
<collocation>shooting star</collocation>


a
payload
is
something
carried
by
an
aircraft
or
spacecraft
the
balloon
payload
is
a
padded
lunchbox
the
students
secure
the
lunchbox
to
the
bottom
of
the
balloon
a
camera
to
record
the
meteors
is
inside
two
<collocation>gps trackers</collocation>
are
mounted
on
the
outside
to
help
them
find
the
payload
later

over
the
last
four
years
the
club
has
launched
balloons


student
aaron
lamb
inflates
the
<collocation>latest balloon</collocation>
with
a
tank
of
helium
eventually
it
grows
to
the
size
of
a
car


launch
time
nears
<collocation>everything checks</collocation>
out
ok
and
it
time
for
liftoff



five
four
three
two
one
they
chant
the
balloon
begins
to
rise


there
is
quiet
and
a
feeling
of
wonder
then
the
balloon
disappears
into
the
night


the
balloon
project
wouldn
t
have
happened
if
not
for
one
of
the
student
parents
the
parent
is
<collocation>scientist tony</collocation>
phillips


phillips
is
not
only
a
scientist
he
also
a
<collocation>dog lover</collocation>
those
howling
huskies
are
his


earth
to
sky
calculus
began
seven
years
ago
phillips
decided
then
that
it
was
time
to
give
students
a
hands
on
experience
of
science
since
then
the
club
has
carried
out
many
experiments
involving
high
flying
balloons


the
balloon
is
almost
always
launched
with
a
<collocation>lightweight camera</collocation>
the
<collocation>camera records</collocation>
the
balloon
journey
the
popping
of
the
balloon
once
it
gets
too
high
is
also
caught
on
camera


as
the
<collocation>balloon journeys</collocation>
up
and
up
the
air
<collocation>pressure lessens</collocation>
gradually
the
<collocation>balloon expands</collocation>
until
it
almost
the
size
of
a
house
then
it
pops
in
a
breathtaking
explosion


a
parachute
attached
to
the
lunchbox
helps
it
land
safely
back
on
earth
the
students
find
it
using
the
<collocation>gps trackers</collocation>


and
that
when
things
get
crazy



the
lunchbox
has
landed
but
where


finding
the
payload
is
never
simple
the
balloon
almost
always
lands
in
the
middle
of
nowhere


early
on
saturday
phillips
checked
the
payload
gps
the
payload
had
landed
<collocation>miles west</collocation>
of
bishop


the
hiking
would
be
beautiful
through
<collocation>sequoia trees</collocation>
and
past
waterfalls
things
could
turn
difficult
though
if
the
payload
had
landed
on
a
<collocation>high peak</collocation>


sometimes
when
a
<collocation>payload lands</collocation>
in
an
easy
to
get
to
spot
half
a
dozen
people
collect
the
lunchbox
this
time
though
it
was
just
phillips
and
student
michael
white
of
all
the
experienced
hikers
in
the
group
white
is
the
most
skilled


white
and
phillips
thought
the
pick
up
might
not
be
too
bad
it
appeared
that
the
payload
had
fallen
in
a
<collocation>canyon less</collocation>
than
miles
from
a
marked
trail


the
<collocation>pair set</collocation>
off
marching
briskly
up
a
mile
trail
that
rose
some
feet


they
turned
left
and
followed
a
marked
trail
for
more
miles
then
things
stopped
being
easy
the
last
half
mile
took
phillips
and
white
five
hours


the
slopes
were
steep
even
worse
when
they
weren
t
covered
in
rock
they
were
covered
in
old
pine
needles


the
two
had
to
dig
their
fingers
deep
into
the
dirt
phillips
said
then
they
had
to
pull
themselves
up


finally
<collocation>white spotted</collocation>
the
payload
it
was
high
on
a
<collocation>flat rock</collocation>
in
the
middle
of
a
waterfall


the
two
of
them
had
entered
the
forest
at
a
m
eleven
hours
later
they
returned
payload
in
hand
