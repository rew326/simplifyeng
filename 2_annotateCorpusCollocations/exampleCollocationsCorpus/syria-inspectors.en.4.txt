to
an
<collocation>area southwest</collocation>
of
the
<collocation>capital damascus</collocation>

bullets
forced
the

for

the
u
n
appeared
to
have
worked
out
an
agreement
with
the
two
sides
in
the
war
the
inspectors
will
be
able
to
travel
safely
no

released
each
side
blamed
the
other
for
the
<collocation>sniper fire</collocation>
the

in

the

u
n
secretary

the

is
supposed
to
find
out
whether
<collocation>chemical weapons</collocation>
were
used
they
are
not
there
to
find
out
who
used
them
the
rebels
and
the
government
have
been
<collocation>trading blame</collocation>
for
who
was
responsible
many
in
the
west
want
<collocation>foreign armies</collocation>
to
get
involved
each

has
its
own
<collocation>international supporters</collocation>


those

attack
<collocation>last week</collocation>

hundreds
of
people
outside

were
not
soldiers
they

there
was
no
word
about
whether

inspectors
learned
anything
on
monday
nobody
said
whether
they
found
anything
to
back
up
what
the
rebels
said
or
if
they
found
anything
to
show
the
rebels
were
lying



<collocation>inspectors talk</collocation>
to
witnesses

syrian
<collocation>president bashar</collocation>
assad
strongly
denied
what
the
rebels
said
his
said
this
in
an
interview
with
the
russian
<collocation>newspaper izvestia</collocation>
the
comments
were
published
on
monday


the
inspectors
traveled
to
two
<collocation>field hospitals</collocation>
they
interviewed
witnesses
doctors
and
people
who
lived
through
the
attack
ban
said
the
inspectors
took
statements
they
also
collected
unspecified
samples


officials
previously
said
that
the
team
would
be
seeking
traces
of
soil
that
had
signs
of
poison
they
would
also
collect
tissue
hair
and
other
samples
from
victims
the
samples
will
be
taken
for
<collocation>laboratory tests</collocation>
it
could
take
weeks
before
the
results
are
known


it
was
not
clear
why
the
team
initially
chose
to
<collocation>visit muadhamiya</collocation>
about
people
were
reported
killed
there
in
<collocation>last week</collocation>
suspected
<collocation>chemical attack</collocation>
but
the
hardest
hit
area
was
said
to
be
in
the
opposite
direction


an
anti
government
group
in
muadhamiya
was
waiting
when
the
inspectors
arrived
according
to
someone
in
the
town
the
person
was
reached
on
a
video
messaging
service
the
u
n
experts
spoke
with
doctors
and
patients
at
a
<collocation>field hospital</collocation>
they
also
took
blood
and
<collocation>hair samples</collocation>
the
person
said



u
and
russia
disagree
over
syria

some
in
the
u
n
group
then
went
to
visit
a
mosque
the
<collocation>religious site</collocation>
was
allegedly
hit
during
the
<collocation>chemical attack</collocation>
<collocation>last week</collocation>
they
visited
another
reported
site
of
a
rocket
attack


video
that
was
supposedly
from
the
inspectors
visit
showed
u
n
workers
wearing
<collocation>blue helmets</collocation>
speaking
with
people
they
were
also
visiting
what
looked
like
a
<collocation>medical treatment</collocation>
area
some
patients
were
lying
in
beds


<collocation>chemical weapons</collocation>
are
considered
especially
bad
they
cause
terrible
suffering
along
with
death


the
<collocation>white house</collocation>
said
on
sunday
there
was
very
little
doubt
that
syrian
forces
had
used
<collocation>poison gas</collocation>
against
ordinary
people
the
statement
seemed
to
suggest
the
u
may
get
its
military
involved


russia
said
monday
it
warned
u
secretary
of
<collocation>state john</collocation>
kerry
not
to
use
force
against
syria
it
would
be
extremely
dangerous
to
do
so
russia
said


the
<collocation>civil war</collocation>
in
syria
is
one
of
several
on
which
the
united
states
and
russia
strongly
disagree
