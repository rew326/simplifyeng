calif
college
student
michael
sandoval
has
made
a
<collocation>remarkable discovery</collocation>
a
galaxy
unlike
anything
ever
seen
before


galaxies
are
made
up
of
millions
or
billions
of
stars
the
stars
in
a
particular
group
or
system
are
held
together
by
gravity
normally
stars
in
a
system
are
much
farther
apart
than
what
<collocation>sandoval spotted</collocation>


twenty
one
year
old
sandoval
is
a
student
at
<collocation>san jose</collocation>
state
university
not
too
long
ago
he
enrolled
in
his
first
<collocation>astrophysics class</collocation>
astrophysics
is
the
study
of
the
stars
and
planets


sandoval
stumbled
upon
his
unusual
find
after
only
a
week
of
looking
he
and
his
professor
have
named
what
he
spotted
a
hypercompact
cluster
they
believe
it
is
the
remains
of
one
galaxy
that
was
swallowed
up
by
another


<collocation>professor aaron</collocation>
romanowsky
said
it
astounding
how
quickly
his
student
discovered
<collocation>something important</collocation>
some
people
take
years
and
never
find
anything
he
said



i
can
find
one
of
those
too


the
search
was
a
welcome
distraction
for
sandoval
his
mother
died
of
cancer
in
october
in
the
last
years
of
his
mom
life
sandoval
helped
take
care
of
her
at
times
he
had
to
rush
her
to
the
<collocation>emergency room</collocation>
at
night
then
drag
himself
to
class
the
next
day


several
months
after
his
mother
died
sandoval
enrolled
in
romanowsky
<collocation>astrophysics course</collocation>
he
soon
learned
that
<collocation>classmate richard</collocation>
vo
had
discovered
something
highly
unusual
a
super
<collocation>dense dwarf</collocation>
galaxy
dwarf
galaxies
have
fewer
stars
than
ones
like
our
own
the
<collocation>dwarf galaxy</collocation>
vo
discovered
is
possibly
the
densest
ever
found


sandoval
thought
was
immediate
i
want
to
find
one
too


sandoval
set
to
work
on
his
laptop
using
pictures
from
the
<collocation>hubble space</collocation>
telescope
and
the
sloan
digital
<collocation>sky survey</collocation>
he
began
searching
the
universe
for
unusual
objects
i
didn
t
want
to
be
sitting
home
<collocation>feeling sorry</collocation>
for
myself
said
sandoval
that
not
what
she
would
have
wanted
anyway


instead
he
vo
and
romanoswky
are
rushing
to
release
their
findings



dwarf
galaxies
waiting
to
be
discovered

romanowsky
was
one
of
the
first
scientists
to
discover
a
<collocation>dense dwarf</collocation>
galaxy
what
vo
later
found
was
the
same
type
of
galaxy
but
especially
dense


sandoval
was
also
searching
for
the
same
kind
of
galaxy
what
he
turned
up
instead
was
something
weird
romanowsky
said
it
was
unlike
anything
romanowsky
had
ever
seen


think
of
a
<collocation>dwarf galaxy</collocation>
as
being
like
an
apple
core
romanowsky
said
what
sandoval
found
is
like
the
seeds
in
other
words
it
is
even
smaller
and
denser


until
recently
scientists
hadn
t
thought
to
search
for
<collocation>dense star</collocation>
systems



it
something
that
been
hiding
in
plain
sight
romanowsky
said


the
new
discoveries
could
reshape
our
understanding
of
the
universe


both
students
were
passionate
about
the
project
romanowsky
said
they
were
pushing
him
not
the
other
way
around
they
re
sending
me
emails
at
midnight
professor
will
you
send
me
more
information
he
said



nothing
boring
about
it

their
discoveries
could
help
bring
more
students
into
the
sciences
said
<collocation>scientist natalie</collocation>
batalha
glimpsing
something
no
one
has
ever
seen
is
an
<collocation>amazing experience</collocation>
she
said
it
feels
like
uncovering
the
mysteries
of
the
universe


not
many
young
people
want
to
become
scientists
she
added
perhaps
she
suggested
they
mistakenly
think
scientists
are
boring


vo
certainly
doesn
t
fit
anyone
idea
of
the
<collocation>boring scientist</collocation>
he
has
tattoos
on
his
arms
and
a
<collocation>funny sense</collocation>
of
humor
before
beginning
his
project
he
described
his
task
as
basically
<collocation>finding waldo</collocation>


as
for
sandoval
his
discovery
makes
him
think
of
his
mom
it
always
embarrassed
him
when
she
bragged
about
his
science
studies
he
said
he
felt
he
had
done
nothing
special



after
this
has
happened
he
said
i
m
pretty
sure
she
proud
