washington
<collocation>private companies</collocation>
are
starting
to
get
into
the
business
of
bringing
people
and
cargo
into
space
governments
aren
t
the
only
ones
launching
rockets
anymore
but
some
people
are
worried
they
think
that
the
government
will
make
up
all
sorts
of
new
rules
to
make
it
harder
for
the
companies
to
settle
this
new
frontier


the
people
making
the
rules
are
from
the
federal
aviation
administration
faa
that
government
<collocation>agency licenses</collocation>
commercial
rocket
launches
in
other
words
private
for
profit
trips
to
<collocation>outer space</collocation>


the
faa
has
so
far
been
very
limited
in
what
it
can
do
once
a
<collocation>spacecraft reaches</collocation>
orbit
there
are
not
a
lot
of
rules


but
that
could
change
soon



companies
looking
at
<collocation>outer space</collocation>

faa
officials
and
space
lawyers
have
been
holding
meetings
this
past
week
the
topic
possible
new
rules
everything
from
<collocation>mining rights</collocation>
to
<collocation>safety practices</collocation>
is
being
looked
at


some
guidelines
were
issued
in
the
past
the
<collocation>outer space</collocation>
treaty
of
for
example
prevents
nations
from
saying
that
they
own
the
moon
but
<collocation>space rules</collocation>
have
been
few
and
far
between


that
is
because
few
countries
have
had
the
ability
to
head
into
space
it
has
been
even
harder
for
<collocation>private companies</collocation>


but
space
businesses
have
been
growing
rapidly
more
and
more
companies
are
looking
to
make
money
in
space


in
spacex
became
the
first
company
to
deliver
cargo
in
space
<collocation>space tourism</collocation>
is
taking
off
too
<collocation>virgin galactic</collocation>
and
xcor
aerospace
may
soon
carry
passengers
into
space


all
this
has
caught
the
attention
of
government
and
business
many
feel
there
is
now
a
need
for
rules
they
hope
to
figure
out
how
people
and
property
can
stay
safe
in
space



<collocation>space junk</collocation>
and
<collocation>traffic rules</collocation>

<collocation>various problems</collocation>
are
being
considered
for
example
how
to
limit
the
amount
of
dangerous
<collocation>space junk</collocation>
shed
by
spacecraft
how
to
come
up
with
<collocation>space traffic</collocation>
rules
is
another
problem


george
nield
who
heads
the
faa
spoke
up
this
week
in
the
near
future
he
said
there
will
be
more
commercial
transportation
vehicles
in
space
it
is
time
to
consider
setting
up
rules


right
now
the
faa
cannot
make
the
rules
a
law
says
the
faa
cannot
make
rules
about
businesses
that
are
trying
to
send
humans
into
space
the
law
purpose
is
clear
it
is
meant
to
give
the
<collocation>commercial space</collocation>
industry
a
chance
to
grow


but
that
law
is
set
to
end
next
year


congressman
steven
palazzo
says
the
law
is
still
needed
faa
rules
he
said
could
prove
to
be
harmful
they
could
stop
businesses
from
going
into
space


but
some
in
the
<collocation>commercial space</collocation>
industry
see
things
differently
they
say
that
a
few
more
rules
would
be
a
good
thing



<collocation>sea laws</collocation>
may
make
sense
in
space

rules
are
going
to
be
made
said
<collocation>mike gold</collocation>
of
bigelow
aerospace
the
question
is
who
should
make
them


demand
for
rules
is
coming
from
different
places
some
of
the
demands
are
coming
from
<collocation>insurance companies</collocation>
insurers
protect
people
and
businesses
by
paying
out
money
if
something
goes
wrong


<collocation>lawyer brian</collocation>
mitchell
said
<collocation>insurers need</collocation>
rules
it
is
a
problem
for
them
if
there
are
no
rules
of
the
road
up
in
space
without
rules
you
do
not
know
who
is
responsible
when
something
goes
wrong


but
there
one
big
problem
when
it
comes
to
setting
rules
right
now
there
are
hardly
any
rules
at
all
because
of
that
<collocation>lawyer russ</collocation>
mcmurry
has
a
suggestion
take
a
look
at
old
laws
written
for
<collocation>wooden ships</collocation>


some
of
the
old
laws
of
the
sea
he
said
might
make
sense
in
space
too
