since
last
year
millions
of
<collocation>sea stars</collocation>
have
died
a
disease
has
killed
the
animals
also
called
starfish
from
alaska
to
mexico
it
an
epidemic
a
disease
that
is
out
of
control


scientists
say
they
ve
never
seen
a
disease
this
bad
in
the
ocean


<collocation>sea stars</collocation>
started
dying
in
<collocation>washington state</collocation>
in
the
deaths
spread
south
they
reached
oregon
california
and
<collocation>baja california</collocation>
starfish
even
died
in
<collocation>city aquariums</collocation>


this
week
a
team
of
scientists
announced
a
discovery
the
team
figured
out
what
is
killing
the
starfish
it
is
a
virus


the
virus
isn
t
new
they
said
<collocation>sea stars</collocation>
in
museums
going
back
to
have
it
that
means
the
virus
has
been
in
the
<collocation>pacific ocean</collocation>
for
years



wasting
syndrome
kills

in
the
past
the
virus
killed
<collocation>smaller numbers</collocation>
of
starfish
no
one
knows
what
caused
the
virus
to
explode
in
the
past
year
it
has
killed
up
to
percent
of
the
<collocation>sea stars</collocation>
in
some
areas
in
other
words
only
five
out
of
every
starfish
in
a
group
lived


the
disease
that
is
killing
starfish
is
known
as
wasting
syndrome
at
least
different
species
of
starfish
have
it


a
<collocation>sea star</collocation>
with
wasting
<collocation>syndrome moves</collocation>
more
slowly
it
develops
<collocation>white sores</collocation>
its
arms
begin
to
break
off
and
crawl
away
finally
the
starfish
turns
into
a
gooey
mess
and
dies


wasting
syndrome
is
caused
by
the
virus
scientists
found
it
a
<collocation>type similar</collocation>
to
one
that
affects
insects
<collocation>sea urchins</collocation>
and
other
invertebrates
animals
without
a
spine



humans
not
affected

scientists
now
know
what
is
killing
the
starfish
but
the
mystery
is
still
not
solved



what
started
it
all
off
asked
dr
<collocation>mike murray</collocation>
of
the
monterey
bay
aquarium
are
there
other
problems
in
other
species


there
are
many
more
questions
to
answer
still
the
discovery
is
a
<collocation>huge breakthrough</collocation>
murray
said


the
scientists
found
that
the
<collocation>virus spreads</collocation>
in
seawater
and
sand
it
does
not
affect
humans
there
is
no
way
to
offer
a
cure
for
starfish



it
would
be
nice
if
we
could
do
that
murray
said
he
compared
the
starfish
disease
to
<collocation>human epidemics</collocation>
in
the
the
<collocation>black death</collocation>
killed
millions
of
people
in
europe



modern
<collocation>genetic tools</collocation>

the
starfish
die
off
may
or
may
not
be
caused
by
humans
murray
said
the
die
off
will
continue
on
its
<collocation>own path</collocation>
he
said
hopefully
the
<collocation>sea stars</collocation>
will
get
through
this
but
there
is
a
chance
all
starfish
could
die
off
he
added


scientists
at
<collocation>cornell university</collocation>
discovered
the
virus
using
<collocation>genetic tools</collocation>



there
are
million
viruses
in
a
drop
of
seawater
said
<collocation>cornell scientist</collocation>
ian
hewson
discovering
a
virus
can
be
like
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
haystack


the
cornell
scientists
worked
with
starfish
collected
on
the
<collocation>west coast</collocation>
they
exposed
healthy
starfish
to
<collocation>infected ones</collocation>
it
taught
them
how
the
<collocation>disease spreads</collocation>


scientists
now
know
what
causes
the
disease
now
they
need
to
find
out
made
it
spread
so
quickly
too
many
starfish
living
close
together
is
one
explanation



more
<collocation>baby starfish</collocation>

<collocation>other explanations</collocation>
<collocation>blame humans</collocation>
pollution
and
<collocation>climate change</collocation>


<collocation>sea stars</collocation>
have
an
important
job
in
<collocation>tide pools</collocation>
and
<collocation>shallow waters</collocation>
near
the
shore
they
eat
mussels
clams
and
snails
without
starfish
the
numbers
of
those
other
shellfish
could
get
out
of
control


scientists
have
one
cause
for
hope
<collocation>sea stars</collocation>
in
some
areas
had
more
babies
than
usual
in
the
past
year
all
those
<collocation>baby starfish</collocation>
may
be
the
species
fighting
back
against
this
disease


still
big
questions
remain
how
long
will
the
disease
continue
to
kill
starfish
will
it
affect
other
species
more
study
is
needed
scientists
say
