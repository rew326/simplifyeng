washington
your
<collocation>phone calls</collocation>
cannot
be
secretly
listened
to
anymore
the
<collocation>national security</collocation>
agency
nsa
has
lost
the
right
to
spy
on
you


the
nsa
hunts
for
terrorists
in
the
united
states
it
relies
on
something
called
surveillance
to
find
them
surveillance
involves
secretly
looking
and
listening


the
nsa
has
been
collecting
millions
of
<collocation>phone calls</collocation>
<collocation>such phone</collocation>
calls
are
made
by
ordinary
americans
every
day
the
nsa
hopes
to
<collocation>spot terrorists</collocation>
talking
to
each
other


many
people
think
that
<collocation>nsa surveillance</collocation>
goes
too
far
americans
should
not
have
to
worry
about
being
spied
on
they
say


a
man
named
<collocation>edward snowden</collocation>
revealed
the
secret
about
the
<collocation>nsa surveillance</collocation>
snowden
once
worked
for
the
nsa


after
snowden
spoke
out
people
began
demanding
that
<collocation>surveillance laws</collocation>
be
changed
a
new
set
of
<collocation>surveillance laws</collocation>
called
the
<collocation>usa freedom</collocation>
act
was
introduced
the
new
act
is
supported
by
president
obama


the
<collocation>usa freedom</collocation>
act
introduces
some
big
changes
under
it
the
nsa
will
no
longer
be
able
to
collect
<collocation>phone records</collocation>
however
the
nsa
will
still
be
able
to
search
the
records
held
by
phone
companies



<collocation>things got</collocation>
tricky
in
the
senate

the
<collocation>usa freedom</collocation>
act
passed
in
the
house
on
may
then
it
went
on
to
the
senate
the
other
branch
of
congress
the
senate
needs
to
pass
the
act
too
before
it
can
become
law


<collocation>things got</collocation>
tricky
once
the
new
act
reached
the
senate
a
group
of
senators
led
by
mitch
mcconnell
do
not
like
some
things
about
the
<collocation>usa freedom</collocation>
act
they
say
it
makes
it
too
hard
for
the
nsa
to
keep
americans
safe
they
want
the
nsa
to
be
able
to
<collocation>search phone</collocation>
records
more
quickly
and
easily
the
senators
would
not
agree
to
vote
for
the
bill
unless
some
changes
were
made
to
it


the
bill
needed
to
be
voted
on
by
monday
in
order
to
go
into
law
at
the
<collocation>last minute</collocation>
mcconnell
and
the
others
agreed
to
vote
for
it
after
all
even
without
changes
president
obama
had
strongly
urged
them
not
to
miss
the
deadline


but
in
the
end
the
bill
did
not
go
through
a
vote
was
delayed
and
the
deadline
was
missed
now
there
is
no
law
allowing
the
nsa
surveillance
it
had
to
stop
collecting
calls



one
senator
stopped
the
vote

what
happened
was
that
one
senator
prevented
a
senate
vote
from
taking
place
that
man
is
<collocation>rand paul</collocation>


paul
is
now
running
for
president
he
is
strongly
against
surveillance
paul
says
it
takes
freedoms
from
americans
we
should
not
give
up
our
freedoms
so
easily
he
argues



this
is
what
we
fought
the
revolution
over
paul
said
i
m
not
going
to
take
it
anymore


no
new
vote
on
the
bill
is
likely
before
tuesday
at
the
earliest


paul
<collocation>decision angered</collocation>
many
other
senators


<collocation>senator john</collocation>
mccain
complained
bitterly
to
reporters
paul
cares
more
about
running
for
president
than
he
does
about
the
safety
of
the
nation
mccain
said


the
government
warned
that
not
passing
new
<collocation>surveillance laws</collocation>
would
be
dangerous
however
it
said
having
no
laws
for
a
few
days
or
weeks
is
not
a
big
problem
surveillance
of
known
terrorists
will
still
be
permitted


the
problem
will
become
serious
if
no
new
laws
are
ever
introduced
the
government
said
that
could
happen
if
the
senate
cannot
reach
an
agreement
