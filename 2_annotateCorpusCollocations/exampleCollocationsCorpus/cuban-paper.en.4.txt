writes
a
<collocation>popular blog</collocation>
about
life
in
cuba
called
<collocation>generacion y</collocation>
she
now
plans
to
open
a
<collocation>digital newspaper</collocation>
in
just
a
few
weeks


but
the
cuban
government
may
not
allow
the
paper
because
of
that
writers
at
the
paper
are
looking
for
<collocation>original ways</collocation>
to
get
it
to
their
readers
they
may
send
it
through
<collocation>text messages</collocation>
and
emails
they
may
also
put
them
on
<collocation>storage devices</collocation>
that
can
be
handed
out


sanchez
spoke
about
the
newspaper
at
the
hispanicize
<collocation>conference tuesday</collocation>
in
miami


the
new
paper
will
include
news
sports
interviews
and
reports
based
on
investigations



a
force
for
change


sanchez
won
t
say
the
name
of
the
newspaper
but
said
she
hopes
it
will
launch
in
late
april
or
early
may
giving
out
the
newspaper
name
could
be
risky
in
cuba
the
government
is
run
by
<collocation>raul castro</collocation>
it
controls
all
cuba
newspapers
radio
and
<collocation>television stations</collocation>
and
it
doesn
t
always
allow
businesses
to
open



i
have
become
a
journalist
on
the
run
says
sanchez
she
believes
information
can
be
a
force
for
change


the
newspaper
will
be
sent
mainly
through
cellphones
and
emails
she
said
cubans
have
more
<collocation>cell phones</collocation>
than
computers
just
out
every
cubans
owns
a
computer
says
the
government
sanchez
also
plans
to
load
the
newspaper
onto
usb
flash
drives
dvds
and
cds
cubans
regularly
pass
them
around
hand
to
hand


the
newspaper
workers
are
also
working
on
<collocation>several backup</collocation>
ways
of
getting
the
newspaper
to
readers
they
need
ways
of
getting
around
the
government
sanchez
added
some
papers
send
articles
to
people
in
other
countries
then
those
people
send
them
back
electronically


government
officials
may
give
her
and
her
staff
a
hard
time
sanchez
said
the
cuban
government
may
stop
the
paper
from
being
sent
around
she
thinks
the
government
may
<collocation>spread lies</collocation>
about
the
newspaper
workers
or
the
government
might
give
them
wrong
information
to
publish



a
permit
to
be
a
typist

several
<collocation>cuban journalists</collocation>
have
been
arrested
by
the
government
they
ve
been
accused
of
publishing
<collocation>false news</collocation>
against
world
peace


sanchez
noted
that
the
cuban
government
refuses
to
give
work
permits
for
journalists
who
work
on
their
own
journalists
who
work
for
tv
and
newspapers
controlled
by
the
government
can
get
permits
however
sanchez
applied
for
the
<collocation>closest type</collocation>
of
work
she
got
a
permit
to
be
a
typist
she
got
laughs
when
she
told
people
this


cuba
government
approved
a
new
law
over
the
weekend
it
promises
to
make
the
country
more
open
to
business
with
other
countries
however
sanchez
said
she
doesn
t
trust
the
cuban
government
it
has
seized
the
property
of
business
leaders
before


the
cuban
government
does
not
respect
businesses
she
said
sanchez
hopes
that
people
in
other
countries
will
support
tiny
cuban
businesses
these
businesses
are
known
as
self
employment
they
could
be
as
small
as
a
<collocation>single fruit</collocation>
seller


having
the
right
to
run
your
own
business
is
important
she
said
it
a
form
of
freedom
just
like
having
the
right
to
vote
