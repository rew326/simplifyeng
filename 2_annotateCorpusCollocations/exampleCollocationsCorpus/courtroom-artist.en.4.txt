not
long
ago
she
sat
in
court
at
a
big
trial
in

she
had
a
<collocation>plastic bag</collocation>

no
pencils
no
erasing

there
are
not
many
<collocation>sketch artists</collocation>
around
today
<collocation>television cameras</collocation>
have
taken
over
in
many
courtrooms
artists
have
found
work
at
trials
where
cameras
are
not
allowed


edwards
became
interested
in
the
business
when
she
<collocation>saw courtroom</collocation>
drawings
on
tv
many
years
ago
she
knew
she
could
do
a
better
job



they
were
awful
just
awful
she
told
her
husband


edwards
had
been
working
for
years
drawing
pictures
for
<collocation>fancy clothing</collocation>
companies
and
stores
she
thought
that
her
drawing
skills
could
work
in
the
courtroom


edwards
said
that
at
a
trial
she
always
works
the
same
way


she
first
finds
something
that
stands
out
about
a
person
it
could
be
a
<collocation>hair style</collocation>
lips
or
their
nose
then
she
looks
at
how
a
person
stands
and
how
their
<collocation>clothes fit</collocation>
next
she
draws
the
pictures
in
her
mind
she
plans
it
out
and
starts
to
draw
on
paper
she
never
uses
a
pencil
and
never
erases



paper
sketches
go
way
back
in
time

<collocation>courtroom drawings</collocation>
have
a
long
history


an
artist
drew
the
salem
witch
trials
of
when
people
were
accused
of
being
witches
drawings
also
were
made
at
the
trial
of
people
involved
in
the
killing
of
<collocation>president abraham</collocation>
lincoln


then
<collocation>richard bruno</collocation>
hauptmann
went
on
trial
in
he
was
charged
with
killing
charles
lindbergh
son
lindbergh
was
a
famous
pilot
<collocation>news coverage</collocation>
of
the
trial
was
crazy
reporters
snuck
in
hidden
cameras
and
tape
recorders
to
play
the
trial
on
the
radio


the
reporting
on
the
case
caused
the
<collocation>american bar</collocation>
association
to
get
involved
the
group
represents
lawyers
in
the
united
states
they
asked
judges
to
stop
letting
cameras
into
courtrooms
judges
agreed
to
this
for
many
years
some
judges
eventually
loosened
the
rules
while
others
will
still
not
allow
cameras



quietly
sketching
the
mood

the
o
j
<collocation>simpson case</collocation>
was
one
of
the
first
trials
to
be
shown
live
on
television
edwards
said
people
thought
it
would
be
the
end
for
<collocation>courtroom artists</collocation>


the
jury
decided
they
could
not
say
that
simpson
committed
the
crime
then
people
complained
about
the
way
news
groups
covered
the
trial
the
anger
over
the
coverage
caused
judges
to
be
stricter
about
allowing
cameras
in
their
courtrooms


ronald
h
rose
is
a
retired
judge
in
<collocation>los angeles</collocation>
he
said
cameras
change
the
way
people
in
a
case
behave
in
court
sometimes
they
act
out
or
get
very
nervous
it
can
make
it
harder
people
to
make
an
<collocation>honest choice</collocation>
about
whether
someone
is
guilty
or
innocent


edwards
can
easily
blend
in
and
<collocation>sketch pictures</collocation>
that
show
the
mood
of
the
courtroom


she
is
like
the
eye
in
the
courtroom
for
all
of
us
