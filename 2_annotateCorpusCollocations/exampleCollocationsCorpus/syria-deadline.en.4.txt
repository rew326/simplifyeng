geneva
the
united
states
and
russia
made
a
<collocation>deal saturday</collocation>
they
agreed
to
make
syria
get
rid
of
its
<collocation>poison gas</collocation>
weapons
syria
<collocation>president bashar</collocation>
al
assad
has
one
week
to
show
what
kind
of
weapons
his
country
has
he
must
also
show
where
they
are
stored


there
is
a
<collocation>november deadline</collocation>
for
ending
syria
ability
to
make
the
weapons
anything
that
could
be
used
to
make
the
weapons
must
be
destroyed
by
the
middle
of
next
year


the
deal
says
inspectors
from
other
countries
can
go
anywhere
in
syria
immediately
nobody
would
be
able
to
get
in
the
way
their
first
inspections
have
to
be
finished
by
november


u
<collocation>president barack</collocation>
obama
praised
the
agreement
he
called
it
an
important
<collocation>concrete step</collocation>
toward
the
goal
of
destroying
the
weapons
but
the
united
states
could
still
act
with
force
if
the
<collocation>peaceful solution</collocation>
did
not
work
he
said



syria
seen
going
along
with
deal

a
u
military
attack
seemed
just
hours
away
only
two
weeks
ago
now
it
appears
far
from
happening
syria
could
be
attacked
if
it
does
not
follow
the
agreement
but
the
u
n
<collocation>security council</collocation>
would
have
to
give
permission
russia
can
stop
the
council
from
doing
that
through
a
veto


syria
and
assad
did
not
immediately
react
syria
gets
most
of
its
weapons
from
russia
so
it
will
probably
do
what
russia
agreed
to


syrian
rebels
were
not
happy
with
the
agreement
they
said
it
lets
assad
get
away
with
the
deaths
of
hundreds
of
people
killed
with
<collocation>poison gas</collocation>


but
<collocation>rebel gen</collocation>
salim
idriss
said
his
group
would
help
the
inspectors
it
would
not
shoot
when
<collocation>inspectors pass</collocation>
through
government
held
areas
where
rebels
are
fighting
but
idriss
said
the
rebels
would
not
agree
to
a
general
cease
fire
<collocation>idriss heads</collocation>
the
<collocation>syrian military</collocation>
council
the
u
supports
his
group


how
other
rebel
groups
would
respond
is
still
not
known
those
groups
include
two
that
have
ties
to
al
qaida
they
are
also
the
syrian
rebels
best
fighters



russia
supports
assad
in
war

magnus
ranstorp
is
an
expert
on
terrorism
at
the
swedish
<collocation>defense college</collocation>
he
said
that
both
groups
do
not
like
the
united
states
russia
or
the
united
nations
they
could
target
the
attempt
to
control
<collocation>poison gas</collocation>
rebels
from
<collocation>central asia</collocation>
and
the
caucasus
have
fought
bitter
battles
against
russia
they
could
try
to
cause
problems



i
think
this
is
definitely
a
risk
he
said


the
agreement
is
a
<collocation>remarkable event</collocation>
in
syria
<collocation>civil war</collocation>
more
than
people
from
both
sides
have
been
killed
during
the
war
a
total
of
million
people
have
been
forced
from
their
homes
in
the
past
months
there
also
seemed
to
be
no
way
the
united
states
and
russia
could
agree
about
how
the
conflict
should
be
resolved
at
least
not
until
recently


only
two
weeks
ago
the
united
states
appeared
to
be
just
hours
away
from
sending
missiles
into
syria
the
attack
was
going
to
be
punishment
for
a
supposed
aug
<collocation>poison gas</collocation>
attack
that
killed
hundreds
of
people
russia
was
defending
syria
it
insisted
that
the
rebels
were
responsible
for
the
gas
attack



u
doesn
t
completely
trust
russia

at
one
point
russian
<collocation>president vladimir</collocation>
putin
called
u
secretary
of
<collocation>state john</collocation>
kerry
a
liar
<collocation>last week</collocation>
putin
wrote
a
column
that
appeared
in
the
<collocation>new york</collocation>
times
it
accused
the
united
states
of
violating
international
law
for
its
<collocation>syrian threats</collocation>


but
it
took
just
two
days
to
hammer
out
the
agreement
there
was
little
sign
of
bad
feelings
when
the
agreement
was
announced
on
saturday


kerry
indicated
the
u
did
not
completely
trust
russia
he
recalled
what
<collocation>president ronald</collocation>
reagan
said
about
dealing
with
the
<collocation>soviet union</collocation>
trust
but
verify
verify
means
you
have
to
make
sure



verify
then
verify
is
the
new
u
motto
kerry
said
