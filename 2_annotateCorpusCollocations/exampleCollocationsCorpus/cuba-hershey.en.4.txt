on
the
island
of
cuba
there
are
<collocation>road signs</collocation>
pointing
to
a
turnoff
for
camilo
<collocation>cienfuegos city</collocation>
but
there
is
no
city
with
that
name



air
shee
is
what
everyone
still
calls
it
hershey


the
town
was
founded
by
u
chocolate
<collocation>company owner</collocation>
<collocation>milton hershey</collocation>
in
today
most
of
it
is
in
ruins
the
huge
sugar
mill
was
once
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
now
it
looks
like
it
was
blasted
by
a
bomb



revolution
changed
things

in
a
man
named
<collocation>fidel castro</collocation>
led
a
revolution
in
cuba
he
started
a
communist
government


in
the
<collocation>communist system</collocation>
there
are
no
businesses
owned
by
any
<collocation>single person</collocation>
instead
the
government
owns
the
businesses
people
from
united
states
who
had
businesses
in
cuba
had
to
leave


this
was
a
big
deal
for
towns
like
hershey
the
town
survived
because
of
american
companies



cuba
chocolate
town
grew

the
history
of
the
town
is
complicated


<collocation>milton hershey</collocation>
arrived
in
cuba
in
the
early
land
was
cheap
and
cuba
needed
help
after
a
war
many
americans
thought
business
would
solve
cuba
problems


hershey
chose
to
build
an
all
american
town
in
the
<collocation>sugar cane</collocation>
fields
on
cuba
<collocation>northern coast</collocation>
he
also
built
schools
<collocation>health centers</collocation>
and
housing
for
his
workers


the
town
was
doing
well
there
were
so
many
<collocation>hershey chocolate</collocation>
bars
and
hershey
kisses
that
they
would
go
bad
and
the
shopkeepers
would
just
throw
them
away


<collocation>milton hershey</collocation>
died
in
before
he
did
he
left
instructions
to
sell
the
property
in
cuba
that
was
a
wise
idea


the
next
owner
of
the
<collocation>hershey mill</collocation>
and
<collocation>sugar cane</collocation>
field
was
julio
lobo
one
of
the
<collocation>richest men</collocation>
in
cuba


lobo
wanted
to
save
money
so
he
reduced
the
number
of
jobs
at
the
mill
and
closed
the
<collocation>main cafeteria</collocation>
in
town
the
cafeteria
had
been
a
place
that
offered
food
at
prices
all
cubans
could
pay



some
people
have
hope

when
the
new
castro
government
took
over
it
made
the
<collocation>hershey mill</collocation>
the
property
of
the
cuban
government
the
town
cafeteria
was
reopened
and
a
sign
was
hung
outside
that
said
thanks
to
the
revolution


the
town
and
its
mill
were
renamed
for
camilo
cienfuegos
a
hero
of
the
cuban
revolution
but
people
never
used
the
new
name


the
mill
closed
for
good
in
the
government
retrained
some
of
the
workers
for
other
jobs
but
many
people
left
hershey
to
live
in
other
cities


the
town
heart
its
purpose
for
existing
was
gone


elis
de
cary
rojas
moved
back
to
the
town
with
her
young
daughter
a
few
years
ago
she
likes
its
peace
and
quiet
and
space
she
prefers
it
to
living
in
a
tiny
city
apartment


still
it
does
feel
sad
there
rojas
said
there
nothing
here
no
playgrounds
no
parks
no
<collocation>ice cream</collocation>
shop
she
said
but
it
doesn
t
have
to
be
this
way
it
still
a
beautiful
place


she
has
heard
a
new
rumor
that
the
hershey
company
wanted
to
return
or
maybe
it
was
julio
lobo
family


it
did
not
matter
rojas
is
she
said
she
just
wants
someone
anyone
to
bring
the
town
back
to
life
