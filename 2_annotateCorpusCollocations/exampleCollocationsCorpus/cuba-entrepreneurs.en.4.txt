for
more
than
years
it
was
illegal
for
americans
to
trade
with
cuba
this
year
<collocation>president barack</collocation>
obama
announced
that
the
two
countries
are
beginning
to
make
peace
they
have
been
enemies
for
a
long
time
a
<collocation>big part</collocation>
of
making
peace
is
trading
buying
and
selling
goods
to
each
other


in
cuba
many
businesses
are
controlled
by
the
cuban
government
still
there
are
some
independent
businesspeople
the
u
government
wants
to
open
up
trade
so
these
people
entrepreneurs
can
make
more
money


u
officials
created
new
rules
that
make
it
easier
for
the
two
countries
to
trade
with
each
other
the
rules
say
that
some
items
can
be
traded
and
some
cannot



rules
are
complicated

the
new
rules
are
long
and
complicated
larry
feldman
is
a
lawyer
in
miami
he
tried
to
make
the
rules
easier
to
understand
to
do
this
he
made
a
list
of
all
of
the
products
that
cuba
can
export
or
sell
to
the
united
states
he
calls
it
his
yes
list


his
list
is
easier
for
most
people
to
understand
than
the
laws
themselves
still
the
list
he
made
is
long
and
detailed


there
are
more
than
entrepreneurs
in
cuba
in
cuba
entrepreneurs
are
called
cuentapropistas


the
u
government
hopes
that
the
new
policy
makes
it
easier
for
these
workers
to
succeed



what
can
and
cannot
be
traded

the
new
policy
allows
cuba
to
sell
certain
things
to
americans
it
also
prohibits
some
things
from
being
traded


<collocation>paper products</collocation>
glass
hats
umbrellas
toys
games
flowers
and
feathers
can
be
traded
so
can
soap
candles
perfume
jewelry
watches
and
<collocation>musical instruments</collocation>


the
<collocation>state department</collocation>
also
has
a
list
of
things
that
cannot
be
traded
that
list
includes
sugar
and
<collocation>prepared drinks</collocation>
many
of
the
items
on
the
no
list
are
made
by
the
cuban
government



trade
list
should
help
cuban
businesses

the
<collocation>state department</collocation>
said
the
list
should
help
cuban
entrepreneurs
the
hope
is
that
the
new
rules
will
provide
independent
workers
with
more
chances
to
sell
their
products
cuban
entrepreneurs
might
make
more
money
under
the
new
rules
they
could
use
the
money
to
improve
their
lives
and
their
communities


the
new
rules
make
it
legal
for
the
countries
to
trade
however
that
does
not
mean
it
will
be
simple
or
easy
the
american
economy
is
very
large
working
with
small
private
cuban
businesses
and
entrepreneurs
might
be
difficult
at
first


the
cuban
government
might
not
be
ready
to
handle
the
money
and
products
from
american
customers



lack
of
mail
is
a
possible
problem

there
are
other
challenges
too
right
now
there
is
no
direct
<collocation>mail service</collocation>
between
cuba
and
the
united
states
that
could
make
shipping
goods
back
and
forth
difficult
products
that
are
sent
to
cuba
from
the
united
states
now
go
by
boat


cuba
also
has
a
complicated
money
system
that
could
make
selling
goods
to
the
united
states
tricky
cubans
use
two
types
of
money
the
country
has
a
dual
currency
system
they
use
both
the
<collocation>cuban peso</collocation>
and
the
<collocation>cuban convertible</collocation>
peso
cuc
pesos
are
used
for
everyday
purchases
cucs
are
used
by
state
companies
and
the
government


nobody
knows
how
the
laws
will
affect
the
economy
in
cuba
it
depends
on
exactly
how
the
u
and
cuba
end
up
trading
together
