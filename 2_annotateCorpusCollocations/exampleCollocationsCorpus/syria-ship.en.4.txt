washington
tons
of
<collocation>deadly chemicals</collocation>
were
collected
from
syria
after
a
<collocation>poison gas</collocation>
attack
last
summer
but
figuring
out
what
to
do
with
them
has
been
a
problem
the
united
states
has
come
up
with
a
solution
the
u
military
is
putting
special
machines
on
a
<collocation>cargo ship</collocation>
the
machines
will
be
used
to
destroy
the
chemicals


officials
said
two
machines
have
been
put
on
the
ship
named
the
<collocation>cape ray</collocation>
they
are
called
<collocation>hydrolysis machines</collocation>
the
machines
use
water
or
bleach
to
destroy
the
chemicals


the
machines
should
be
able
to
get
rid
of
syria
gas
supply
and
<collocation>chemical ingredients</collocation>
in
to
days
the
officials
said
the
chemicals
can
be
used
to
make
more
<collocation>poison gas</collocation>
no
chemicals
will
be
dumped
at
sea


syria
is
in
the
middle
of
a
<collocation>civil war</collocation>
so
the
biggest
problem
could
be
moving
the
gas
and
chemicals
to
the
ship



a
<collocation>sea operation</collocation>

the
plan
is
to
move
the
gas
and
chemicals
by
truck
they
will
be
driven
to
a
port
city
in
syria
the
port
is
called
latakia
there
the
chemicals
will
be
loaded
into
containers
u
<collocation>military planners</collocation>
fear
that
the
trucks
could
be
attacked
on
the
way
to
latakia
even
if
the
trucks
are
heavily
guarded



obviously
it
a
challenging
environment
said
a
u
official
the
official
did
not
want
to
be
named


<collocation>poison gas</collocation>
<collocation>rockets hit</collocation>
on
aug
they
struck
an
<collocation>area east</collocation>
of
damascus
syria
capital
the
zone
was
controlled
by
rebels
the
u
says
more
than
people
were
killed
the
u
threatened
to
lead
an
attack
in
response
instead
syria
<collocation>president bashar</collocation>
assad
agreed
to
surrender
his
<collocation>poison gas</collocation>
weapons


the
places
where
syria
made
<collocation>poison gas</collocation>
have
been
destroyed
so
have
the
weapons
the
next
thing
to
do
is
get
rid
of
<collocation>liquid chemicals</collocation>
those
chemicals
are
mixed
to
make
<collocation>poison gas</collocation>


no
country
would
let
the
chemicals
be
destroyed
on
their
land
so
the
chemicals
will
be
destroyed
at
sea
norway
has
offered
to
take
the
sealed
containers
from
latakia
to
a
port
outside
syria
the
containers
will
be
transferred
to
the
<collocation>cape ray</collocation>
there
the
officials
said



ship
will
have
a
lab

the
u
officials
refused
to
say
if
the
<collocation>cape ray</collocation>
would
stay
in
the
<collocation>mediterranean sea</collocation>
while
the
chemicals
were
being
destroyed
it
could
sail
elsewhere
they
also
refused
to
say
how
the
ship
would
be
protected


no
u
government
workers
will
be
in
syria
to
help
move
the
chemicals
also
no
u
military
forces
will
be
involved
in
protecting
the
syrian
trucks
on
the
way
to
latakia


a
group
called
the
organization
for
the
prohibition
of
<collocation>chemical weapons</collocation>
is
working
with
the
united
nations
to
destroy
the
weapons
the
most
<collocation>dangerous material</collocation>
must
be
removed
from
syria
by
the
end
of
this
year
the
organization
said
the
u
n
says
the
<collocation>entire supply</collocation>
must
be
destroyed
by
mid


the
<collocation>cape ray</collocation>
is
expected
to
be
tested
at
sea
this
month
it
should
be
ready
to
sail
early
next
year


the
ship
will
have
a
lab
it
will
also
have
a
<collocation>protective system</collocation>
the
protection
includes
a
large
tent
the
tent
is
supposed
to
prevent
dangerous
chemicals
from
escaping
the
hold
if
an
accident
occurs
workers
will
<collocation>wear protective</collocation>
suits


the
<collocation>hydrolysis machines</collocation>
get
rid
of
almost
all
of
the
chemicals
they
leave
a
liquid
behind
the
leftover
liquid
is
still
considered
hazardous
but
it
is
not
as
poisonous
one
of
the
u
officials
said
