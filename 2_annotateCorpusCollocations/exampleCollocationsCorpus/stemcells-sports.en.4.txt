c
j
nitkowski
suffered
an
injury
in
after
years
as
a
pitcher
he
hurt
his
left
shoulder
he
was
years
old
and
couldn
t
throw
a
baseball
the
way
he
used
to


he
didn
t
want
to
quit
baseball
so
nitkowski
tried
a
new
type
of
treatment
it
called
<collocation>stem cell</collocation>
therapy
cells
are
the
<collocation>building blocks</collocation>
of
the
<collocation>human body</collocation>
<collocation>stem cell</collocation>
therapy
is
when
<collocation>healthy cells</collocation>
from
one
part
of
your
body
are
used
to
treat
an
illness
and
a
<collocation>hurt muscle</collocation>
in
another
part
of
the
body


nitkowski
felt
better
after
<collocation>stem cell</collocation>
therapy
it
also
helped
him
throw
a
baseball
faster


many
athletes
won
t
talk
about
the
treatment
nitkowski
will
so
other
players
want
to
talk
to
him
about
it


even
though
it
helped
him
nitkowski
still
won
t
tell
other
people
to
use
it
i
can
only
tell
my
story
he
said



<collocation>everybody wants</collocation>
answers


some
people
think
<collocation>stem cell</collocation>
therapy
can
help
many
different
illnesses
this
is
why
<collocation>professional athletes</collocation>
are
so
interested
in
it


players
want
the
best
new
medicine
said
dr
<collocation>jim bradley</collocation>
he
is
the
doctor
for
the
nfl
pittsburgh
steelers


bradley
is
excited
about
what
<collocation>stem cell</collocation>
therapy
can
do
many
people
he
talks
to
don
t
understand
what
it
is
so
he
explains
it
a
lot
<collocation>adult stem</collocation>
cells
are
cells
that
are
the
same
and
are
found
around
the
body
they
can
split
quickly
some
experts
believe
that
<collocation>stem cells</collocation>
can
strengthen
injured
parts
of
the
body
like
a
shoulder


more
study
still
needs
to
be
done
to
know
for
sure



<collocation>everybody wants</collocation>
answers
right
now
and
you
can
t
have
them
right
now
bradley
said


in
the
united
states
the
rules
on
<collocation>stem cell</collocation>
therapy
are
tougher
than
in
other
countries



it
takes
time
to
heal

hospitals
in
europe
australia
and
asia
allow
more
uses
of
stem
therapy


many
athletes
who
go
to
other
countries
for
<collocation>stem cell</collocation>
therapy
do
it
in
secret
