said
ernesto
oroza
born
in
cuba
oroza
has
collected
the
inventions
since
the
mid
he
now
lives
in
miami


they
have
learned
to
make
what
they
need
with
whatever
they
happen
to
have
he
said


since
the
early
cubans
have
been
resolviendo
in

means
making
do
in
cuban
<collocation>leader fidel</collocation>
castro
took
over
the
cuban
government
the
u
did
not
like
castro
it
decided
to
punish
him
the
government
stopped
u
companies
from
doing
business
with
cuba


cuba
couldn
t
buy
goods
from
the
u
it
wasn
t
allowed
to
buy
everything
from
building
materials
to
<collocation>car parts</collocation>
so
cubans
learned
to
make
do



from
dangerous
to
very
smart

castro
had
some
ideas
that
failed
in
he
suggested
breeding
cows
down
to
the
size
of
dogs
he
thought
families
could
keep
them
in
their
back
yards
then
children
could
drink
the
cow
milk
that
was
another
thing
cuba
didn
t
have
enough
of
milk


some
of
the
inventions
were
dangerous


they
<collocation>heated water</collocation>
for
showers
with
electric
wires
connected
to
cans


other
inventions
were
very
smart


an
iron
turned
upside
down
became
a
frying
pan
paper
clips
held
up
a
<collocation>shower curtain</collocation>
a
gallon
<collocation>metal container</collocation>
became
a
pizza
oven
cubans
even
figured
out
how
to
recharge
batteries
that
are
not
chargeable


women
used
colored
<collocation>classroom chalk</collocation>
as
<collocation>face powder</collocation>


there
was
even
a
group
that
encouraged
the
inventions


in
the
cuban
army
and
a
women
group
printed
a
book
on
making
do


a
year
later
they
did
a
second
book
they
proudly
called
it
with
our
own
efforts
