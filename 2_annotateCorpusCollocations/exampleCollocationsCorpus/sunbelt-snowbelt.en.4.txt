<collocation>los angeles</collocation>
california
and
<collocation>new york</collocation>
still
attract
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
from
all
over
the
world
but
the
u
census
bureau
says
that
americans
find
texas
florida
colorado
and
the
carolinas
far
more
appealing


the
census
bureau
counts
the
number
of
people
who
live
in
the
united
states
it
also
tracks
where
they
live
and
move
to
its
latest
report
found
that
states
in
the
southern
and
western
u
helped
the
country
population
grow
the
most
more
babies
were
born
in
those
states
than
in
the
north
and
east
but
the
other
reason
was
more
foreigners
and
newcomers
from
other
states
moved
to
southern
and
western
states


the
study
tracked
these
moves
when
people
move
to
a
new
country
or
state
it
often
to
find
work
or
better
homes
jobs
became
hard
to
find
when
the
recession
began
in
it
was
a
period
when
many
people
lost
their
jobs
and
homes
though
the
recession
ended
in
its
effects
are
still
being
felt


the
census
helped
scientists
see
the
recession
effect
on
movements
from
state
to
state



fewer
americans
moving
south

during
the
recession
that
movement
or
migration
from
state
to
state
decreased
fewer
jobs
were
to
be
had
people
feared
moving
far
from
home


people
saw
little
reason
to
move
then
but
even
though
the
recession
is
over
migration
has
not
gone
back
to
what
it
was


the
census
bureau
tracked
state
to
state
movement
between
july
and
july
results
showed
only
small
signs
of
increased
migration



people
were
sort
of
frozen
in
place
by
the
recession
said
<collocation>kenneth m</collocation>
johnson
he
teaches
at
the
university
of
<collocation>new hampshire</collocation>


johnson
says
that
more
americans
are
moving
than
they
did
a
few
years
ago
but
not
nearly
as
many
as
before
the
recession


before
the
recession
americans
often
moved
from
the
<collocation>snowbelt states</collocation>
for
ones
in
the
sunbelt


the
snowbelt
is
a
region
in
the
northern
part
of
the
united
states
<collocation>chilly states</collocation>
like
minnesota
and
<collocation>new hampshire</collocation>
are
in
the
snowbelt


the
sunbelt
stretches
across
the
southern
and
southwestern
u
it
runs
from
florida
to
california


but
fewer
americans
now
make
that
move
south
young
americans
have
been
particularly
cautious
about
moving



we
re
not
back
to
normal
said
<collocation>william frey</collocation>
he
an
expert
on
population
change
at
the
brookings
institution



to
and
from
california

states
such
as
florida
arizona
and
nevada
used
to
bring
in
people
from
all
over
now
those
states
aren
t
attracting
as
many
people
as
before
the
recession


frey
ran
his
own
study
he
found
that
the
number
of
people
moving
to
states
like
florida
nevada
and
arizona
from
other
states
fell
between
and


before
the
recession
nevada
used
to
draw
more
than
people
a
year
from
different
states
but
during
the
recession
nevada
lost
people
to
other
states


after
the
recession
nevada
still
only
attracts
a
small
number
of
americans
from
other
states


in
places
like
<collocation>new york</collocation>
and
california
immigration
has
been
a
big
help
foreigners
have
immigrated
from
other
countries
to
the
u
their
movement
has
made
up
for
the
loss
of
people
to
other
states


for
example
the
<collocation>northeastern part</collocation>
of
the
country
lost
more
than
people
who
once
lived
there
those
people
moved
to
other
parts
of
the
country


but
the
northeast
gained
more
than
people
in
the
last
year
those
newcomers
traveled
from
different
countries


<collocation>hans johnson</collocation>
is
an
<collocation>immigration expert</collocation>
in
california
he
says
that
california
used
to
be
a
state
that
people
moved
to
from
other
states
and
around
the
world



now
it
a
place
that
receives
people
from
the
rest
of
the
world
johnson
said
and
sends
people
out
to
other
parts
of
the
u
