<collocation>christopher columbus</collocation>
returned
to
europe
from
the
new
world
in
back
then
america
was
known
as
the
new
world


columbus
had
learned
of
many
things
during
his
travels
he
wanted
to
bring
them
back
to
europe


one
of
the
most
exciting
was
a
grain
called
corn


corn
was
delicious
columbus
said
it
could
help
feed
a
lot
of
people


corn
never
did
get
much
popular
in
europe
columbus
did
not
bring
back
the
information
on
how
to
grow
and
cook
it



corn
in
what
we
eat
and
drink

in
the
new
world
things
were
very
different
corn
grew
more
and
more
popular
there
today
it
is
in
many
of
the
things
americans
eat
and
drink


the
united
states
uses
far
more
corn
than
any
other
country
corn
is
in
the
<collocation>sodas americans</collocation>
drink
it
is
in
the
<collocation>potato chips</collocation>
they
munch
on
it
is
in
hamburgers
and
french
fries
it
is
in
bread
and
cereal
it
is
in
almost
all
chicken
and
turkey
corn
is
even
in
most
fish
there
are
more
foods
with
some
corn
in
them
than
there
are
foods
without
any


it
was
not
always
that
way
it
took
time
for
america
to
learn
to
like
corn


at
first
mostly
poor
people
ate
corn
over
time
corn
grew
more
popular
soon
it
was
on
<collocation>dinner tables</collocation>
all
over
the
country



very
little
grown
for
corn
on
the
cob

there
are
three
main
kinds
of
corn


the
first
is
<collocation>sweet corn</collocation>
<collocation>sweet corn</collocation>
is
the
most
loved
kind
of
corn
we
often
eat
it
on
the
cob
it
is
what
most
people
think
of
when
they
hear
the
word
corn
still
very
little
of
the
corn
we
grow
is
<collocation>sweet corn</collocation>


a
second
type
is
called
<collocation>flint corn</collocation>
<collocation>flint corn</collocation>
is
the
kind
of
corn
used
to
make
popcorn
not
much
of
the
corn
grown
here
is
<collocation>flint corn</collocation>


then
there
is
<collocation>dent corn</collocation>
it
is
the
most
important
kind
by
far
most
of
the
corn
grown
in
america
today
is
<collocation>dent corn</collocation>


<collocation>dent corn</collocation>
does
not
show
up
on
the
<collocation>dinner table</collocation>
it
is
fed
to
animals
like
cows
chicken
and
pigs

americans
do
eat
a
lot
of
<collocation>dent corn</collocation>
without
even
knowing
it
though
<collocation>dent corn</collocation>
is
in
most
of
the
animals
we
eat
it
is
in
their
bodies
because
<collocation>farmers feed</collocation>
it
to
them
<collocation>dent corn</collocation>
is
also
added
to
many
drinks
as
a
sweetener


today
corn
makes
up
a
huge
part
of
what
americans
eat
it
is
everywhere
even
if
we
often
do
not
notice
it
corn
has
come
a
<collocation>long way</collocation>
since
the
days
of
columbus
