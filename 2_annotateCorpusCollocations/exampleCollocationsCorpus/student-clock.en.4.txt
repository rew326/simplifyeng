lawmakers
are

it

they
cannot
use
laws
from
other
countries
or
religions
it
would
include
shariah
which
is
muslim
law
some
people
are
against
this
law
they
think
the
law
is
not
necessary
they
say
the
law
comes
from
anti
muslim
feelings
earlier
this
spring
the
<collocation>city council</collocation>
members
of
<collocation>irving thought</collocation>
the
law
was
a
<collocation>good idea</collocation>
and
gave
their
approval
