the
<collocation>cuban crocodile</collocation>
was
already
very
rare
now
it
is
facing
a
new
danger
scientists
say


the
problem
is
that
many
cuban
crocodiles
do
not
mate
with
each
other
instead
they
have
been
mating
with
american
crocodiles


cuban
and
american
crocodiles
have
been
mating
quite
a
bit
their
offspring
are
a
mix
of
the
two
types


cuban
and
american
crocodiles
are
considered
<collocation>separate kinds</collocation>
of
animals
or
species
the
reason
is
that
each
has
its
own
set
of
genes
genes
are
the
body
instructions
they
are
passed
down
from
parent
to
child
<collocation>genes shape</collocation>
how
living
things
look
and
behave



genes
have
<collocation>many roles</collocation>

in
humans
for
example
there
is
a
gene
for
<collocation>red hair</collocation>
in
cuban
crocodiles
there
are
genes
that
make
them
what
they
are
a
species
<collocation>complete set</collocation>
of
genes
is
called
a
genome


when
two
different
<collocation>species mate</collocation>
scientists
call
it
interbreeding


interbreeding
is
causing
the
cuban
species
to
change
its
genome
is
becoming
more
mixed
in
each
baby
some
cuban
genes
are
replaced
by
american
<collocation>crocodile genes</collocation>
with
each
new
generation
more
and
more
cuban
genes
are
lost


eventually
the
species
could
disappear



they
already
knew

scientists
already
knew
the
two
species
were
breeding
together
now
they
know
just
how
much
it
is
happening


a
team
of
scientists
led
by
yoamel
mili
n
garc
a
made
the
discovery
the
team
studied
genes
found
in
the
scales
of
<collocation>wild crocodiles</collocation>
what
they
saw
proved
that
interbreeding
was
happening
a
lot
nearly
half
of
the
crocodiles
had
<collocation>mixed genes</collocation>


the
<collocation>cuban crocodile</collocation>
was
once
common
however
hunting
killed
many
today
there
are
only
around
left


now
the
<collocation>cuban crocodile</collocation>
could
disappear
altogether
its
genome
may
take
in
too
many
american
<collocation>crocodile genes</collocation>
if
that
happens
it
will
no
longer
be
a
separate
species



careful
study
of
crocodiles

american
crocodiles
are
not
in
the
same
kind
of
danger
there
are
many
more
of
them
around
their
genes
will
not
disappear


scientists
say
the
<collocation>cuban crocodile</collocation>
is
special
they
believe
it
is
worth
protecting


mili
n
garc
a
is
trying
to
figure
out
what
causes
the
interbreeding
he
suspects
the
reason
is
hunting
and
the
disappearance
of
swamps
and
marshes
both
are
driving
the
two
species
into
the
same
areas
the
two
types
of
crocodile
are
now
much
more
likely
to
interbreed


mili
n
garc
a
team
did
not
only
look
at
<collocation>wild crocodiles</collocation>
they
also
studied
<collocation>captive cuban</collocation>
crocodiles


those
animals
live
at
the
zapata
swamp
captive
breeding
farm
they
are
kept
apart
from
american
crocodiles
a
study
of
their
genes
gave
scientists
some
good
news


about
of
the
animals
still
had
the
special
genes
of
the
<collocation>cuban crocodile</collocation>
in
the
future
those
animals
could
be
very
important
they
may
help
keep
the
<collocation>cuban crocodile</collocation>
from
disappearing
