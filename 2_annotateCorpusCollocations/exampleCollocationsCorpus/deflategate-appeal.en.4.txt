two
football
teams
played
a
big
game
last
winter
the
teams
were
the
new
<collocation>england patriots</collocation>
and
the
indianapolis
colts
the
colts
said
they
thought
the
footballs
did
not
feel
right


the
<collocation>national football</collocation>
league
nfl
tested
the
footballs
at
halftime
and
discovered
that
they
were
low
on
air


letting
air
out
makes
the
footballs
easier
to
throw
and
catch
letting
too
much
air
out
is
against
the
nfl
rules
it
called
cheating


the
patriots
won
the
game
against
the
colts
two
weeks
later
the
<collocation>patriots beat</collocation>
the
<collocation>seattle seahawks</collocation>
in
the
<collocation>super bowl</collocation>



punishment
still
stands

in
may
the
nfl
said
<collocation>tom brady</collocation>
probably
knew
about
the
air
getting
let
out
of
the
footballs
he
is
the
patriots
<collocation>star quarterback</collocation>
the
nfl
ruled
that
brady
could
not
play
the
first
four
games
this
year
brady
appealed
which
means
he
asked
the
nfl
to
let
him
play


<collocation>roger goodell</collocation>
is
the
<collocation>nfl commissioner</collocation>
and
is
in
charge
of
the
<collocation>football league</collocation>
he
said
the
punishment
still
stands


now
brady
will
likely
go
to
court
and
ask
a
judge
to
let
him
play


goodell
gave
out
new
information
on
tuesday
brady
knew
<collocation>football officials</collocation>
wanted
his
cellphone
the
officials
thought
it
might
contain
important
information
but
brady
had
his
cellphone
destroyed
soon
before
the
meeting
with
the
officials


goodell
said
he
<collocation>respects brady</collocation>
as
a
<collocation>football player</collocation>
still
brady
hurt
the
honesty
of
the
game
goodell
said
now
people
think
that
players
cheat



going
to
a
judge

<collocation>don yee</collocation>
is
brady
agent
he
said
goodell
decision
was
not
fair


yee
said
that
brady
gave
goodell
new
information
this
information
showed
brady
was
not
involved
goodell
ignored
the
evidence
yee
said


the
<collocation>nfl players</collocation>
association
nflpa
is
a
group
that
represents
football
players
<collocation>football officials</collocation>
and
the
nflpa
had
a
talk
about
brady
they
did
not
make
much
progress
the
nflpa
did
not
think
brady
should
sit
out
any
games
<collocation>football officials</collocation>
said
brady
had
to
be
punished


now
brady
and
the
nflpa
will
ask
a
judge
to
let
brady
play


some
say
they
have
a
good
chance
of
winning


many
in
the
nfl
though
do
not
think
brady
should
play



a
different
quarterback

if
brady
cannot
play
jimmy
garoppolo
would
be
the
quarterback
for
the
first
four
games
of
the
football
season
garoppolo
does
not
have
much
experience
he
began
playing
with
the
patriots
just
last
year


the
first
football
game
of
the
season
is
sept
the
patriots
will
play
the
pittsburgh
steelers
