one
of

in

was
her
friends
were
getting
into
trouble
they
got
into
gangs
and
tried
drugs
jones
wanted
to
keep
herself
off
the
streets


she
joined
a
<collocation>drill team</collocation>
run
by
the
city
she
was
the
<collocation>oldest member</collocation>
surrounded
by
kids
half
her
age
they
looked
to
jones
as
their
leader
but
then
the
city
ran
out
of
money
for
the
team
parents
asked
jones
to
start
a
new
one
so
she
did
it
called
the
sophisticated
sisters
<collocation>drill team</collocation>


the
team
used
to
practice
under
highways
but
it
has
grown
to
perform
on
dancing
with
the
stars
jones
and
her
husband
robert
give
camden
children
a
safe
place
to
be



practicing
their
steps

recently
members
of
the
<collocation>drill team</collocation>
gathered
inside
a
<collocation>water tower</collocation>
girls
and
a
few
boys
laughed
and
practiced
dance
moves
and
cartwheels
a
man
pulled
drums
from
a
storage
space


the
<collocation>water tower</collocation>
is
in
a
dangerous
part
of
camden



<collocation>jones stands</collocation>
in
the
center



get
ready
jones
yelled
cheerfully
her
voice
soared
over
the
noise


the
crowd
fell
silent



one
line
jones
hollered


three
<collocation>dozen pairs</collocation>
of
feet
shuffled
across
the
<collocation>concrete floor</collocation>
the
kids
organized
themselves
they
stood
from
tallest
to
smallest
they
did
it
with
speed
that
comes
from
practicing


then
jones
sent
them
marching
she
adjusted
their
arms
she
fixed
their
shoulders
she
made
them
stand
up
straight
as
they
stomped
across
the
room
they
followed
the
<collocation>thunderous beat</collocation>
of
the
drum


<collocation>jones spotted</collocation>
someone
chewing
gum
she
ordered
the
girl
to
spit
it
out
she
swooped
down
to
pick
up
a
pair
of
eyeglasses
that
had
flown
off
the
face
of
a
marcher
she
yelled
advice
orders
and
praise

relies
on
people
giving
money
to
help
pay
for
what
the
team
needs
practices
take
place
in
the
empty
old
<collocation>water tower</collocation>
the
team
has
members
there
isn
t
enough
room

of
them
in
the
tower
so
jones
splits
up
the
practice

nights
a
week
for

groups


each
practice
seems
to
bring
a
new
problem
