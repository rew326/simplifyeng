u
<collocation>president barack</collocation>
obama
said
wednesday
that
the
world
needs
to
punish
<collocation>bashar assad</collocation>
the
syrian
president
supposedly
ordered
a
<collocation>poison gas</collocation>
attack
on
his
people
obama
said
if
assad
is
not
punished
other
leaders
will
not
take
<collocation>future warnings</collocation>
seriously


the
<collocation>middle eastern</collocation>
country
of
syria
is
fighting
a
<collocation>civil war</collocation>
assad
is
trying
to
hold
on
to
power
as
rebels
try
to
force
him
out
thousands
of
people
have
been
killed
many
of
those
killed
were
not
part
of
the
war


obama
said
a
year
ago
that
assad
would
be
crossing
a
<collocation>red line</collocation>
if
he
used
<collocation>poison gas</collocation>
he
did
not
make
up
the
<collocation>red line</collocation>
obama
said
wednesday
the
whole
world
decides
what
is
not
acceptable
he
explained


president
obama
was
speaking
in
sweden
he
stopped
there
before
heading
to
russia
for
a
meeting
of
world
leaders


obama
is
trying
to
get
other
countries
to
agree
with
u
plans
to
use
missiles
to
punish
assad
government
the
united
states
says
it
is
sure
that
assad
forces
were
behind
a
gas
attack
on
aug
near
syria
capital
more
than
people
were
killed
some
of
them
were
children



assad
was
warned
obama
says

like
the
boy
who
cried
wolf
obama
argues
that
if
you
say
something
over
and
over
and
it
doesn
t
come
true
people
stop
listening
in
this
case
he
says
that
assad
was
warned
he
would
be
punished
if
he
used
<collocation>poison gas</collocation>
to
do
nothing
would
mean
the
world
is
going
back
on
its
word
he
explained



what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
the
president
asked
about
the
innocent
people
who
were
poisoned


but
not
many
countries
support
obama
plan
to
<collocation>fire missiles</collocation>
at
syria
at
least
not
yet
some
are
worried
about
getting
into
another
war
in
the
area
without
knowing
the
facts
they
say
this
happened
in
the
iraq
war


the
united
nations
is
still
<collocation>testing samples</collocation>
from
syria
it
plans
to
say
if
<collocation>poison gas</collocation>
was
used
but
it
will
not
say
which
sides
used
it


sweden
<collocation>leader fredrik</collocation>
reinfeldt
said
his
country
wants
the
united
nations
to
be
involved
it
also
wants
to
solve
the
<collocation>civil war</collocation>
through
talks
or
elections
it
does
not
want
a
<collocation>military solution</collocation>



this
small
country
will
always
say
let
put
our
hope
into
the
united
nations
let
us
push
on
some
more
to
get
a
better
situation
reinfeldt
said
he
was
at
the
same
<collocation>news conference</collocation>
as
president
obama



russia
says
u
needs
u
n
approval

obama
says
there
is
no
doubt
that
<collocation>poison gas</collocation>
was
used
by
assad
government
he
also
pointed
out
that
he
was
against
the
war
in
iraq



i
m
not
interested
in
repeating
mistakes
by
using
bad
information
obama
said


russian
<collocation>president vladimir</collocation>
putin
warned
the
united
states
against
<collocation>firing missiles</collocation>
at
syria
the
united
states
should
get
u
n
approval
first
he
said
putin
was
speaking
to
the
associated
press


russia
usually
stops
the
united
nations
from
punishing
syria
putin
said
he
could
agree
to
a
punishment
this
time
but
the
u
n
has
to
prove
that
syria
used
<collocation>poison gas</collocation>


obama
canceled
a
meeting
he
was
supposed
to
have
with
putin
in
russia
the
president
is
meeting
with
the
leaders
of
japan
china
and
france



an
uneasy
relationship

the
<collocation>white house</collocation>
said
obama
and
putin
should
still
have
a
chance
to
talk


putin
has
a
<collocation>frosty relationship</collocation>
obama
but
he
tried
not
to
let
it
show
russia
experts
have
said
it
is
one
of
the
worst
ever
between
u
and
russian
leaders



president
obama
hasn
t
been
elected
by
the
american
people
in
order
to
be
pleasant
to
russia
putin
said
nor
was
he
elected
by
the
russian
people
just
to
be
pleasant
he
added



we
work
we
argue
about
some
issues
we
are
human
but
the
two
countries
have
interests
in
common
around
the
world
to
find
solutions
to
their
problems
he
said
