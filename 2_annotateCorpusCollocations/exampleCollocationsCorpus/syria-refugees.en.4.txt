and
for

with
her
family

she
is
a
refugee
like
all
the
others
living

would
make

<collocation>president bashar</collocation>
assad
more
brave
he
might
even
<collocation>attack zaatari</collocation>
they
said
the
camp
is

zoubi
has
lived
in
the
camp
for
the
past
year
it
is
a
<collocation>dusty place</collocation>
and
sits
in
the
hot
sun
the
camp
is
made
up
of
tents
and
<collocation>metal huts</collocation>


u
officials
said
<collocation>last week</collocation>
they
believed
the
assad
government
ordered
an
aug
<collocation>poison gas</collocation>
attack
it
took
place
in
a
town
near
damascus
<collocation>rebels control</collocation>
the
town
at
least
people
who
were
not
soldiers
were
killed


u
secretary
of
<collocation>state john</collocation>
kerry
said
sunday
that
evidence
showed
<collocation>sarin gas</collocation>
was
used
the
deadly
<collocation>poison gas</collocation>
can
be
inhaled
or
absorbed
through
the
skin
u
n
inspectors
have
not
confirmed
if
sarin
was
used
they
are
still
<collocation>testing samples</collocation>
collected
in
syria
<collocation>last week</collocation>


people
in
the
camp
heard
obama
decision
on
arabic
language
<collocation>television channels</collocation>



everybody
was
watching
said
zoubi



don
t
understand
u
politics

more
than
people
live
in
the
camp
many
did
not
understand
why
obama
decided
to
ask
congress
for
permission
most
americans
do
not
want
the
united
states
to
get
involved
in
syria
but
the
people
in
zaatari
come
from
a
country
where
that
would
not
matter
syria
has
been
controlled
by
just
one
family
for
more
than
years


obama
<collocation>decision delays</collocation>
any
<collocation>military strike</collocation>
but
some
in
<collocation>congress doubt</collocation>
that
obama
can
get
permission
at
all


fadil
issa
said
many
refugees
think
obama
called
off
the
u
strikes
because
it
would
have
started
a
fight
with
iran
the
country
is
one
of
assad
<collocation>main allies</collocation>



people
are
unhappy
by
this
postponement
they
don
t
understand
why
he
afraid
of
iran
he
said
of
obama


some
people
were
also
unhappy
with
life
at
the
camp
they
were
willing
to
return
to
syria
they
think
it
is
worth
the
danger
to
go
back
home



some
going
back
home

many
men
women
and
children
waited
in
the
heat
late
one
afternoon
they
would
get
on
buses
that
would
leave
them
near
the
border
from
there
they
were
to
walk
to
<collocation>syrian territory</collocation>
controlled
by
rebels
of
the
free
syrian
army


seats
on
the
buses
are
limited
it
first
come
first
served
so
the
crowd
charged
the
vehicles
as
they
pulled
up
people
pushed
and
shoved
through
the
doors
their
possessions
were
stuffed
in
<collocation>cloth bundles</collocation>
and
<collocation>old suitcases</collocation>


<collocation>jordanian police</collocation>
forces
in
three
armored
cars
stood
by
and
just
watched
they
were
on
guard
against
<collocation>serious trouble</collocation>
not
pushing
and
shoving


a
truck
hauling
a
trailer
with
<collocation>windows cut</collocation>
into
its
sides
came
before
the
buses
it
appeared
to
be
bringing
<collocation>rebel fighters</collocation>
back
into
syria
only
men
and
<collocation>teenage boys</collocation>
swarmed
into
the
trailer



it
unbearable
to
live
here
said
hafiz
as
she
watched
the
scene
several
of
her
daughters
were
by
her
side
even
with
<collocation>rocket explosions</collocation>
it
better
over
there
we
re
not
afraid
whatever
allah
has
written
for
us
will
happen
