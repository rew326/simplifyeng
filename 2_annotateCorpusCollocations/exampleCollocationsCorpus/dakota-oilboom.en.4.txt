williston
n
d
an
<collocation>oil boom</collocation>
is
going
on
in
<collocation>north dakota</collocation>
and
with
the
tough
<collocation>job market</collocation>
people
are
coming
from
all
over
to
work
there


<collocation>andrew klefstad</collocation>
has
been
working
in
the
<collocation>bakken oil</collocation>
fields
of
<collocation>north dakota</collocation>
for
four
years
like
many
other
people
he
lives
somewhere
else
when
he
not
working
he
goes
back
to
his
family
in
wisconsin


one
early
morning
in
wisconsin
he
milks
the
cows
in
his
father
barn
then
he
fixes
up
his
family
home


but
at
p
m
he
has
to
take
a
train
back
to
<collocation>north dakota</collocation>
his
wife
tiffany
kisses
him
goodbye
after
driving
miles
to
the
<collocation>train station</collocation>



a
<collocation>long way</collocation>
from
home

he
grabs
a
seat
on
the
train
it
a
hour
<collocation>train ride</collocation>
to
the
<collocation>bakken oil</collocation>
fields
many
more
people
do
this
<collocation>train ride</collocation>
since
the
oil
business
became
big
in
<collocation>north dakota</collocation>


klefstad
is
foot
and
pounds
his
arms
are
covered
with
angel
tattoos
he
wears
a
bracelet
his
year
old
son
made
he
sent
it
to
<collocation>north dakota</collocation>
with
a
letter
saying
come
home
dad



i
was
like
four
days
away
from
coming
home
klefstad
recalled
later
i
just
started
bawling


but
at
the
<collocation>oil fields</collocation>
there
are
lots
of
jobs
paying
a
lot
of
money


young
men
like
klefstad
are
pouring
into
these
fields
they
re
coming
because
the
science
of
fracturing
has
changed
the
oil
business
<collocation>fracturing means</collocation>
using
water
and
chemicals
to
break
through
rock
to
get
to
oil
below
the
process
is
also
called
fracking
it
now
possible
to
reach
oil
miles
deep
in
<collocation>north dakota</collocation>
by
fracking


klefstad
and
people
like
him
work
the
<collocation>oil fields</collocation>
for
a
few
weeks
then
head
back
to
their
homes
and
then
they
do
it
all
over
again



making
a
lot
of
money

but
for
klefstad
and
other
workers
the
chance
at
a
good
job
has
some
drawbacks


like
many
klefstad
came
because
jobs
are
hard
to
find
his
father
couldn
t
pay
him
back
on
the
<collocation>dairy farm</collocation>
and
business
slowed
down
at
the
company
he
worked
for
in
minnesota


so
he
set
off
for
<collocation>north dakota</collocation>
he
found
a
job
quickly
now
at
only
with
no
<collocation>college degree</collocation>
he
earning
more
than
a
year
he
cleaning
up
<collocation>oil spills</collocation>
and
washing
sludge
off
trucks


klefstad
says
he
out
here
only
until
his
loans
are
paid
off


and
he
has
done
well
for
himself
he
has
more
than
a
dozen
people
working
for
him



a
hard
morning
work

on
this
<collocation>sunday morning</collocation>
he
steering
his
huge
<collocation>supersucker truck</collocation>
through
the
<collocation>vast oil</collocation>
fields
of
the
bakken
it
covers
roughly
<collocation>square miles</collocation>
about
the
size
of
<collocation>west virginia</collocation>
it
even
goes
into
canada


fracking
has
put
<collocation>north dakota</collocation>
just
behind
texas
in
getting
the
most
oil
out
of
the
ground
with
all
of
the
new
workers
it
the
fastest
growing
state
in
the
country


<collocation>klefstad pulls</collocation>
up
to
a
<collocation>giant truck</collocation>
wash
dozens
of
<collocation>trucks drop</collocation>
tons
of
sludge
into
the
underground
pit
below


he
steps
into
a
yellow
jumpsuit
to
be
safe
a
worker
connects
a
<collocation>giant hose</collocation>
to
the
<collocation>supersucker truck</collocation>


klefstad
goes
into
the
pit
he
attached
to
a
cable
that
could
pull
him
out
if
things
go
wrong


he
uses
the
hose
to
suck
the
<collocation>oil waste</collocation>
into
his
<collocation>supersucker truck</collocation>
it
will
later
go
into
a
landfill


the
work
takes
hours
klefstad
finally
comes
out
his
jumpsuit
covered
in
sludge
but
he
grinning



maybe
it
the
level
of
danger
but
i
do
love
it
he
says
