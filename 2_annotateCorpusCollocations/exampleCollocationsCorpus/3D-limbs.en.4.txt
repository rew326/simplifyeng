its
website
using
them
families
can
print
their
own
hands


the
d
printed
hands
are
really
useful
for
children
children
grow
quickly
they
become
too
big
for
their
old
hands
replacements
are
expensive
parents
may
not
be
able
to
pay
for
a
new
one
every
few
months
or
few
years


the
d

also
weigh
less
they
are
easier
for
kids
to
use

come
in
their
<collocation>favorite colors</collocation>
griffin
wanted
his
hand
to
glow
in
the
dark



putting
hands
together
like
legos

to
print
a
hand
<collocation>plastic sheets</collocation>
are
fed
into
a
machine
they
melt
and
the
plastic
comes
out
in
layers
they
look
like
legos
the
pieces
are
fitted
together


hand
pieces
take
up
to
hours
to
print
putting
them
together
takes
another
couple
of
hours
kids
can
make
the
<collocation>hands grasp</collocation>
objects
