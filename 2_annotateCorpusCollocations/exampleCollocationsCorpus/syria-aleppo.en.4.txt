aleppo
syria
the
<collocation>middle eastern</collocation>
country
of
syria
has
been
in
a
<collocation>civil war</collocation>
for
almost
three
years
<collocation>rebel forces</collocation>
are
fighting
against
armies
loyal
to
the
country
<collocation>president bashar</collocation>
assad
aleppo
and
its
suburbs
are
controlled
by
the
rebels


one
late
night
a
family
stood
shivering
on
a
balcony
in
anadan
a
town
near
aleppo
they
were
awakened
by
the
nightly
flight
of
a
government
helicopter


they
followed
the
sound
of
the
helicopter
blades
they
also
listened
to
scratchy
updates
from
rebels
on
a
walkie
talkie


the
helicopter
had
dropped
two
<collocation>barrel bombs</collocation>
on
nearby
towns
the
bombs
are
very
strong
and
can
bring
down
buildings


the
family
knew
that
the
helicopters
can
carry
up
to
four
of
these
<collocation>deadly bombs</collocation>
they
waited
for
the
last
two


lights
came
on
in
basement
bunkers
where
others
went
for
protection
khansa
laila
walked
out
onto
the
balcony
she
was
wearing
layers
of
clothing
still
she
shivered
in
the
cold



i
woke
up
from
the
sound
of
the
alarm
so
i
m
still
cold
she
said
also
fear
makes
you
cold


<collocation>red streaks</collocation>
from
a
<collocation>machine gun</collocation>
shot
upward
against
a
<collocation>starry sky</collocation>
but
the
streaks
rose
and
fell
without
striking
their
target


eventually
the
sound
of
the
helicopter
became
softer
it
was
replaced
by
the
sound
of
a
warplane



we
don
t
take
the
warplanes
seriously
anymore
laila
said
warplanes
<collocation>launch rockets</collocation>
that
hit
one
target
she
said
but
<collocation>helicopters drop</collocation>
<collocation>barrel bombs</collocation>
that
can
destroy
dozens
of
homes
with
one
barrel


the
family
went
to
sleep
that
night
to
the
sound
of
gunfire
and
rockets



city
scary
scenery

the
noise
of
war
has
become
part
of
life
in
aleppo
syria
largest
city


<collocation>government forces</collocation>
have
dropped
<collocation>barrel bombs</collocation>
almost
every
day
some
say
that
more
than
people
have
been
killed
in
these
attacks


those
still
in
the
city
have
adjusted
to
being
the
president
target


in
a
<collocation>shoe store</collocation>
a
woman
tries
on
a
pair
of
wedge
heels
she
decides
that
they
are
not
comfortable
enough
to
run
away
in


hours
earlier
a
<collocation>barrel bomb</collocation>
had
struck
a
street
it
hit
three
vehicles
and
killed
eight
people


the
next
day
people
walked
by
without
a
glance
the
destroyed
vehicles
had
become
just
another
part
of
the
city
scary
scenery



every
day
we
see
the
names
of
the
dead
scrolling
across
the
tv
screen
one
man
said
they
ve
just
become
numbers


a
warplane
low
rumble
stopped
conversation
at
aleppo
<collocation>vegetable market</collocation>


people
forgot
about
the
unripe
almonds
and
lettuce
everyone
turned
their
faces
to
the
sky
to
track
the
plane
by
its
sound


people
waited
for
the
rumble
to
fade
it
was
now
over
another
<collocation>aleppo neighborhood</collocation>



poundings
by
<collocation>big guns</collocation>
too

a
couple
of
burnt
cars
mark
the
entrance
of
the
city


the
helicopters
attack
day
and
night
those
attacks
are
coupled
with
poundings
by
warplanes
and
<collocation>big guns</collocation>
there
are
also
<collocation>regular battles</collocation>
between
government
and
<collocation>rebel forces</collocation>
the
war
has
changed
the
once
vibrant
business
center
into
one
with
<collocation>entire neighborhoods</collocation>
deserted


people
say
that
more
than
two
thirds
of
the
city
people
have
left
and
gone
north
they
go
to
turkey
if
they
are
not
allowed
into
that
country
they
stay
along
its
border
in
<collocation>rundown tents</collocation>


as
one
<collocation>aleppo resident</collocation>
said
of
the
city
there
are
fighters
activists
and
<collocation>shop owners</collocation>
no
one
else
is
left
