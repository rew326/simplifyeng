washington
d
c
government
scientists
have
discovered
a
confusing
new
illness
it
is
like
cancer
which
can
spread
through
a
person
body
they
found
it
in
a
man
who
was
years
old
they
believe
the
man
got
sick
after
he
had
a
stomach
problem


the
man
stomach
problem
was
caused
by
a
parasite
a
parasite
is
a
living
thing
that
feeds
off
a
person
or
animal
in
this
case
the
parasite
was
a
tapeworm


it
was
the
first
time
scientists
had
seen
this
problem
they
had
never
seen
cancer
spread
from
a
parasite
to
a
person



<collocation>sick man</collocation>
lived
in
south
america

the
man
who
got
sick
was
from
south
america
he
lived
in
a
country
called
colombia


doctors
in
colombia
did
not
understand
the
man
illness
he
had
<collocation>small growths</collocation>
in
his
body
they
are
called
tumors
in
some
ways
the
tumors
acted
like
cancer
in
other
ways
they
did
not


the
doctors
needed
help
they
asked
a
government
health
group
in
the
united
states
called
the
cdc


doctors
at
the
cdc
studied
tumors
from
the
man
body
they
were
surprised
to
learn
that
the
tumors
contained
dna
from
a
tapeworm
dna
is
the
building
block
of
life


scientists
think
the
<collocation>colombian man</collocation>
may
have
eaten
<collocation>tiny tapeworm</collocation>
eggs
they
were
probably
inside
food
that
was
not
clean
the
tapeworms
multiplied
in
his
body



case
raises
worries
about
cancer

the
<collocation>case worries</collocation>
scientists
for
many
reasons


until
now
scientists
did
not
think
a
tapeworm
could
have
cancer
they
also
did
not
think
tapeworms
could
spread
cancer
to
people


by
the
time
doctors
figured
out
what
was
wrong
with
the
man
it
was
too
late
the
man
died
it
was
hard
to
study
his
case
after
he
died


tapeworms
are
very
common
doctors
do
not
know
if
this
<collocation>tapeworm cancer</collocation>
illness
is
common
they
say
they
need
to
study
it
more
