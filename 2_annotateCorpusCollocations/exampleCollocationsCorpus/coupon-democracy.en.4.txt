seattle
wash
when
people
want
to
make
a
difference
most
of
them
vote
they
can
elect
leaders
who
change
things
now
one
city
is
giving
people
another
way
each
person
is
getting
one
hundred
dollars
people
can
give
the
money
to
people
they
support


the
program
is
in
seattle
it
is
a
city
in
<collocation>washington state</collocation>
voters
will
get
four
vouchers
or
coupons
they
can
use
in
an
election
each
is
worth
the
vouchers
make
it
easier
for
everyday
people
to
get
more
involved
in
politics



giving
everyone
a
voice


we
re
very
eager
to
see
how
it
works
said
<collocation>michael malin</collocation>
he
runs
a
group
that
is
trying
to
make
elections
more
fair


malin
said
that
right
now
politics
are
controlled
by
too
few
people
the
rich
have
more
money
to
give
they
can
influence
who
runs
in
elections
now
this
program
helps
everyone
have
a
voice



<collocation>raising taxes</collocation>
to
offer
vouchers

seattle
plan
is
not
cheap
the
money
for
vouchers
has
to
come
from
somewhere
so
seattle
voters
decided
to
<collocation>raise taxes</collocation>
taxes
come
out
of
the
money
that
people
earn
at
their
jobs
people
also
pay
taxes
on
how
much
their
homes
are
worth
taxes
are
how
the
government
pays
for
things
taxes
pay
for
things
like
roads
schools
and
playgrounds
taxes
will
also
pay
for
vouchers


many
people
support
this
idea
they
think
seattle
program
will
help
more
people
make
a
difference
supporters
also
hope
other
cities
will
follow
seattle
lead



fair
or
foul


not
everyone
is
so
sure


some
people
think
the
vouchers
might
not
help
all
candidates
in
the
same
way
they
think
the
program
is
not
fair
they
believe
the
vouchers
make
it
harder
for
new
candidates
in
an
election
new
candidates
might
not
be
ready
to
accept
the
money
coming
from
vouchers


alan
durning
came
up
with
the
plan
he
does
not
agree
with
the
problems
people
have
with
it
durning
thinks
that
money
to
help
candidates
is
a
good
thing
the
vouchers
make
things
more
equal
he
said
they
can
help
all
candidates
get
ahead


in
the
past
not
many
<collocation>seattle voters</collocation>
have
given
money
to
campaigns
in
fewer
than
two
of
every
people
gave
money
in
<collocation>seattle elections</collocation>
people
who
support
the
program
want
more
voters
to
donate
the
vouchers
make
that
easier
they
say
that
vouchers
give
everyone
a
chance
