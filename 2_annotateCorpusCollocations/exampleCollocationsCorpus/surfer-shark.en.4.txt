out

a
few
feet
from

he
did
not
think
anything
of
it
he
went
out
a
little
farther


then
he
felt
it
a
foot
long
<collocation>shark bit</collocation>
his
right
arm


he
looked
down
at
his
arm
he
could
see
the
bite
marks



i
knew
for
sure
it
was
a
shark
he
said
i
was
in
<collocation>complete shock</collocation>



he
still
wants
to
surf

three
days
later
ryan
is
thinking
about
the
attack
he
said
he
will
not
let
it
stop
him



i
do
not
ever
want
to
ever
stop
surfing
he
said
ryan
began
surfing
when
he
was
years
old
he
also
teaches
people
how
to
surf
he
is
now


right
before
the
attack
he
was
at
the
beach
he
was
hanging
out
with
his
surfer
buddies
his
sister
<collocation>amanda shapiro</collocation>
was
taking
pictures
she
is


amanda
was
pointing
her
camera
at
the
sea
suddenly
she
heard
screams
and
calls
for
help


she
saw
other
surfers
help
her
brother
from
the
water
his
arm
was
above
his
head
people
rushed
over
to
help


amanda
called
their
mom



you
do
not
think
this
is
ever
going
to
happen
their
mom
said



sharks
do
not
always
bite

<collocation>shark attacks</collocation>
are
very
rare
there
are
just
to
attacks
on
people
each
year


ryan
remembers
the
feeling
after
the
<collocation>shark attack</collocation>


his
<collocation>arm hurt</collocation>
he
thought
about
just
one
thing
he
wondered
if
he
would
surf
again


on
tuesday
ryan
was
back
on
the
beach
he
watched
his
<collocation>friends surf</collocation>
soon
he
will
be
with
them
in
the
water



i
am
not
scared
he
said
it
was
not
the
shark
fault
or
anything
i
am
just
trying
to
get
more
people
to
be
aware
of
the
water
