sacramento
calif
<collocation>dave vierra</collocation>
started
small
he
planted
his
first
<collocation>corn maze</collocation>
years
ago
it
was
meant
to
be
a
sideshow
his
main
business
was
his
<collocation>popular pumpkin</collocation>
patch
in
<collocation>west sacramento</collocation>
the
maze
covered
just
half
an
acre
about
half
the
size
of
a
<collocation>football field</collocation>


but
just
like
field
corn
it
quickly
grew
and
grew
now
he
has
two
<collocation>corn mazes</collocation>
the
other
acre
maze
is
haunted
for
<collocation>weekend tours</collocation>
zombies
and
other
characters
provide
fright
filled
fun


there
is
more
to
do
at
<collocation>vierra farms</collocation>
than
just
navigate
through
mazes
kids
can
jump
on
a
huge
air
filled
pillow
they
can
play
in
a
giant
corn
box
it
the
same
idea
as
a
sandbox
only
this
one
is
filled
with
dried
corn
the
cornival
also
offers
pig
races
pony
and
<collocation>hay rides</collocation>
look
out
for
the
pumpkin
chuckin
cannon
it
shoots
the
orange
gourds
feet
into
the
air



it
all
the
stuff
we
used
to
do
as
kids
said
vierra
a
lifelong
farmer
as
a
kid
you
walked
into
the
cornfield
at
night
and
a
friend
would
jump
out
to
try
and
scare
you
you
d
jump
into
a
pile
of
straw
or
climb
on
top
of
haystacks
who
doesn
t
like
that
it
all
about
<collocation>fun activities</collocation>
involving
farming



helping
<collocation>family farms</collocation>
survive

agritainment
is
big
business
on
small
<collocation>family farms</collocation>
agri
refers
to
agriculture
and
tainment
refers
to
entertainment
the
idea
is
to
<collocation>turn agriculture</collocation>
into
entertainment
for
non
farming
folks
<collocation>few activities</collocation>
are
more
popular
than
<collocation>corn mazes</collocation>
the
attraction
also
brings
in
big
money


<collocation>family farms</collocation>
are
struggling
right
now
says
kamille
combs
she
works
for
maize
inc
the
company
creates
hundreds
of
<collocation>mazes nationwide</collocation>
during
<collocation>halloween season</collocation>
in
fact
the
company
built
the
mazes
at
dave
pumpkin
patch


combs
says
most
of
the
people
she
works
with
are
family
farmers
they
have
lived
on
their
land
for
years
they
are
trying
to
make
money
so
they
don
t
lose
the
land
still
starting
a
<collocation>corn maze</collocation>
can
be
risky
they
are
a
lot
of
work
to
build
farmers
can
never
be
sure
if
they
will
make
enough
money
on
one
to
cover
their
costs


still
the
<collocation>corn maze</collocation>
craze
has
produced
businesses
many
of
them
specialize
in
building
and
operating
mazes
utah
based
maize
leads
that
list
the
company
has
built
more
than
mazes
maize
negotiates
prices
with
each
farm
<collocation>vierra farms</collocation>
paid
under
for
its
two
mazes



we
ll
do
more
than
mazes
this
year
combs
said
every
year
we
ve
seen
more
and
more
mazes
springing
up



high
tech
mazes

<collocation>corn mazes</collocation>
may
seem
like
old
fashioned
entertainment
but
they
are
actually
high
tech
mazes
are
designed
on
a
computer
the
<collocation>corn rows</collocation>
act
like
straight
lines
on
a
graph
a
gps
is
used
to
map
out
the
trails
the
paths
are
mowed
when
the
corn
is
<collocation>ankle high</collocation>


vierra
expects
about
visitors
to
his
farm
by
<collocation>halloween night</collocation>
competition
has
grown
fierce
over
the
years
<collocation>farm owners</collocation>
feel
pressured
to
create
<collocation>surprising maze</collocation>
designs



when
i
started
we
were
the
only
<collocation>corn maze</collocation>
around
here
vierra
said
he
opened
his
pumpkin
<collocation>patch business</collocation>
years
ago
now
there
are
<collocation>corn mazes</collocation>
all
over
the
place


the
halloween
<collocation>corn maze</collocation>
is
a
fairly
new
and
all
american
experience
it
first
surfaced
in
the
early
according
to
<collocation>corn mazes</collocation>
america
by
more
than
<collocation>mazes nationwide</collocation>
had
become
yearly
traditions

year
count
will
top
most
are
found
in
the
northeast
and
<collocation>great lakes</collocation>
states



it
like
disneyland


customers
expect
more
every
year
from
dave
pumpkin
patch
vierra
gives
them
what
they
want
this
season
he
installed
a
zip
line
visitors
can
ride
the
zip
line
above
the
cornfields
there
is
also
a
<collocation>free photo</collocation>
booth
visitors
can
<collocation>snap photos</collocation>
and
immediately
post
them
to
facebook



people
always
want
something
new
vierra
said
you
ve
got
to
keep
it
fresh
it
like
disneyland
always
adding
rides
and
attractions
if
you
stay
the
same
it
can
get
stale
and
there
no
reason
to
come
back


maze
<collocation>builders use</collocation>
slow
maturing
field
corn
this
way
the
<collocation>stalks stay</collocation>
green
as
long
as
possible
after
halloween
the
crop
becomes
<collocation>cattle feed</collocation>
<collocation>maize experts</collocation>
say
farms
can
make
to
from
an
<collocation>average maze</collocation>
depending
on
location
compare
that
to
an
acre
of
field
corn
which
sells
for
less
than
the
corn
costs
about
to
plant


vierra
also
grows
tons
of
<collocation>halloween pumpkins</collocation>
they
are
sold
in
<collocation>local supermarkets</collocation>
along
with
several
other
crops
but
he
does
not
plan
to
stop
creating
<collocation>corn mazes</collocation>
any
time
soon
i
plant
my
corn
aug
vierra
said
in
days
it
<collocation>feet tall</collocation>
that
perfect
for
a
maze
