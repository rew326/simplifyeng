sometimes
engineers
get
their
ideas
from
strange
places
d
printing
and
cuttlefish
don
t
seem
to
share
anything
in
common
however
engineers
have
created
a
new
d
<collocation>printing process</collocation>
they
were
inspired
by
the
cuttlefish
which
is
not
really
a
fish
it
is
a
sea
<collocation>animal related</collocation>
to
the
octopus
cuttlefishes
have
large
<collocation>stretchy bodies</collocation>
they
have
tentacles
around
their
mouths



d
printing
is
a
new
way
to
make
things
with
<collocation>full shapes</collocation>
<collocation>older printers</collocation>
could
only
make
objects
that
were
d
they
were
just
flat
two
dimensional
objects
now
d
printers
can
make
things
that
have
a
shape
first
an
object
is
designed
on
a
computer
then
the
design
is
sent
to
a
d
printer
d
printers
can
turn
plastic
into
objects
of
any
shape
these
printers
are
creating
objects
from
necklaces
to
<collocation>airplane engines</collocation>



d
printers
used
to
make
only
hard
objects
like
<collocation>car parts</collocation>
now
engineers
have
created
a
new
<collocation>printing process</collocation>
it
can
be
used
to
<collocation>print soft</collocation>
objects
this
ability
could
change
many
businesses


<collocation>mark guttag</collocation>
is
the
engineer
who
designed
the
new
<collocation>printing process</collocation>
this
project
was
originally
about
camouflage
guttag
said



playing
hide
and
seek

his
inspiration
came
from
cuttlefish
they
can
blend
into
the
surroundings
and
camouflage
themselves
it
helps
them
hide
from
predators
they
hide
by
changing
the
color
of
their
skin
they
can
also
change
the
surface
of
their
skin
they
even
can
change
how
it
feels
that
is
what
the
engineers
wanted
to
copy


guttag
wanted
to
learn
how
to
copy
the
cuttlefish
another
engineer
named
mary
boyce
worked
with
him
on
the
project


the
engineers
developed
a
d
<collocation>printing process</collocation>
it
<collocation>uses polymers</collocation>
polymers
are
the
tiny
pieces
that
make
up
plastics
polymers
are
used
in
many
materials



hard
and
soft
squeezed
together

the
engineers
used
hard
and
<collocation>soft polymers</collocation>
the
d
printer
puts
the
hard
polymers
inside
the
<collocation>soft polymers</collocation>
then
the
two
are
squeezed
the
engineers
found
that
the
<collocation>smooth surface</collocation>
of
the
<collocation>soft polymers</collocation>
becomes
similar
to
the
hard
polymer
the
hard
polymer
can
be
smooth
bumpy
or
rough
this
can
make
the
<collocation>soft polymer</collocation>
become
smooth
bumpy
or
rough
when
the
two
polymers
are
no
longer
squeezed
the
material
returns
to
its
<collocation>smooth surface</collocation>


shengqiang
cai
is
an
engineer
at
the
university
of
california
in
<collocation>san diego</collocation>
he
was
not
part
of
the
cuttlefish
study
still
he
is
very
interested
in
what
the
engineers
did
it
was
inspiring
he
said
cai
thinks
it
could
help
engineers
make
lots
of
new
<collocation>interesting materials</collocation>
it
will
also
help
us
to
understand
how
animals
like
cuttlefish
change
their
patterns
he
thinks


the
new
<collocation>printing process</collocation>
is
useful
in
other
ways
too
it
can
make
an
<collocation>object move</collocation>
through
the
air
more
easily
it
can
even
make
some
<collocation>objects waterproof</collocation>
this
new
type
of
d
printing
could
help
many
businesses
