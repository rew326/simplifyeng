<collocation>skin colors</collocation>
shakespeare
does
not
have
anything
to
say
to
them

said


her
problem
with

is
that
he
was
white
and
lived
years
ago



showing

dusbiber
opinion
caught
fire
online
and
on
radio
and

dusbiber
said
teachers
depend
too
much
on
shakespeare
plays
in
class
she
finds
this
strange


she
said
she
does
not
make
her
students
read
shakespeare
instead
they
read
books
and
poems
by
authors
who
are
not
white
dusbiber
is
white
herself


nearly
all
of
the
students
at
luther
<collocation>burbank high</collocation>
school
are
not
white
also
about
out
of
students
qualified
for
free
or
low
price
lunches
their
families
did
not
make
enough
money
to
afford
full
price
school
lunches


dusbiber
said
she
wanted
to
show
her
nonwhite
<collocation>students something</collocation>
important
she
wanted
them
to
know
that
successful
authors
have
different
<collocation>skin colors</collocation>
like
theirs
instead
of
shakespeare
her
students
read
authors
from
different
backgrounds
one
of
them
is
isabel
allende
who
was
born
in
peru
in
south
america
her
students
also
read
the
works
of
sharon
draper
an
african
american
writer
and
mexican
american
<collocation>francisco jimenez</collocation>



acting
out
romeo
and
juliet


in
her
post
dusbiber
spoke
out
against
<collocation>teaching shakespeare</collocation>
she
said
his
view
of
the
world
is
not
modern
he
also
wrote
from
the
viewpoint
of
a
white
man


by
<collocation>reading shakespeare</collocation>
students
may
think
that
other
cultures
are
less
important
dusbiber
said


a
few
miles
away
<collocation>christine baker</collocation>
teaches
at
sacramento
new
<collocation>technology high</collocation>
school
she
puts
shakespeare
into
modern
english
shakespeare
wrote
in
the
<collocation>english language</collocation>
of
years
ago
it
can
be
very
difficult
for
people
to
understand
today


four
out
of
students
at
baker
school
are
not
white


baker
does
not
agree
with
dusbiber
she
thinks
his
plays
should
be
taught
in
school
still
baker
said
shakespeare
can
be
boring
when
read
as
a
book
instead
of
as
a
play


she
asked
her
students
to
act
out
part
of
his
play
romeo
and
juliet
it
is
about
two
teenagers
who
fall
in
love
their
families
hate
each
other
and
will
not
let
them
get
married
then
she
told
her
students
to
read
the
play
on
their
own



they
get
the
feeling
of
fighting
families
of
young
love
baker
said



on
the
stage
not
on
a
desk

dusbiber
is
not
the
first
to
suggest
moving
away
from
shakespeare
in
the
classroom
<collocation>mark powell</collocation>
works
at
the
salisbury
playhouse
theater
in
england
he
wrote
that
shakespeare
words
were
chosen
to
be
spoken
or
heard
not
to
be
read
he
said
shakespeare
plays
need
to
be
performed
they
lose
all
life
when
they
are
just
read


many
people
did
not
like
dusbiber
view
most
of
the
opposition
came
from
traditional
people
who
do
not
think
the
education
system
should
change
others
though
said
students
need
to
understand
how
people
lived
and
thought
in
the
past


<collocation>ted appel</collocation>
is
the
principal
at
burbank
he
said
dusbiber
wants
students
to
read
many
different
kinds
of
books
the
goal
is
to
help
students
think
about
important
questions
and
ideas
