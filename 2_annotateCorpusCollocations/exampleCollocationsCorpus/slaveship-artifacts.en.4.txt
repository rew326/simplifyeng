<collocation>unique way</collocation>


he
said
that
the
objects
recovered

are
simple
still

feel
something
about
what
slavery
was
like



museum
hopes
to
keep
project
going

the
<collocation>national museum</collocation>
of
african
<collocation>american history</collocation>
and
culture
has
been
working
on
the
slave
wreck
project
with
five
other
groups
some
are
here
in
the
united
states
and
some
are
in
other
countries


the
shipwreck
off
the
coast
of
<collocation>south africa</collocation>
was
discovered
in
the
at
first
experts
thought
the
ship
was
an
older
boat
from
the
netherlands
then
they
began
to
study
it
more
they
realized
that
the
boat
was
from
portugal
they
also
found
out
that
it
carried
slaves


since
experts
have
been
figuring
out
who
owned
the
ship
they
also
found
papers
that
showed
what
type
of
cargo
the
ship
was
carrying
they
even
found
information
about
how
the
ship
captain
bought
a
slave


people
who
work
with
the
project
are
in
<collocation>cape town</collocation>
<collocation>south africa</collocation>
this
week
for
meetings
they
hope
the
story
of
the
shipwreck
is
just
the
first
of
many
more
discoveries


bunch
said
he
hopes
the
project
will
last
a
long
time
he
hopes
other
shipwrecks
will
be
identified
he
said
he
would
also
like
to
see
artifacts
from
those
shipwrecks
come
to
the
museum
