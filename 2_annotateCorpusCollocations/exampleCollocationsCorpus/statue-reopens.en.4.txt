the
statue
of
liberty
is
one
of
america
most
loved
monuments
but
over
and
over
<collocation>lady liberty</collocation>
has
been
kept
apart
from
her
adoring
fans
the
most
<collocation>recent breakup</collocation>
was
caused
by
an
uninvited
guest
her
name
was
sandy
she
stormed
through
leaving
behind
an
<collocation>awful mess</collocation>


since
oct
the
statue
stood
alone
in
<collocation>new york</collocation>
harbor
she
was
shut
down
by
superstorm
sandy
it
was
the
<collocation>third closure</collocation>
since
the
sept
<collocation>terror attacks</collocation>
but
the
statue
will
be
lonely
no
more
on
thursday
the
fourth
of
july
the
monument
reopened
to
visitors



i
don
t
know
about
you
but
i
m
getting
a
little
<collocation>bit tired</collocation>
of
reopening
and
closing
the
statue
of
liberty
<collocation>david luchsinger</collocation>
said
his
job
is
to
take
care
of
the
statue
i
think
this
time
we
ll
just
leave
it
alone
he
said
with
a
laugh


<collocation>lady liberty</collocation>
home
is
<collocation>liberty island</collocation>
it
takes
just
a
short
<collocation>ferry ride</collocation>
to
get
there
from
manhattan
the
year
old
woman
is
the
only
one
who
lives
there
she
stands
as
a
symbol
of
freedom



pictures
don
t
do
it
justice


visitors
fell
quiet
as
the
boat
circled
the
island
they
got
a
close
up
view
of
liberty
<collocation>strong jaw</collocation>
and
steady
gazing
eyes
many
lowered
their
<collocation>cell phones</collocation>
stopped
taking
pictures
and
just
stared



she
beautiful
said
rebecca
hines
of

ill
this
isn
t
something
you
can
capture
on
an
ipad



pictures
don
t
do
it
justice
at
all
said
her
year
old
son
alex


workers
labored
night
and
day
to
get
the
statue
reopened
in
time
for
<collocation>independence day</collocation>
a
fourth
of
july
reopening
had
been
their
goal
the
storm
sent
<collocation>record waves</collocation>
over
much
of
<collocation>new york</collocation>
<collocation>lady liberty</collocation>
survived
unharmed
but
her
home
was
trashed
the
ferry
docks
were
broken
there
was
no
electricity
or
running
water
the
walkways
and
railings
surrounding
her
base
were
a
<collocation>total loss</collocation>


the
<collocation>national park</collocation>
service
was
in
charge
of
the
repairs
it
planned
to
spend
about
million
to
<collocation>fix liberty</collocation>
island
and
nearby
<collocation>ellis island</collocation>
but
the
cost
jumped
to
million
officials
decided
to
use
better
materials
they
hope
to
prevent
the
next
big
storm
from
causing
so
much
damage


the
repairs
to
included
new
paving
stones
and
feet
of
granite
it
was
no
<collocation>small feat</collocation>
