cairo
a
<collocation>syrian community</collocation>
sits
on
the
edge
of
the
<collocation>egyptian capital</collocation>
<collocation>women tie</collocation>
their
headscarves
in
a
syrian
way
they
buy
<collocation>syrian spices</collocation>
and
trinkets
from
tables
on
the
streets
there
is
a
constant
murmur
of
stories
about
the
residents
fleeing
syrian
cities
in
the
past
year
because
of
war


the
sound
of
<collocation>egyptian men</collocation>
and
their
mothers
is
the
only
sign
that
one
is
still
in
egypt
they
flock
every
day
to
the
neighborhood
they
are
too
poor
to
take
an
<collocation>egyptian bride</collocation>
instead
they
look
for
syrian
refugees
who
they
hear
are
cheaper
prettier
better
cooks
and
easier
to
marry



i
am
looking
for

a
year
old
painter
tells
a
<collocation>syrian merchant</collocation>
outside
the
<collocation>local mosque</collocation>
they
are
less
complicated


the
syrian
has
heard
this
a
dozen
times
already
that
day
he
does
not
even
respond
instead
he
points
to
a
sign
in
front
of
the
mosque
behind
him
it
says
that
the
mosque
announces
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
marriage
of
<collocation>egyptian men</collocation>
to
syrian
sisters
that
why
there
shouldn
t
be
any
questions
regarding
this
issue
in
any
of
the
offices
of
the
organization
<collocation>may allah</collocation>
punish
those
responsible
for
spreading
these
rumors


the
painter
will
not
leave
maybe
there
are
syrian
women
around
the
corner
he
asks


the
syrian
who
gives
his
name
only
as
khalid
just
shakes
his
head



khalid
said
he
got
the
question
times
a
day
before
the
sign
now
it
is
only
it
is
difficult
to
know
if
he
exaggerating



not
for
sale



they
ask
us
where
the
office
is
to
buy
a
syrian
woman
as
if
they
are
buying
a
chicken
said
khalid
who
said
he
is
our
women
are
not
for
sale
we
are
here
because
we
did
not
want
to
be
killed

marwa

in

egyptians

<collocation>egyptian men</collocation>
now
poorer

syrian

say
the

approach
them
alaa

who
fled
damascus
three
months
ago
to
cairo
she
says
getting
bothered
has
been
one
of
her
<collocation>biggest challenges</collocation>



this
is
not
the
time
to
marry
and
celebrate
and

life
alaa
said
that
is
because
of
what
is
happening
in

the
situation
is
changing

across
egypt
women
say
that
<collocation>men demand</collocation>
more
of

less
once
an
egyptian
man
was
expected
to
provide
a
home
and
prove
he
can
work
before
he
could
marry
now
many
believe
they
can
have
a
<collocation>syrian bride</collocation>
for
as
little
as



looking
where
syrians
are

the
men
come
to
places
where
syrians
gather
the
men
hope
to
escape
forced
marriages
or
no
prospects
at
all


for
the
syrians
defending
women
has
become
a
means
to
maintain
their
dignity


nearly
syrian
refugees
live
in
egypt
the
united
nations
says
most
are
in
and
around
cairo


one
women
organization
said
that
syrian
women
married
<collocation>egyptian men</collocation>
in
the
last
year
but
egyptian
officials
have
a
much
different
number
between
january
and
march
marriages
happened
it
says


neither
side
wants
to
admit
they
are
involved
syrians
here
find
<collocation>such claims</collocation>
insulting
egyptian
women
do
not
want
to
admit
that
their
men
could
find
syrian
women
more
attractive


some
<collocation>muslim religious</collocation>
leaders
have
told
<collocation>egyptian men</collocation>
to
marry
syrian
women
they
say
they
should
do
it
to
be
generous
<collocation>top members</collocation>
of
the
<collocation>muslim brotherhood</collocation>
are
rumored
to
have
taken
syrian
women
as
<collocation>second wives</collocation>
the
brotherhood
is
a
<collocation>secretive religious</collocation>
society
it
helped
mohammed
morsi
become
president
of
egypt


earlier
this
month
a
women
group
condemned
the
push
to
marry
syrian
women
it
even
set
up
a
hotline
for
syrians
to
call
and
complain


the
number
doesn
t
work
