scientists
have
long
believed
that
dinosaurs
only
lived
on
land
now
<collocation>strange dinosaur</collocation>
bones
found
in
morocco
may
prove
them
wrong


the
million
year
old
dinosaur
is
known
as
<collocation>spinosaurus aegyptiacus</collocation>
new
evidence
shows
it
spent
much
of
its
life
in
water


<collocation>spinosaurus dinosaurs</collocation>
have
been
known
about
for
years
it
now
seems
that
scientists
didn
t
really
understand
what
they
were
like



it
was
not
a
balancing
two
legged
animal
on
land
said
scientist
<collocation>paul sereno</collocation>
it
would
have
been
something
very
peculiar



a
fish
eating
dinosaur

at
feet
long
spinosaurus
was
likely
the
largest
meat
eating
dinosaur
ever
it
was
nine
feet
longer
than
tyrannosaurus
rex


spinosaurus
had
a
mouth
and
teeth
that
were
perfect
for
snapping
at
fish
its
<collocation>small nostrils</collocation>
were
far
up
on
its
head
having
them
there
let
<collocation>spinosaurus stick</collocation>
its
nose
in
the
water
and
still
breathe


it
had
<collocation>strong arms</collocation>
with
sharp
claws
to
<collocation>catch slippery</collocation>
fish
its
<collocation>shorter legs</collocation>
weren
t
really
designed
to
walk
well
on
land
its
feet
were
wide
and
flat
they
might
even
have
been
webbed


spinosaurus
had
a
bony
sail
on
its
back
which
stayed
above
the
water
as
it
swam
the
spiny
sail
helped
it
glide
through
the
water



a
box
of
fossils

the
first
<collocation>spinosaurus dinosaur</collocation>
was
discovered
in
egypt
in
it
was
carefully
studied
by
<collocation>german scientist</collocation>
ernst
stromer


stromer
took
the
skeleton
with
him
back
to
germany
but
the
bones
were
destroyed
during
<collocation>world war</collocation>
ii
except
for
the
<collocation>drawings stromer</collocation>
made
all
evidence
of
the
discovery
was
lost


the
story
didn
t
end
there
it
was
picked
up
years
later
by
<collocation>nizar ibrahim</collocation>


ibrahim
is
a
paleontologist
that
is
a
scientist
who
studies
the
history
of
life
before
humans
he
studies
<collocation>ancient bones</collocation>
known
as
fossils


in
ibrahim
went
to
morocco
to
search
for
fossils
one
day
a
man
approached
him
with
a
<collocation>cardboard box</collocation>


inside
the
box
were
<collocation>ancient bones</collocation>
one
was
a
<collocation>strange fossil</collocation>
shaped
like
a
blade
it
had
a
<collocation>red line</collocation>
running
through
it



looking
for
the
<collocation>mystery man</collocation>

sometime
later
ibrahim
visited
a
museum
in
italy
scientists
there
told
him
about
some
<collocation>strange fossils</collocation>
in
the
<collocation>museum basement</collocation>
they
said
the
bones
had
been
sent
from
morocco



my
jaw
dropped
ibrahim
said
among
the
bones
were
several
like
those
he
already
had
strange
blade
shaped
fossils
with
the
same
<collocation>red line</collocation>


ibrahim
thought
that
his
bones
and
the
ones
in
italy
came
from
the
same
animal


ibrahim
wanted
to
find
the
man
with
the
box
he
didn
t
know
his
name
all
he
could
remember
was
the
town
he
lived
in
and
that
the
man
had
a
mustache


ibrahim
returned
to
morocco
there
he
searched
for
the
<collocation>mystery man</collocation>
with
no
luck
he
was
just
about
to
give
up
when
a
familiar
looking
man
walked
by


sure
enough
it
was
the
man
with
the
mustache



finding
more
bones

the
man
took
him
to
the
spot
where
he
had
found
the
fossils
to
ibrahim
excitement
even
more
spinosaurus
bones
were
there


ibrahim
also
traveled
to
germany
there
stromer
granddaughter
gave
him
stromer
sketches
of
the
<collocation>egyptian skeleton</collocation>


ibrahim
now
had
stromer
drawings
and
the
bones
from
italy
and
morocco
to
work
with
he
could
put
together
a
model
of
the
<collocation>spinosaurus skeleton</collocation>


it
was
that
model
which
led
to
ibrahim
groundbreaking
discovery
spinosaurus
had
spent
much
of
its
life
in
water
